What about the wrapper makes the underlying deadlines no longer work?  But\nthe wrapper DOES work with the deadlines if the deadlines are smaller (or negative), so\nsomehow the wrapper only masks 50-100ms and longer deadlines??  Is something wrongly\nrenewing the deadlines?\n\n(at least right now on Linux, but I seem to recall this also failing on OS X)\u003c/pre\u003e",
