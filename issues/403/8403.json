As of 1.3,\nan error is returned that looks like 'request Content-Type isn't multipart/form-data'. \nI couldn't find this behavior change anywhere in the release notes.\n\nThis different behavior seems logical, although less convenient for my use case.  What\nstrikes me as unusual is that it's not totally backwards compatible and there doesn't\nseem to be mention of in the release notes.  Was this an intentional change or an\noversight?  Will it be changed back or should I work around it?\u003c/pre\u003e",
