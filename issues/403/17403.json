	"body": "4c79ed5f4483f1de065ba2b409de58ae2b6907d2 caused a regression where a round-trip zip file does not preserve the same ModTime. The reason is because the logic for using extra timestamp is always applied in the Writer no matter what.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue for when the user doesn't set the ModifiedDate and ModifiedTime fields at all. Causing the Writer to convert a zero MS-DOS timestamp (gibberish) to a Unix timestamp (now gibberish) and back again. The fix is to only apply Extra timestamp only if the MS-DOS timestamp is non-zero.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/4c79ed5f4483f1de065ba2b409de58ae2b6907d2/src/archive/zip/writer.go#L102-L109\r\n\r\n/cc @mattn",
