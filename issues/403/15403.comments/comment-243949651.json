You might want to just add (perhaps hackily) what you need directly into the `runtime` package for now and let it get cleaned up later.\r\n\r\nAlong those lines it would be easy to add the variables `runtime.hwcap` (already there for arm) and `runtime.hwcap2` and then grab them using assembly in other packages when necessary.  Ideally they'd both have the type `uint32` and be defined and set in os_linux.go (rather than in an arch-dependent file).\r\n\r\nThe constants representing features could go in the `runtime/internal/sys` package but that means they can only be accessed in the `runtime` package. If you instead put them in a global package like `internal/cpu` then the `runtime` package can't get at them. That could be a way to get this proposal started though.\r\n",
