There is no constant folding\nthough, this package is to check cpu capability at runtime, so I think an\nAPI that looks like this is fine:\n\ncpu.Has(feats cpu.Feature...)\n\nE.g.:\ncpu.Has(cpu.FloatingPoint, cpu.AES, ...)\n\nYeah, we need to figure out a way to name and category the CPU features.\nShould each arch be in a separate package (e.g. internal/CPU/arm?) Or\nprefix each feature with arch name? Do we consolidate common features\nacross arches?\n",
