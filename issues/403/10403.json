	"body": "Should we drop support for OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard in Go 1.5? In Go 1.6?\nIt's 5 years old and not supported by Apple anymore.\nIt was the last OS X to support 32-bit machines, which is why we've kept it this long.\nBut there are problems with cmd/cgo on these old systems that we're just never going to fix (for example #8009 and #9967).\n\nWe should still keep darwin/386 until Apple stops running 32-bit binaries on 64-bit systems, since it's useful to be able to run 386 all.bash on OS X machines.",
