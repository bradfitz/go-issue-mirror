Also Golang is (strangely?) missing from the benchmarking results as per eg https://performance-dot-grpc-testing.appspot.com/explore?dashboard=5712453606309888\u0026widget=828849126\u0026container=1808124444\u0026maximized \r\n\r\n(BTW there are huge gaps between C++ at 250K QPS/sec vs Java at 150K QPS/sec vs C# at 20K QPS/sec -- especially the last two I would expect to be similar. And these are all async calls, in our case we'd be using synchronous calls).\r\n",
