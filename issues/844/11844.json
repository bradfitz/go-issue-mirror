Before that CL, people could easily copy cmd/gofmt and make their own variants (for example, gofmt as an RPC service). Now they cannot, because their copies will not be allowed to import \"internal/format\". If cmd/gofmt cannot be written using public APIs alone, that's probably a sign that the public APIs are incomplete or inadequate.\r\n\r\nCC @griesemer",
