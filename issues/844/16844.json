	"body": "The package has outstanding bugs that are hard to fix, and cannot support TLS without major work. So although it has a nice API and allows one to use native Go types without an IDL, it should probably be retired.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to freeze the package, retire the many bugs filed against it, and add documentation indicating that it is frozen and that suggests alternatives such as GRPC.",
