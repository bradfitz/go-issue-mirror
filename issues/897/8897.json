	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWe need to remove all guarantees with respect to data races from the language\nspecification, effectively leaving them as undefined behavior or at least\nimplementation-defined behavior (as there can potentially be a more secure\nimplementation that provides basic safety guarantees in presence of data races). Pretend\nthat it's bug fix wrt Go1 guarantee.\nTwo reasons:\n1. Current implementations don't implement what's specified about data races in the\nspec. Gcc and llvm middle-ends assume race-free programs.\n2. Sapphire concurrent GC algorithm assumes race-free programs as well.\nFixing the implementations will incur extremely high cost.\n\nHere is proposed wording:\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/101330056/diff/40001/doc/go_mem.html\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/101330056/diff/40001/doc/go_mem.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
