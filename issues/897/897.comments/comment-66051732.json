It might not need to be part of\nall.bash but just an easy-to-run command.\n\nFor example, if goinstall kept a local log of which packages\nit had downloaded and installed, we could make \n\ngoinstall -a\n\nmean \"reinstall all the packages\".  This would also\nhelp updating: goinstall -a -u could mean \"update and\ninstall all the packages\".\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
