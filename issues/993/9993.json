	"body": "I am sorry for the imprecise nature of this issue. The symptoms are random SIGSEGV's after processes have been running for several minutes. The most visible effect of this is `go test std` will segfault half way through the test run, making it impossible to complete a CI build.\r\n\r\nLast year @mwhudson and I saw a similar issue with gccgo-4.9 compiled programs which was eventually traced to the page size of the machine, most ppc64 machines use 64k pages, being out of sync with the page size of that the runtime uses.\r\n\r\nIn tracing some processes today I have found occurences of `munmap(2)` and `madvise(2)` calls that are not using multiples of 64k\r\n```\r\nmunmap(0x3fff82b40000, 26532)           = 0\r\n```\r\nMore worrying, I've found examples that don't use a multiple of 4096 bytes!\r\n```\r\nmunmap(0x3fff80e10000, 102680)          = 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n/cc @randall77 ",
