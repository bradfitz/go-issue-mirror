	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe linker is too slow. More work needs to be done during package building instead. The\nlinker can now incorporate ELF-style pre-assembled .o files. If we generate them too\nthen we can do a pre-link during the package building, once per package, and reap the\nsavings of not having to re-assemble everything once per binary using a package. The\narchives might get epsilon smaller too. \n\nAs Ken wrote in \u003ca href=\"http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/compiler.html\"\u003ehttp://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/compiler.html\u003c/a\u003e:\n\u0026quot;Two problems have come up in retrospect. The first has to do with the division of\nlabor between compiler and loader. Plan 9 runs on multi-processors and as such\ncompilations are often done in parallel. Unfortunately, all compilations must be\ncomplete before loading can begin. The load is then single-threaded. With this model,\nany shift of work from compile to load results in a significant increase in real time.\nThe same is true of libraries that are compiled infrequently and loaded often. In the\nfuture, we may try to put some of the loader work back into the compiler.\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e",
