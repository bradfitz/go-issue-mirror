The problem with a Go implementation is the same\nauthors (us) will make the same (sometimes wrong) assumptions on both the child and host\nimplementations, and then we'll have a false sense of confidence in our implementation.\n\nI'm also find keeping it in Perl.  The test should be skipped if Perl isn't available,\nso it shouldn't affect anybody.\u003c/pre\u003e",
