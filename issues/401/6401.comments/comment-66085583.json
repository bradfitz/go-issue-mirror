The code must check that the two paths have\nthe same leading directory and then pass only the final element.\n\nHowever, the first half of the suggestion is wrong too: os.Rename is allowed to fail for\ndifferent directories and on Plan 9 it should. It is a mistake to do the Copy behind the\nuser's back. os.Rename can fail on Unix too, if the directories are on different file\nsystems.\n\nSince Plan 9 is not a supported system, this will have to wait until Go 1.3.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **go1.3**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
