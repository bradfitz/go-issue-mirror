	"body": "As we discussed earlier offline, we're going to build OpenAL-soft from the source code for the Android target (and eventually for Windows). I have pushed a working prototype to https://github.com/rakyll/al. Merging changes from the upstream to the cgo OpenAL port could be challenging, we're looking for alternatives such as generating the flattened package.\r\n\r\nOn darwin, OpenAL is already available. We will depend on what's been shipped.\r\n\r\nWe expect Linux desktop users to install libopenal manually for now. Desktop targets are not our top priority, but we can improve the experience there once we got the package stabilized on Android and iOS.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, OpenSL has been introduced to Android after Froyo. So, the bindings won't work on pre-Froyo Android versions, or will require some additional work.",
