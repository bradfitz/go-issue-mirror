One drawback is that you have to load all of the dependencies before invoking application's ANativeActivity_onCreate.\r\n\r\nOur current model doesn't allow this scenario. We may need to have a libbootstrap.so that will dynamically load the dependencies and then the libapp.so and invoke its ANativeActivity_onCreate.",
