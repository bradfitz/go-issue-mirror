	"body": "We shouldn't go for that approach, because it's not scalable. The point we need another external dependency, we will require the bindings to do the dlopen/dlsym dance for Android.\r\n\r\nI haven't mentioned earlier but, one drawback of having to dlopen is that Android is not setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to a sane value. So, you have to load the libraries packed in the APK from /data/data/PACKAGE_NAMESPACE/lib as the installer unpacks them to that exact directory. If you don't want to deal with this, we can call System.loadLibrary from the native context.",
