Those files\nare generated by the mkerrors.sh script in the pkg/syscall directory.  When I run\nmkerrors.sh on my Ubuntu Precise amd64 system, I see EPOLLET defined as 0x80000000, not\n-0x80000000.  This is only for 386 and amd64, not arm.\n\nI see a few other additions, which are harmless.  In zerrors_linux_386.go, I see changes\nto the values of F_GETLK, F_SETLK, and F_SETLKW; that looks like a bug.\n\nAnyhow, I think this problem may simply be fixed.  At least if you rebuild the files on\na 64-bit host.  It would be interesting to see what zerrors_linux_arm.go looks like\nafter running mkerrors.sh on an ARM system.\u003c/pre\u003e",
