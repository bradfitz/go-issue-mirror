That's how people notice that there is something wrong and report it here. Adding global sequencing just for error detection does not look like a good idea to me, tracing is not particularly low frequency.\r\nI think we need to improve error message that is printed by cmd/trace and describe some common reasons for broken traces (VMs, old processors, broken OSes).\r\n\r\n\u003e How do you propose to address that?\r\n\r\nThis is a good question.\r\nHopefully it is not too bad, because we see only complaints and we don't hear from people for whom it works. I personally tried tracer on linux, darwin and windows laptops and linux and windows desktops. It worked flawlessly everywhere.\r\nBut that's not to say that there are no issues.\r\nI see only one way how we can improve the situation. For processors that provide stable-frequency ticks and support RDTSCP, we can try to synchronize across CPUs manually (by measuring RTT across different cores). I never tried that, so can't say how reliable it will be and what portion of systems it will fix.\r\nBesides that I hope that processors manufactured in 2006 will die over time and OSes will become better...\r\n",
