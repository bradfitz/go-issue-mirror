For processors that provide stable-frequency ticks and support RDTSCP, we can try to synchronize across CPUs manually (by measuring RTT across different cores).\r\n\r\nYou could also do this after-the-fact by piecing together constraints from the recorded trace to compute each CPU's offset. I'm not convinced that it's actually possible to do this up-front in user space given things like dynamic cgroup CPU masks.",
