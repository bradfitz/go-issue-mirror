It sounded like you were saying that it wasn't\npossible.\n\nCan you provide some color on why it would not be an acceptable approach?  I mean\nobviously we would have to recompile everything, and it would have performance\nimplications.  But is there some fundamental reason (e.g. we need to be compatible with\ncalling convention X that language Y uses)?\n\nI understand that today Golang has simple method semantics, and that the odds of this\nbecoming part of Golang before generics are low.  But maybe that's because you haven't\nseen all the amazing things this simple change unlocks.  Or maybe not - we'll see!\u003c/pre\u003e",
