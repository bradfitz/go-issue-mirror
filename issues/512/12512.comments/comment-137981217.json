(e.g. it's coming from the network, via an HTTP request or response or whatever). You can read the header, verify its properties, and then decode the rest of the image with the already-read header re-stitched on to the front like this:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nvar header bytes.Buffer\r\nconf, err := png.DecodeConfig(io.TeeReader(streamReader, \u0026header))\r\nif err != nil || !confValid(conf) { ... }\r\nim, err := png.Decode(io.MultiReader(\u0026header, streamReader)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the docs for io.TeeReader and io.MultiReader to see how that works.\r\n",
