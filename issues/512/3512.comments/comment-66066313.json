That was just one example of a user of this.\n\nI think you're making this sound more complicated than it is.  And I think one of us is\nusing the wrong vocabulary.  (I don't want to \"intern []byte\" because I can't intern a\nmutable thing)\n\nI just want m[string(byteSlice)] to avoid a copy and to instead create a fake String\nheader temporary.  It never escapes the hashmap functions, so it's safe.\n\nAnd no language semantics change which weren't already racy and undefined.\n\nExample:\n\nm := map[string]int{\n   \"X\": 1,\n   \"Y\": 2,\n}\nmutate := func(b []byte) { b[0] = 'Y' }\nkey := []byte{'X'}\ngo mutate(key)\nvalue, ok := m[string(key)]\n\nWhat is value \u0026 ok?\n\n  1, true?\n  2, true?\n  0, false?\n\nIt's already undefined.\u003c/pre\u003e",
