I need to work with potentially big and rather nested XML.  For debugging and friendliness to diff I would like to save files with each element printed on its own line. However even with `Indent(\"\", \" \")` I got a significant increase in file size. I can work-around that with a regexp that strips initial spaces from each line with xml elements, but it would be nice if `Indent(\"\", \"\")` worked as expected.",
