For someone looking at the two iterations above,\ndeprived of any further insights on the choice made, it really doesn't make sense, if\nyou forgive my frankness.\n\nI can certainly see the pragmatic reason why it works this way, but it feels like a\nlanguage design wart which could be avoided (avoiding with it the surprise and future\nbugs) by either putting the feature in the library, or by optimizing the compilation of\n\"range []int(...)\" to what it does right now.).\n\nEither way, I've already presented the argument here and in the mailing list (hopefully\nin a clear way). Unless there's further interest from the designers in seeing this\nfixed/changed, it probably won't help much to continue the discussion.\u003c/pre\u003e",
