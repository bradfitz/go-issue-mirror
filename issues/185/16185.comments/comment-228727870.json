Why not oblique? Or BoldOblique? Etc)\r\n\r\nFreetype not being in the standard lib notwithstanding, it would be more useful to me to have a package that queries the system for what fonts are available, or all fonts that are available with a certain property (bold, italic, font family, font name,etc) perhaps with some helpers to get things like the default system monospace font or the default system sans serif font. Users would still need to import the freetype package to parse the file, but they need to do that in any other programming language too, and simply querying the OS font database shouldn't have any licensing problems.",
