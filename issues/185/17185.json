	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ntip\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nUbuntu 16.04 ppc64le\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\nBuilt and ran the math package benchmark test.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nBetter performance for floor, ceil, and trunc functions in math package.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\nRoom for improvement\r\n\r\nThe Power instruction set includes frim, frip, and friz which can be used to implement the Go math package's floor, ceil, and trunc functions more efficiently.  These instructions are used in the existing gccgo implementation for these math functions for ppc64x.  These are compatible with power5 so can be used in both ppc64le \u0026 ppc64.\r\n",
