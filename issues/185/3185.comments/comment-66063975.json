Those failures are tests that expect\nto only run once (e.g. because they mutate a global). We could change the tests to be\nimmune to that, but in some cases that would also require changes to their packages.\n\nPerhaps the -cpu flag should result in the test binary being invoked as a subprocess\nafresh for each value.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
