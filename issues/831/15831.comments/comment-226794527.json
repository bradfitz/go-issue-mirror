As far as I can tell, there's nothing preventing that from happening.\r\n\r\nWe haven't actually used poisonStack since April 2015, when we switched to 1-bit bitmaps for the stack (and lost the information we would need to poison the stack). I'm not sure if something used to prevent us from legitimately allocating at that address.\r\n\r\nWe should probably just remove poisonStack and the checks against that pointer.",
