	"body": "Looks like the memory span had an empty free list but was on the nonempty span list.  The traceback shows the call to `c.empty.remove` in mcentral.go:mcentral.freeSpan:\r\n\r\n    \twasempty := s.freelist.ptr() == nil\r\n    \t...\r\n    \tif wasempty {\r\n    \t\tc.empty.remove(s)\r\n    \t\tc.nonempty.insert(s)\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\nThe print before the panic shows that the span's list field, expected to point to `c.empty`, instead points to `c.nonempty`.\r\n\r\nI don't understand this code.  It's clear that `mallocgc` can leave a span's freelist set to `nil`, and I don't see anything moving that span from the `nonempty` list to the `empty` list in that case.",
