	"body": "The current version of httptrace allows tracking most states of a request's live cycle, except for an overall error (all dials failed or protocol errors) and the closing of the response body. Both of these things can already be tracked by writing a custom RoundTripper, however if httptrace had hooks for these things, it would allow for the full instrumentation (e.g. metrics and tracing) of requests without needing to split it up between two mechanisms.\r\n\r\n/cc @bradfitz ",
