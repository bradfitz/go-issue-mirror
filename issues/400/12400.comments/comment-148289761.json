In fact, all I could find was this sentence which suggests that it's fine to use the numeric entity instead:\r\n\r\n\u003e Entity and character references may both be used to escape the left angle bracket, ampersand, and other delimiters. A set of general entities (amp, lt, gt, apos, quot) is specified for this purpose. Numeric character references may also be used; they are expanded immediately when recognized and must be treated as character data, so the numeric character references \" \u0026#60; \" and \" \u0026#38; \" may be used to escape \u003c and \u0026 when they occur in character data.\r\n\r\nI'd be inclined _not_ to change the existing behavior because—as @nodirt says—this may break (or at least unexpectedly change) existing programs.",
