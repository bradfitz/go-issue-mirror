Let me know if you agree/disagree with me.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype ClientTrace struct {\r\n\t// GetConnFailed is called when no connection could be obtained.\r\n\t// It will be called at most once per request. The individual Dial\r\n\t// errors will be reported by calls to ConnectDone.\r\n\tGetConnFailed func()\r\n\r\n\t// BodyClosed is called after the response body has been closed.\r\n\t// If err is nil, no read or close error occured. If err is\r\n\t// non-nil, it contains the first error that was returned by Read\r\n\t// or Close.\r\n\tBodyClosed func(err error)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should allow complete instrumentation of a request, without needing a custom RoundTripper or user-code after Close. If the request couldn't be made at all, either GetConnFailed or WroteRequest with a non-nil Err in WroteRequestInfo will be called. If the request could be made, but an error occured while reading from the body, BodyClosed will be called with a non-nil error. If no errors occured, BodyClosed will be called with a nil error.",
