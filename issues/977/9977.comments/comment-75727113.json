What will portability look like?\r\n\r\nWithout solving the portability story, I consider the actual packaging and loading of a dynamic package to be the easy part. The hard part is linking, and right now we have nothing better (and maybe cannot?) than dlsym.\r\n\r\nI also don't know the use case. I understand audio, but it is a one-off we want to build into the standard mobile packages (and only needs a library loaded on android), so it would not use such an interface. Without seeing how it would be used I don't want to build it.",
