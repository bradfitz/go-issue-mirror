We may have a hard requirement for external libraries to be linked statically only.\r\n\r\nDynamic linking is useful if you want to fallback to another library depending on some condition you can evaluate only during runtime. \r\n\r\n(For the audio package's use-case, the implementation details doesn't have to be known. I haven't filed the issue because of my experience with the audio package.)",
