In many other\nstandards, the meaning of gamma has changed over the  years.  Originally, it computed\nthe logarithm of the absolute value of the mathematical gamma function, with an external\nint, signgam, being set to the sign of the gamma function.  Then gamma was replaced with\nlgamma, and gamma was slated to be withdrawn.  About that time, NCEG changed gamma to\ncompute the mathematical gamma function, and that is what was adopted into C99 CD1; but\nit appears that the old meaning of gamma has not yet been withdrawn, so there would have\nbeen a conflict between C99 and current industry practice.  C99 therefore changed the\nname in the FCD to tgamma, meaning “true gamma,” to avoid this conflict.\n\nC99 originally had tgamma(0) = NaN, but by TC2 (probably also TC1) they had changed it\nto tgamma(+0) = +Inf, tgamma(-0) = -Inf.  Other non-positive integers do not have\n\"sides\", so they are NaN instead.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/dr_244.htm\"\u003ehttp://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/dr_244.htm\u003c/a\u003e looks to be the defect report\nthat led to the change.\n\nI believe we should match (the new) C99 in the absence of expert arguments to the\ncontrary, meaning:\n\n    Special cases are:\n\n\tGamma(+Inf) = +Inf\n\tGamma(+0) = +Inf\n\tGamma(-0) = -Inf\n\tGamma(x) = NaN for integer x \u0026lt; 0\n\tGamma(-Inf) = NaN\n\tGamma(NaN) = NaN\n\nThe attached program prints:\n\n\tnetlib\tgamma\tlgamma\ttgamma\ninf\tinf\tinf\tinf\tinf\n-inf\tnan\tnan\tinf\tnan\n0\tnan\tinf\tinf\tinf\n-0\tnan\t-inf\tinf\t-inf\n-1\tnan\tnan\tinf\tnan\n-2\tnan\tnan\tinf\tnan\n-3\tnan\tnan\tinf\tnan\n-4\tnan\tnan\tinf\tnan\n-5\tnan\tnan\tinf\tnan\n-6\tnan\tnan\tinf\tnan\n-7\tnan\tnan\tinf\tnan\n-8\tnan\tnan\tinf\tnan\n-9\tnan\tnan\tinf\tnan\n\nThe netlib column is the netlib source that the Go file claims to have started with,\nalthough it in a different place on netlib now and I cut out all the #ifdefs and ran it\nthrough cb.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2977/2/gamma.c\"\u003egamma.c\u003c/a\u003e (3434 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2977/2/Screen%20shot%202012-02-10%20at%2012.25.47%20AM.png\"\u003eScreen shot 2012-02-10 at 12.25.47 AM.png\u003c/a\u003e (100773 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2977/2/Screen%20shot%202012-02-10%20at%2012.26.33%20AM.png\"\u003eScreen shot 2012-02-10 at 12.26.33 AM.png\u003c/a\u003e (104552 bytes)",
