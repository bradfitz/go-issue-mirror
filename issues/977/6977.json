	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIf you view an interface as a set of constraints on the implementing type, then\ncombining two interfaces (that are not mutually incompatible) such as:\n\n  type I interface { f(); String() string }\n  type J interface { g(); String() string } \n\nhas a natural interpretation that is equivalent to an interface containing the union of\nsuch constraints.  e.g. these should be equivalent:\n\n  type IJ interface { I; J }\n  type IJ interface { f(); g(); String() string }\n\nbut in fact the first is an error: \u0026quot;duplicate method: String\u0026quot;.  This is\nsomewhat surprising.  Is there any reason not to permit this?  The set-union behaviour\nis easy to understand, describe and implement, and it seems useful in practise when you\nhave overlapping interfaces describing different aspects of a type.\n\n(I chose String() string since I've seen many users add this constraint to their\ninterfaces.  It could be any method though.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
