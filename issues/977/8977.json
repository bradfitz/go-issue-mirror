	"body": "by **matt.knopp**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIn tcpip.go, forward(...) and remote(...) scan forwardList entries for an entry that\nmatches laddr on both IP and PORT as part of creating/removing a forward channel. It\nlooks like it should only be comparing on PORT rather than PORT and IP.\n\nI came across this because some SSH servers (e.g. Apache Mina) (appear?) to pass the\noriginating interface's IP  when creating a 'forwarded-tcpip' channel rather than the IP\nwe requested, e.g. 0.0.0.0. The forwarding request is ultimately rejected because\nforward() is unable to find a matching IP, PORT pair in forwardList. Removing the IP\ncheck appears to fix the problem.\n\nRFC-4253 states \u0026quot;Implementations MUST reject these messages unless they have\npreviously requested a remote TCP/IP port forwarding with the given port number\u0026quot;. \n\nMatt\u003c/pre\u003e",
