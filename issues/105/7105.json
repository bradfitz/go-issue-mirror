	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eUsually, when a function returns an error, its other return values are considered\nundefined. The current implementation of strconv.ParseInt, however, makes sure to return\nmeaningful values even in error cases. For format errors, it always returns 0 instead of\nleaking parser state, and for overflow it returns the biggest/smallest possible value\nand preserves the sign, as opposed to just wrapping around or behaving in other\nunexpected ways.\n\nThese attributes can simplify code at the caller site, but only if they are documented\nand guaranteed to stay in future versions and other implementations of the standard\nlibrary.\n\nIf they are in fact intended parts of the API, they should be documented as such.\u003c/pre\u003e",
