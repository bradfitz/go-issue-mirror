I believe the problem is that the wildcard x/... is\nincluding x/ (instead of x) as one of its expansions. Other things depend on juju/cmd\nand so the build ends up building both juju/cmd/ and juju/cmd, which end up stepping on\neach other. You can see the problem in the 'go list' output you gave, where the first\nline listed ends in a slash. However, I cannot reproduce this locally: go list hash/...\nlists 'hash' not 'hash/'. Perhaps another cleanup fixed this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
