The register allocator uses more copies than are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe indexing produces code like:\r\n```\r\n  y = x + 1\r\n  load from p + x + 1\r\n```\r\nThe latter is a single complex-addressing mode load, and the x+1 was folded into it.\r\nIn between those two instructions, both y and x are live.  So the y=x+1 can't be done in place and a bunch of moves need to fix things up afterward.\r\n\r\nI'll try to fix this up during the 1.8 cycle.\r\n",
