It's a painful\nlesson to learn!\n\nIt's probably not as much a problem for windows now as it was in the past\n(command.com vs cmd.exe) but it's just better to avoid them because\nthere are tools that barf on them.\n\nI agree, something prominent that discourages the foolhardy from attempting\nto use the dastardly things.\n\n-joe\u003c/pre\u003e",
