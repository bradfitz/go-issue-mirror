Thus, we strongly recommend that you do not install MinGW in any location with spaces in the path name reference; i.e. you should avoid installing into any subdirectory of \"Program Files\" or \"My Documents\", or the like.\n\nMaybe we should follow that advise? Perhaps, it will save someone else trouble in the\nfuture, if we just assume (only for the purpose of mingw build) our GOROOT doesn't have\nspaces on windows.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
