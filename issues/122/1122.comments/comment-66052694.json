At least, somehow I doubt fixing MinGW/GNU Make has anything\nto do with Go. Building from a path with spaces in it was intentional, to see whether or\nnot it would work ;).\n\n\nAlso while don't use spaces in pathnames is the golden rule of programming, using double\nquotes on environment variables you want used as one word is also the golden rule of\nunix sh programming-doesn't take a Wizard to figure it out either.\u003c/pre\u003e",
