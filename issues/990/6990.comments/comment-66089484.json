It handles -0 but nothing else.  Although interestingly the only current\nfailures with testlib are tests that run.go doesn't run (sinit, safe/nousesafe,\nfixedbugs/bug302).\n\nIt seems to me that updating testlib to handle flags for errorcheck and run is about the\nsame as updating testlib to handle flags for errorcheck and to add runflags.  But if you\nthink a new verb is the best approach I suppose I'm OK with it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
