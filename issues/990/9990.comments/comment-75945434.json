It doesn't happen on Fossil.\r\n\r\nLike Fossil, the ramfs file server can return a \"directory not empty\" error,\r\nwhen removing a non-empty directory.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/0intro/plan9/blob/c0f3d9/sys/src/cmd/ramfs.c#L601\r\n\r\nHowever, RemoveAll, like the rm tool on Plan 9, always removes the\r\ncontent of a directory before removing the directory itself.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/0intro/plan9/blob/c0f3d9/sys/src/cmd/rm.c#L21\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/1eea5c/src/os/path.go#L66\r\n\r\nI suppose there is some subtle difference between Fossil and ramfs\r\nand between RemoveAll and rmdir() on Plan 9.",
