It's clearly\npossible to use Cmd.Stdin directly if you set it to a file or an os.Pipe.  Perhaps it is\ndifficult to use it for a general io.Reader, I'm not sure.\n\nThe difficulty arises if you set it to another io.Reader and you don't expect the child\nprocess to read all its input. In that case, Run (or Wait) will return a broken pipe\nerror if the child didn't read all its input (\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/bODUysTV1l\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/bODUysTV1l\u003c/a\u003e\ndemonstrates that). It's difficult to distinguish between that error and any other error\n(eg. the process having died due to a signal).\n\nIt seems to me now that one should always use StdinPipe in those situations. If that's\ntrue, I will send a doc CL that makes it explicit after Go 1.3 is out.\u003c/pre\u003e",
