There are two weird things I see here:\nThis is another difference in behaviour between *os.File and other io.Readers\nThis makes it largely impossible to use Cmd.Stdin directly (ie. not by calling\nStdinPipe) if we don't want to treat an early exit from the child process as an error.\u003c/pre\u003e",
