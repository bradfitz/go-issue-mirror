While the\nidentifier of the inner declaration is in scope, it denotes the entity declared by the\ninner declaration. \"\n\n\" Unlike regular variable declarations, a short variable declaration may redeclare\nvariables provided they were originally declared earlier in the same block with the same\ntype, and at least one of the non-blank variables is new. As a consequence,\nredeclaration can only appear in a multi-variable short declaration. Redeclaration does\nnot introduce a new variable; it just assigns a new value to the original. \"\u003c/pre\u003e",
