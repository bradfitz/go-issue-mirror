	"body": "The gomobile tests currently depend on the availability of the `fonts-droid` package (or more correctly, the DroidSanf font). According to [this issue from last November](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=804683), debian dropped maintaining the `fonts-droid` package in favor of the choice of Android `fonts-noto`. As such, newer Ubuntu releases don't have the droid fonts available any more (Xenial and upward), so gomobile tests will always fail there.",
