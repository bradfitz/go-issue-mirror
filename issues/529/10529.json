	"body": "The testing package provides a timeout flag, \"if positive, sets an aggregate time limit for all tests\", which defaults to zero (no timeout).\r\n\r\nIn https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/8998/ I wanted a timeout for an individual TestFooBar test. It wasn't too hard to implement myself, but it should be part of the standard testing library.",
