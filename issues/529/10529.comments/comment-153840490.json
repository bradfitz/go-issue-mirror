	"body": "In CL 8998 your solution depends on moving the work that might never finish into its own goroutine, so that the goroutine running the test can still call t.Fatalf and exit. A plain t.Timeout API is not sufficient here because it would not capture the goroutine issue. One could imagine a more complex API like t.MustRunInTime(time.Duration, func()), but that could just as easily be provided by a helper library. It doesn't need to be in package testing. It's hard for me to see why this _must_ be in package testing. \n\n(In contrast, only package testing knows enough about the aggregate test execution to implement the timeout flag.)\n\nIf you want to continue with this, I would suggest resubmitting as a proposal. A design doc will probably be needed.",
