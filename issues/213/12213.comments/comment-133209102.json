(and stub out the stuff in releaselet.go that tries to do the godoc/tour stuff)\r\n\r\nYou will need a windows computer with all bits installed.\r\n\r\ngolang.org/x/build/env/windows/README describes the way Go builders are configured. You would only need appropriate bits of software installed - you can use \"winstrap\" program as described in README.\r\n\r\nAlex",
