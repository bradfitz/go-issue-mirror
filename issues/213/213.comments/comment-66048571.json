It certainly wouldn't help the example above since it'd\nthen just spin forever which is arguably worse than a fd shortage.  A fd shortage isn't\neven quite realistic nowadays.  I've done hundreds of thousands of fds in a single\nprocess on a moderate machine years ago.\n\nI feel that anybody who wants a timeout on a handler could wrap it in another Handler\nthat used a time.Timer to send an error to the client at least.  But in lieu of ways to\nkill fellow goroutines forcefully (which opens up a huge can of worms), I don't really\nsee anything to do here.\u003c/pre\u003e",
