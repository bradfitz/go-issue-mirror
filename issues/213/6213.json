A tag was announced for the\nmgo/bson package here:\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#\u003c/a\u003e!topic/golang-nuts/ZeP7PaXVDQo that\ntransparently stores data into a separate struct field denoted by \u0026quot;inline\u0026quot;\nduring an unmarshal and then merges that data back into the output during marshaling.\n\nI believe this would be a very useful feature to add into the encoding/json package and\ndoes not introduce any breaking changes in the Go 1.x series.\u003c/pre\u003e",
