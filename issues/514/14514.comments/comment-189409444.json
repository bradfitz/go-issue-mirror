On my machine that function returned 192 certs and does not appears to be including those ones from login or System. The returned certs seems to came from `/System/Library/Keychains/X509Anchors` as [documented](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Reference/certifkeytrustservices/#//apple_ref/c/func/SecTrustSetAnchorCertificates) by Apple and is not necessarily the same as what's inside `/System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain`.",
