	"body": "Currently Golang uses `security find-certificate` command to get a dump of everything that is inside `/System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain` which contains all system-wide root certificates. \r\n\r\nObviously we may simply run `security find-certificate` multiple times and grab certificates from all three (System Roots, System and login) chains but the last chain `login` does not actually require root privilege to modify and only applies to the user that is currently logged in.\r\n\r\nLook at what we are doing with Linux and BSD, in those OSes we have been importing certificates from only trusted locations (means you need root privilege to change them) we might want to include only `/Library/Keychains/System.keychain` but not `~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain` since the previous one needs root privilege to change and is not affected by SIP. \r\n\r\nJust my thought.",
