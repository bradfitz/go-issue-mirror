	"body": "Unless I've completely forgotten something, SWIG has always returned an interface value for a C++ class.  It's never returned a nil interface value for a NULL C++ pointer.  Changing that would certainly break existing code that uses SWIG.  Code that wants to test the returned C++ pointer for NULL is written as val.Swigcptr() == 0.  I think the code in misc/swig/stdio is just wrong.\r\n\r\nMore generally returning a nil interface value for a NULL C++ pointer would be a type confusion.  The value returned by SWIG is a typed C++ pointer.  The representation for that in Go is a typed interface that holds a nil pointer value, or, in this case, a zero value.  So again from a more general perspective I think that SWIG is right and the code in misc/swig/stdio is wrong.",
