Android version is 4.4.4.\r\n\r\nMmm, yes, they are both the x86 architecture. \r\nFirst one can run ARM app because of the Built-in ARM-translate; \r\nSecond one can run as well because of the support from \"Genymotion-ARM-Translation_v1.1\".\r\nThe \"x86\" maybe the important similar point between them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLost the \"libopenal.so\" file\r\n----\r\nThe reproduce step is simple:\r\n`go get golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile`\r\n`gomobile init`\r\ncmd.exe  -\u003e  \"cd /d\"  to the audio example directory,then:\r\n`gomobile bulid`\r\n \r\nI feel sorry that the network limit us to access the \"*.Google.com\".We have to modify the HOSTS file frequently or use vpn to access it .\r\nFew days ago, I unzip the apk file, and found no \"libopenal.so\" file.\r\nI forgot to check the files in \"GoPath\\pkg\\gomobile\\\" at that time.But I only compare the directory \"GoPath\" and found that the size is smaller, smaller than after \"Make computer can assess *.google.com again, then redo 'gomobile init -v'   \"\r\n\r\nI file a different bug with the quick reproduce steps,click the link here please:  https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12550\r\n\r\n--------\r\nThank you sincerely :)",
