Then, when build android , it seems that no include the \"libopenal.so\" file. \r\n\r\nCould you file a different bug with the steps to produce this case, please? It is a fatal case and must be fixed.\r\n\r\nCould you share details about your test device -- brand, model, Android version and similar? The audio package is currently tested only on ARM devices. As far as I can see, you have an x86 device with ARM emulation.\r\n\r\n/cc @crawshaw",
