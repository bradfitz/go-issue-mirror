The non-deterministically of the crash looks like there are other possible problems you have spotted.\r\n\r\nThe OpenAL loading strategy we use (https://github.com/golang/mobile/blob/master/exp/audio/al/al_android.go#L25), is looking under `/data/data/\u003cpkg\u003e/lib/libopenal.so` which doesn't seem to be canonical path to look for for your device.\r\n\r\nThe log above lists `/data/app-lib/com.miadzin.shmup-1/libX.so` (/data/app-lib/\u003cpkg\u003e-1/libname) as the location of the shared libraries. Can you list the libraries under /data/app-lib/org.golang.todo.audio using adb shell? It doesn't explain the no sound and libhoudini crashes, but I need to rule out other possible fatalities.\r\n\r\n(Note: OpenAL loading strategy we use is immature and not well tested across different devices, we should rather invoke System.loadLibrary through JNI or replicate its behavior.)",
