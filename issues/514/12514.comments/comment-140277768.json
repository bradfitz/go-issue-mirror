It is the key case crash?\r\n\r\nIt is the crash case. The audio might be buggy for looking under `/data/data/org.golang.todo.audio/lib/`. I will switch to System.loadLibrary rather than dlopen'ing myself with that particular path. If Android prefers to install the libraries somewhere else, the SDK should know where to load them from.\r\n\r\nI don't have much context why there is no sound in the arm-emulating device yet though.",
