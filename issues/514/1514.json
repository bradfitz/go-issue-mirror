	"title": "godoc: confusing error when searching for packages from the command line",
	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. on the command line type \u0026quot;godoc test\u0026quot;\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nAn error message saying that no such package was found\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nAn error message saying that no such command was found\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nAll\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nAll\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nf4bf4f146b1f+ tip\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nWhen invoked from the command line, the godoc program will first search the package\ndirectories for the supplied argument. If a package was not found godoc will treat the\nuser argument as a command instead of a package and search go/src/cmd. Unfortunately, if\nit doesn't find anything there either it will only report that it hasn't found the\ncommand, and will say nothing about the missing package error. This causes people new to\nthe language to exclaim \u0026quot;but i was looking for a package?!\u0026quot;\n\nNB: I hesitate to submit the attached patch as a CL as I'm not sure it is good enough.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1514/0/godoc.patch\"\u003egodoc.patch\u003c/a\u003e (1232 bytes)",
