	"body": "This is a bug with the old (and currently also the new) export format. Example by mdempsky:\r\n```\r\n$ cat a/a.go\r\npackage a\r\ntype A struct { _ int32 }\r\n\r\n$ cat b.go\r\npackage b\r\nimport \"./a\"\r\nvar x a.A = struct{ _ int32 }{}\r\n```\r\nCompiling b succeeds even though the (anonymous) struct in b has a _ (blank) field from a different package (b) then the struct x (package a). But per the spec, such an assignment is invalid because the blank fields are different (i.e., not unique): they are not exported yet from different packages.\r\n\r\nWe should probably just fix this with the new export format.",
