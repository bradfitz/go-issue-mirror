I wonder if they're often sending bad hints in their HTTP\nreplies, as they did earlier in this thread, saying they're going to do a keep-alive\nconnection but then killing it.\n\nI might have to sit on a connection for 10-20 milliseconds before re-using it, just to\nsee if the other side had a close on the way. Or maybe learn at runtime, per-hostname,\nwhich hosts lie about keep-alive ability. But I'd rather not.\u003c/pre\u003e",
