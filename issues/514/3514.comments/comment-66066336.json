In theory, every half-connection is closed\nwith a close-notify and any transport EOF without a close_notify is a truncation error.\nIn practice, things are very messy.\n\nHowever, I can well believe that we ignore close_notify. If treating it as EOF fixes\nthis problem then that sounds like a reasonable thing to do.\u003c/pre\u003e",
