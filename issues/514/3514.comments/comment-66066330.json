It stops using a TCP connection for HTTP (or HTTPS) once the remote side\nsays \"Connection: close\" (or HTTP/1.0 without Connection keep-alive), or once the reader\ngoroutine peeks a byte and it's EOF.\n\nThere might be two issues here:\n\n1) Amazon ELB is not sending a Connection: close on its 503 response?\n\n2) Peeking a byte on a tls.Conn should return EOF or something once it gets a\nclose_notify packet?  Or, if it already returns a different error, the net/http\nTransport code should learn what it is.  I see no vars declared in crypto/tls, though.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @bradfitz._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
