I just want to set expectations: even if we have a tls.Conn and/or\nhttp.Transport bug here and they get fixed, there will still be a race if you have a\nbusy client.\n\nBut that's likely true with any other language too. If you find that is NOT the case,\nI'd be curious what other libraries due to avoid this. Treating a 503 as a dead\nconnection always seems lame, for instance, if that's the answer.\u003c/pre\u003e",
