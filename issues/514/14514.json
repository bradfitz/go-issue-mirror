	"body": "1. Tested on `go version go1.6 darwin/amd64` and `go version go1.5.3 darwin/amd64`.\r\n2. OS X Yosemite, OS X El Capitan\r\n3. I attempted to connect to a TLS service with a certificate signed by an internal, enterprise certificate authority. The CA certificate was added to the System keychain.\r\n4. I expected to be able to connect to the TLS service without any issue as the certificate is signed by a CA I trust.\r\n5. The program failed to connect to the TLS service, because the CA certificate that issued the certificate is not installed in the SystemRootCertificates.keychain that Go loads trusted roots from.\r\n\r\nOn OS X Yosemite, this issue can be mitigated by installing the certificate into SystemRootCertificates.keychain via `/usr/bin/security` from the terminal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo security add-trusted-cert -k /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain \u003ccertificate\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, on El Capitan this is no longer possible without turning off security protections enabled by Apple.\r\n\r\n`execSecurityRoots` _should_ try to load additional certificates from the System keychain located at `/Library/Keychains/System.keychain`, and the Login keychain (`~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain`).\r\n\r\nThis bug makes distributing Go clients (especially 3rd-party developed) difficult in organizations with an internal PKI.",
