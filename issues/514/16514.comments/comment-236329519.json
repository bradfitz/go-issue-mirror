	"body": "\u003e I use AllowHTTP and DialTLS as indicated in the docs at https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/http2. The reason I configured them as they are is to disable TLS and use TCP. Are you saying this shouldn't work?\r\n\r\nThey're just lesser-used and thus lesser-tested. It's new code. Those code paths aren't used by the standard library in Go (via net/http) for instance. But it should work. I would just prioritize fixing it lower than something affecting the imminent Go 1.7 release, since x/net can be fixed after, but things included in Go 1.7 cannot easily.\r\n\r\n\u003e returns errRequestCanceled because of the request being cancelled, this is interpreted as a Roundtrip failure and seems to stop the TCP connection. \r\n\r\nYes, that's what RoundTrip shuld return. It is a failure to RoundTrip when there's a timeout.\r\n\r\nThe question is why it's closing the TCP connection. I suspect something's returning a ConnectionError(ErrCodeProtocol) or something. Can you run with GODEBUG=http2debug=2 (or http2debug=1 is probably sufficient) and see if the Go side tells you more?\r\n\r\n",
