That check has been lost in the\ntranslation to liblink. Make sure the check comes back.\n\nOne reasonable way is to check in the assembler, and to make the check easy the\nassembler could for DATA addresses for a given symbol to appear in increasing order,\nmaking the check O(1).\n\nOne way or another, though, this needs to be fixed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
