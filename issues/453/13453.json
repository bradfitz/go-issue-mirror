	"body": "- What version of Go are you using (go version)?\r\n\t- go1.5 (built using gvm \u0026 go1.4.2)\r\n- What operating system and processor architecture are you using?\r\n\t- osx 10.9.5, intel core i7, amd64\r\n- What did you do?\r\n\r\nI was trying to redirect `go get` to use the ssh address instead of the https address when cloning from a given address, as a proof-of-concept for use inside a company with a private repository host.\r\n\r\nI added lines to my  `~/.gitconfig` to redirect `git clone` to use ssh for github.com:\r\n\r\n\t[url \"git@github.com:\"]\r\n\t\tinsteadOf = https://github.com/\r\n\r\nPrior to this project I had been using a globally applied ssh `ControlPath` to persist and reuse ssh connections:\r\n\r\n\tHost *\r\n\t    ControlMaster auto\r\n\t    ControlPath ~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p\r\n\t    CompressionLevel 9\r\n\t    ControlPersist 2h\r\n\t    ServerAliveInterval 60\r\n\r\n_I verified that the `ControlPersist` setting is what leads to the unexpected behavior, but I don't understand why `go get` is effected._\r\n\r\n- What did you expect to see?\r\n\t- in a terminal I execute `go get` against any go repo\r\n\t- it downloads the source\r\n\t- my terminal is released when it finishes\r\n- What did you see instead?\r\n\t- I ran `go get`\r\n\t- the repository is cloned\r\n\t- my terminal remains busy\r\n- additional troubleshooting\r\n\r\nI tried with many repositories, and verified that when I disable `ControlPersist` in my `~/.ssh/config` my terminal is freed after the operation (as desired/expected), but then I no-longer have persisted ssh.\r\n\r\nIf I run `git clone` with `ControlPersist` enabled, everything works as expected, including my terminal being relinquished after it finishes cloning.\r\n\r\nIf I establish an ssh connection first (eg. `ControlPath` exists for a given host), then run `go get` with `ControlPersist` enabled, it works as expected.  So once the master connection is established it works fine.",
