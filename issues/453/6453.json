	"body": "by **Marko.Silokunnas**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eCurrent implementation of ipv4.Header doesn't have an easy way to set flags\nof the header. RFC791 defines that the flags field of the header is 3 bits \nwide and the fragment offset field is 13 bits wide. In the current implementation\nof ipv4.Header fragment offset is defined as an int and marshaled into a 16 bit \nwide field in Marshal(). This allows the flags to be set by manually using bitwise \noperations, but it is rather ugly. \n\nI propose that a Flags field should be added to ipv4.Header and the marshalling\nand unmarshalling functions should take care of the rest.\u003c/pre\u003e",
