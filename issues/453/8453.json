By default, it prefers IPv4 :(\n2. When using a net.Dialer{DualStack: true}, IPv4 and IPv6 SYNs are sent simultaneously,\nand the resulting address family is unpredictable.\n\nThe latter violates a \u0026quot;MUST\u0026quot; in the Happy Eyeballs RFC:\n\u003ca href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555#section-4.1\"\u003ehttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555#section-4.1\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThis is harmful for two reasons:\n- It increases server load in the common case, by always sending two SYNs.\n- Dual-stack clients cannot reliably use IPv6 to route around NATs.  The primary\nincentive for a network operator to deploy IPv6 is to reduce NAT load (and therefore\nsave money), but this sort of client behavior invalidates that incentive.\u003c/pre\u003e",
