	"body": "I use `ControlMaster` as a means of boosting ssh performance by reusing/multiplexing on a single established connection.  _It also deals with connection rate limiting._\r\n\r\nI would much rather see a fix to how `go get` handles stderr than an override to a perfectly valid ssh configuration.  The fact that `git clone` works fine alone clearly shows the problem is with how `go get` is dealing with its subprocess.\r\n\r\nIf the objective of `go get` is to suppress errors from `git clone` why not just use `io.Discard` as the stderr, or a `bytes.Buffer` to collect the output and decide whether to relay it to the tty after execution?",
