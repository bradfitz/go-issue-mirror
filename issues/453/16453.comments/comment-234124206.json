	"body": "By the way, it's rather unlikely that an extended timeout for `TestCgoExternalThreadSIgnal` will help.  The program in question should crash immediately.  If it doesn't crash immediately, it should exit in five seconds.  The fact that the test hangs for a full minute means that something has gone wrong with the exiting process somehow.  I very much doubt that extending the timeout is going to help.",
