It looks like go-sqlite should update *SQLiteRows.nc after an alter statement, which should return a new len(Column()) size.\r\n\r\nWhile I could be mistaken here, it isn't the sql package caching something (the cache happens on the first Next()), it is the sqlite package that isn't returning the correct column number.\r\n",
