	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCurrently the ReverseProxy type preserves the Host header from the original request,\nwhich can cause problems with Vhosts and in my experience particularly when proxying to\nan HTTPS server using SNI.\n\nApache's mod_proxy provides an option to preserve the Host header and it defaults to Off\n(the opposite of ReverseProxy's behaviour):\n\u003ca href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypreservehost\"\u003ehttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypreservehost\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIn section 14.23 of RFC2616 it says: \u0026quot;An HTTP/1.1 proxy MUST ensure that any\nrequest message it forwards does contain an appropriate Host header field that\nidentifies the service being requested by the proxy\u0026quot; which I understand as setting\nthe Host header to the target host and not what was originally requested.\n\nI think ReverseProxy should rewrite the Host field appropriately, if not by default then\nperhaps enabled by a boolean field.\u003c/pre\u003e",
