Multicast messages can be\ndelivered to multiple clients listening for packets on that UDP address/port\ncombination. With SO_REUSEADDR set, the OS will deliver to all of them. With\nSO_REUSEADDR set on unicast UDP sockets, the OS will deliver to only one of the\nlistening sockets (and in my experience, it will deliver to the last socket bound to\nthat address/port, though I don't know how this is across OSes or if it has changed).\n\nIt is valid to want to turn off SO_REUSEADDR in both TCP and UDP, and there's no reason\nwe shouldn't export *netFD.setReuseAddr via TCPConn and UDPConn.
