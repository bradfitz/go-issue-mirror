But I feel it's okay because apps \nwork well even if we take some risks and advances on socket \ndescriptor table search by using SO_REUSE(ADDR|PORT) options.\nAs you know the socket consists of 5-tuple, a five is enough \nto avoid end-to-end identification confusion under current \nIP networking environment.\n\nThe latter seems like a bug that kinda fate-sharing on socket \ndescriptor. I just uploaded a patch to fix this, confirmed on \ndarwin, freebsd and linux with the program in comment #0.\n\nPlease take a look at \u0026lt;\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/5239041/\u0026gt\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/5239041/\u0026gt\u003c/a\u003e;\u003c/pre\u003e",
