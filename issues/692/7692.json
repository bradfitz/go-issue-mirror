	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThis is feature request, not a bug.\n\nBy adonovan:\n\n\u0026quot;Assignable(tuple, tuple) should probably implement element-wise assignability\nsince that's the effective semantics when you return a multi-valued expression or\nvalue,ok expression.    It comes up in my refactoring tool, I want to ask: can I assign\nthis expr (multi-valued) to this Signature.Result()?  It would be convenient if it\nworked for tuples.  Not a big deal though.\u0026quot;\n\n(personal e-mail from 4/1/2014)\n\n(This may be useful to do, especially if it would simplify checking of return\nstatements, etc. and cases where the lhs is multi-valued, and the rhs is a (single)\ntuple).\u003c/pre\u003e",
