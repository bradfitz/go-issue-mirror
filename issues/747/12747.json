	"body": "Regarding the following PR:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/playground/commit/64f7014affabd5446cabfe7b9e362502c77caa06#commitcomment-13430374\r\n\r\nChange Id: I6a9f012346cb332deaba8eae4375040a00e08e57\r\n\r\nIt was said to hide and block share functionality from specific countries, to serve *.golang.org to Chinese users.\r\n\r\nHowever, Hong Kong (HK) is included as one of the X-AppEngine-Country to disable the functionality, while it is NOT behind the GFW and have a different legal system.\r\n\r\nThis would be annoying for HongKong residents, so my question is why is HK included? Shall it be removed? (And since Macau is not included so I suppose this is a mistake?)",
