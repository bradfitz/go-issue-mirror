	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eEven with ContinueOnError, some messages are always printed to os.Stderr. This means\nthat it's not possible to collect the error messages when flag is used to parse options\nfrom the other side of a network connection, for example; neither is it possible to\nsuppress all output to run a script quietly.\n\nOne backwardly compatible solution would be to add an output io.Writer\ninside FlagSet and use os.Stderr if that's nil.\n\nAs a nice side effect, this could remove the spurious print when flag is tested.\n\n354b17404643 weekly/weekly.2012-01-15\u003c/pre\u003e",
