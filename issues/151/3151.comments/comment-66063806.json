It (finally!)\ndisentangles the type name from properties of the type.\n\nAs a result another inconsistency in the spec disappears: In a type declaration, a name\nis bound to a type. That type, if it had any anonymous fields with methods embedded but\nwere standing alone (not in a declaration), would not have any methods. Standing with\nthe type declaration, that type all of sudden does not lose its methods: i.e., type and\ntype name are not orthogonal.\u003c/pre\u003e",
