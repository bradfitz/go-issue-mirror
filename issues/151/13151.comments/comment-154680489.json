So, when I change it to `c:\\dev\\go`, the test works fine.\r\nIt was not obvious for me: despite the fact, that the sources are identical, changing GOROOT makes the tests pass.\r\nWith GOROOT set to `c:\\go` some test pass, others don't. For instance, \r\n`reflect, strconv, regexp` - pass\r\n`signal, bufio` - fail\r\nIt is, likely,  not an issue at all.\r\nThanks.\r\n",
