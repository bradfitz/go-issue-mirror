That won't work directly with\nnetchan since channels can't be serialised by gob. I'm using the trick of an exporter\ncreating and exporting new channels to talk to new clients, and sending the client their\nnames to import. When the client closes sending channels, the exporter stops using these\nchannels.\n\nOver time this will cause a memory leak in exported channels. An unexport method is\nneeded on the exporter side to clean up no longer usable closed channels.\u003c/pre\u003e",
