	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eFramer allocates a new buffer on every ReadFrame. This is very expensive when reading in\nlarge files. This lack of memory management also makes implementing flow control\ndifficult. If endpoint A sets the stream window to 1 megabyte and endpoint B writes a\nframe with size 2 megabyte, we're forced to read in the 2 megabyte frame, meaning we\ncan't do either of error handling options presented in the spec.\n\nA possibility is to have a method on framer that lets us set the buffer to be used on\ndata frames. However, we would have to handle partial frame reads then.\u003c/pre\u003e",
