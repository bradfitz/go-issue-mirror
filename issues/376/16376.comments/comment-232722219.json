I guess we could teach the hook to look for the line:\r\n\r\n`# −−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−− \u003e8 −−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−`\r\n\r\nand cut everything after it.\r\n\r\nMaybe there's a better way, but at first glance, I don't really see how hooks are intended to interact with commit --verbose other than by manually reproducing git's behavior.\r\n\r\n",
