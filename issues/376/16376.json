What did you do?\r\n\r\nFollow https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html to send my first CL.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n`commit-msg` would work as expected, adding `Change-Id` and leaving the rest.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nFirst, the `commit-msg` hook got confused by this in my `.gitconfig`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[commit]\r\n       verbose = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a new option (since 2.9) that spits out the diff at the bottom of the commit message file in every commit that git does. Useful to see what you're committing. The hook, though, included this diff in the final commit message instead of ignoring it. Note that the diff isn't commented out, but it's after the `# Everything below will be removed.` line.\r\n\r\nOnce I removed the option from my `.gitconfig`, that got fixed. But then the `Change-Id` would still not appear.\r\n\r\nI had to follow the `git codereview mail` instructions, which did give me a hook that actually worked:\r\n\r\n```\r\nremote: ERROR: [8a50cc8] missing Change-Id in commit message footer\r\nremote:\r\nremote: Hint: To automatically insert Change-Id, install the hook:\r\nremote: curl -Lo `git rev-parse --git-dir`/hooks/commit-msg https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/tools/hooks/commit-msg ; chmod +x `git rev-parse --git-dir`/hooks/commit-msg\r\n```",
