This issue is about framing at the TLS level -- a poor choice of TLS-level framing can force a slow client to download large TLS records, which increases time-to-first-decrypted-byte. We can't solve this issue at the TCP level because TCP has no visibility into TLS record boundaries, so TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT won't help. I'm not familiar with CoDeL, but it also looks too low-level to solve this issue.",
