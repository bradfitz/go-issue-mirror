	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eOne of the things changing in Go 1.1 is the size of int, necessitating updates of all\nthe assembly functions that have unsized ints as arguments or results. \n\ncode.google.com/p/rsc/cmd/asmlint is the tool I wrote to read Go forward declaration and\nscan assembly listings for incorrect offsets or type mismatches. This is what I used to\nupdate the Go tree when we made the change.\n\nNow that cmd/vet knows about build.Packages, it should be straightforward to drop this\ncode into a new vet module and have it emit errors. The asmlint command also has a\n\u0026quot;fix everything\u0026quot; mode, but we could drop or disable that for integration with\nvet. I think it suffices to report the errors.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/rsc/source/browse/cmd/asmlint/main.go\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/rsc/source/browse/cmd/asmlint/main.go\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
