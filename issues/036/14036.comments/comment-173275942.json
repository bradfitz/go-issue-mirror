But \"response.Body\" is fully evaluated before DumpResponse:\r\n\r\nExample for you to play with: http://play.golang.org/p/AE6mwTOV6j\r\n\r\nMaybe you meant http://play.golang.org/p/YIOKnNMT-N ?\r\n\r\nIn any case, this seems like fine behavior. If httputil.DumpResponse returns an error after consuming the body, it seems valid to assume that res.Body is messed up. And code like my first link is much more common than code like my second link.\r\n",
