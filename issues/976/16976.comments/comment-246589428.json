In that case, we definitely don't want\nthe\nother code to extend the cap, as it will step on later allocations.)\n\n2. if you're talking about only extending into free space not used by any\nother\nobjects, my last reply explained why it's not a good idea both\nimplementation\nwise (will complicate gc bitmap to track object at byte granularity) and\nefficiency\nwise (if two goroutines try to expend the same slice, contention results).\n",
