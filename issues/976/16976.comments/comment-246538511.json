	"body": "If len==cap, the maximum amount available is cap, not whatever is in the underlying array. Ignoring cap in this case during append would eliminate the semantics of the x[i:j:k] slice operation, which was added for a reason. I agree with Keith that it would be nice if make([]T, n) could return cap\u003en to begin with, but it cannot today. \r\n\r\nIf exposing the underlying array size returned by make is important, then instead of overloading append, a better way would be to adjust the calls to make to ask for it explicitly, not try to reconstruct it later. For example, a make-with-maximal-cap syntax might be make([]T, n, _) or make([]T, n, ...).",
