And it's not all VMs.\r\n\r\nWe probably should have per-builder lists of tests to skip or something.\r\nOr just make the runtime itself detect things going backwards and set a\r\nflag we can check here. e.g.:\r\n\r\n   func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {\r\n        if err := testFoo(t); err != nil { \r\n            if runtime.TimerEverWentBackwards() {\r\n               t.Skip(\"test failed, but ignoring, since runtime reports timer sucks on this machine\")\r\n            } else {\r\n              t.Fatal(err)\r\n            }\r\n     }\r\n\r\nObviously not exactly like that, but I'm wondering if we can ask the runtime if\r\nit ever detected a problem with the clocks, if the clocks aren't fixable.\r\n\r\nThen we can also make \"go test -trace\" and friends print a nicer message saying, \r\n\r\n    \"Sorry, tracing is not supported in this environment. Your clocks don't work.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
