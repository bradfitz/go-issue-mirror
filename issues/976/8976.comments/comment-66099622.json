The different cores increment their\ncounters independently, and are only periodically synchronized.  My understanding is\nthat the Linux kernel has some moderately complex code to ensure that RDTSC always give\nmonotonically increasing results even when called from different cores.  Presumably the\nSolaris kernel does not have that code.\u003c/pre\u003e",
