What this means is that one of the tests called t.Error or t.Fatal some time *after* the Test function had returned.\r\n\r\nPrior to Go 1.7, the testing package would silently ignore this situation, but in Go1.7 it would now complain loudly when this happened.\r\n\r\nIf this is not the case, feel free to re-open this issue!",
