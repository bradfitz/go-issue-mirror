	"body": "What you are seeing is that the output is buffered and printed as a block except in the special case of \"go test\" with no arguments.\nThe reason to do this is to separate the output from multiple tests. The reason not to include len(args) == 1 is that if you use a wildcard that resolves to 1 thing, that behavior needs to be the same as resolving to 2 things. At this point I think all these decisions are not likely to change.\n\nIf you care deeply about stdout vs stderr you can use 'go test -c \u0026\u0026 ./foo.test'.",
