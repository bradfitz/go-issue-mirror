Or probably I didn't get your point.\r\n\r\n3) It's currently not consistent in that methods without return values don't require a return statement at the end. Imo it would be consistent if *no* return statement would be needed. Return is a control statement, but at the very end of the function it doesn't serve this purpose in any way.\r\n\r\nBTW, this change would be 100% backwards-compatible.",
