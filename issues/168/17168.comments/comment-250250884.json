	"body": "My understanding is that `uaddr1` was ignored completely in revisions prior to [231989](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision\u0026revision=231989), going back at least to release 8.0.0 (the oldest I checked).\r\n\r\n[231989](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision\u0026revision=231989) was followed 3 days later by [232144](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision\u0026revision=232144), but the semantics of `uaddr1` between those revisions does differ, and I'm not certain which versions of FreeBSD, if any, contain [231989](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision\u0026revision=231989).\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, any version cut from a RELEASE branch will either ignore `uaddr1` or treat is as a `size_t` (I'll double check this).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe this would be a breaking change for any system running an old STABLE or CURRENT cut after [231989](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision\u0026revision=231989) but before [232144](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision\u0026revision=232144). I don't know enough about FreeBSD releases to know whether any such releases actually exists.",
