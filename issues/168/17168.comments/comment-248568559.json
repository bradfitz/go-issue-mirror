Can you run your snippet with GOTRACEBACK=all, twiddle the running system clock, and then send SIGABRT to the process? Hope it generates useful information for debugging.\r\n```\r\ngo build sample.go\r\n\r\nexport GOTRACEBACK=all\r\n./sample\r\n\r\n\u003ctwiddle system clock\u003e\r\n\r\npkill -f sample\r\n```",
