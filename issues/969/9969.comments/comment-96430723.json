My biggest complaint with templates thus far is that they are hard to make human-readable without sacrificing the quality of the output.\r\n\r\nThat said, I suspect that there may be a lot of unique cases. Eg in my case I only wanted to trim newlines, so I used the following:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nleading := regexp.MustCompile(\"(\\n)*[{]{2}[-][ ]*\")\r\ntempBytes = leading.ReplaceAll(tempBytes, []byte(\"{{\"))\r\ntrailing := regexp.MustCompile(\"[ ]*[-][}]{2}(\\n)*\")\r\ntempBytes = trailing.ReplaceAll(tempBytes, []byte(\"}}\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you do address this, it would be nice to have a little flexibility but I don't really know how far you can go without it snowballing into too much.",
