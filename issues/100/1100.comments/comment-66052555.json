I changed the questions to ask for the compiler name and operating system.\n\nThanks for these reports.  It would help if you could send programs\nthat use package main and define a main function, so they are easier to run.\n\nThis is actually working as intended.  It's a subtle thing,\nbut runtime.Callers returns the return PCs going up the\nstack.  The return PCs are the PCs of the instruction that\nthe call returns to, not the call itself.  The code that formats\nthe traceback for a crash subtracts 1 from each PC before\ntranslating it to a line number.  The equivalent change\nin your code would be to call f.FileLine(pc - 1).\n\nruntime.Callers could lie and do the subtraction, but\nthis is pretty subtle already and I think it's clearer for\nall involved to hand out the raw data and let clients\nadjust.  Otherwise the clients who want the return PCs\nhave to add 1, and then if that changes they're all broken,\nand so on and so on.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
