All public APIs need to consider both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nYou propose many solutions, but I'd like to get a clear statement of the problem first. Even the title of this bug seems like a description of a lack of solution, rather than a problem that's not solvable.\r\n\r\nI agree that the WriteTimeout is ill-specified. See also my comment about ReadTimeout here: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16958#issuecomment-244239789\r\n\r\nYou allude to your original problem here:\r\n\r\n\u003e So servers with any streaming endpoints are forced not to implement timeouts at all on the entire Server.\r\n\r\nSo you have an infinite stream, and you want to forcibly abort that stream if the user isn't reading fast enough? In HTTP/1, that means closing the TCP connection. In HTTP/2, that means sending a RST_STREAM.\r\n\r\nI guess we need to define WriteTimeout before we make progress on this bug.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think WriteTimeout should mean?\r\n",
