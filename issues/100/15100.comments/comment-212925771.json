This makes the display server \"remote\" wrt the shiny program.\r\n\r\nAFAIK this won't work, x11driver uses MIT-SHM to upload the image and MIT-SHM doesn't work without, you know, actual \"shared memory\" between the client and the display server.\r\n\r\nxgbutil and xgb examples work because they are using server side pixmaps (or whatever they are called, I'm not an expert). I guess it wouldn't be too much work to add PutImage as a fallback for uploading but remember that we're all getting waylanded soon and once we are in wayland-land there's no way remote display servers work.",
