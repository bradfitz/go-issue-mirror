	"body": "Intuitively, I see filepath.Join as giving the path you would get if you did a Chdir to each path in sequence (without looking at the filesystem, so you could end up with a relative path). On Windows if I Chdir(\"c:\") and then Chdir(\"abc\") I end up in the same place as if I did Chdir(\"c:abc\"). This is different from Chdir(\"c:\\\\\\\\abc\") because on Windows you have a working directory for each drive letter.\r\n\r\nI don't have any valid intuition about the current behavior. It strikes me as just a symbol manipulation that makes Unix-specific assumptions even though filepath is supposed to be a cross platform module.\r\n\r\nAlthough it could break existing code, I suspect any such existing code is already buggy, and this change would make it less buggy.",
