	"body": "@thanm If you strictly interpret the Go spec, then printing 4 like gccgo does is technically correct.  But part of the discussion on #15550 is that the Go spec's wording is incorrect, because it doesn't consider that const declarations can be nested.\r\n\r\nThat said, it might be appropriate to close this issue for now, and re-classify #15550 as an issue against the Go spec.  Then we can reopen issues for the compilers as appropriate based on the conclusion.",
