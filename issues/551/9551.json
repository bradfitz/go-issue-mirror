	"body": "As we are discussing OpenAL bindings on a separate thread (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9328), @crawshaw suggests we should also examine a non-3D audio API.\r\n\r\nMost of our developers seem to initially require a high-level audio package that does the basics. The feature set should include playing, pausing, stopping, meter control (volume) and multiple channel support that will allow the users to mix multiple sources.\r\n\r\nI'm planning to take AV Foundation Framework and Android's MediaPlayer as a basis to the surface layer, but we're likely to depend on lower-level APIs in implementation. Some of the main problems I've so far seen in order to motivate me to work with lower APIs are:\r\n- AVPlayer doesn't provide APIs to feed streaming data unless the source is an HTTP Live Streaming source.\r\n- Android's MediaPlayer used to have some latency problems, would not be the best fit to play audio effects.\r\n- On Linux desktop, we're likely to depend on PulseAudio which already only provides low-level APIs. We anyways have to build higher-level controllers.\r\n\r\nAnother questions is whether we're thinking about a codec API or not. If not, the audio package will work only with PCM sources.",
