There\ndoesn't seem to be any particular pattern to it; the program is something that runs in\nthe background and repeatedly does the scanning in question, and it'll fail \u0026quot;after\na while\u0026quot;.\n\nI haven't seen this myself or received any reports of it on non-Android non-ARM systems,\nfor whatever that's worth.\n\nSorry for the extreme vagueness. :(\u003c/pre\u003e",
