	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIn building an HTTP proxy I found that when I aggressively time out the backend requests\nand have many client connections, I often get HTTP protocol errors and incorrect\nresponses.\n\nThis is reproducible using httputil.ReverseProxy as well. The code at\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/ZQDr5M2NRx\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/ZQDr5M2NRx\u003c/a\u003e starts a simple server and proxy, and then uses 50\nconcurrent clients to make requests through the proxy. The server sleeps for 30ms before\nresponding and the proxy times the backend request out after 35ms, so many of the\nrequests cannot be handled in time.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n1. Run the code at \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/ZQDr5M2NRx\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/ZQDr5M2NRx\u003c/a\u003e on your local computer\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nBesides the initial logging messages, the only error output I would expect are messages\nlike this:\n\n    http: proxy error: net/http: timeout awaiting response headers\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nIn addition to many timeout errors, I get messages like this:\n\n    Unsolicited response received on idle HTTP channel starting with \u0026quot;H\u0026quot;; err=\u0026lt;nil\u0026gt;\n\nand like this:\n\n    Client: expected \u0026quot;hello\u0026quot;, got: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n\nThat second error messages is one I'm printing out when the client makes what is\napparently a successful request to the proxy but gets back something other than\n\u0026quot;hello\u0026quot;, which is what the server is responding with.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nTested on darwin/amd64 and linux/amd64\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo 1.2\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThis came up in a similar context to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/6995\"\u003eissue #6995\u003c/a\u003e. The race detector didn't find any\nissues in this code for me, though.\u003c/pre\u003e",
