Git, Mercurial and Subversion do function similarly in a sense that one clones/checkouts repo in a certain dir and that's it.\r\n\r\nOtoh, with Fossil the situation a bit different and it requires 2 steps:\r\n\r\n``` \r\nfossil clone URL repo.fossil \r\nfossil open repo,fossil (in some dir)\r\n```\r\n\r\niow., the repo itself is fully contained in a single repo.fossil file which is actually Sqlite3 database, while checkout and/or working directoriy are in a another dir which is 'connected' with the repo file itself.\r\n\r\nAny thought?",
