	"body": "I've started working on this, but there are two issues that are holding me up:\r\n\r\n- The diff between x/tools/go/vcs and cmd/go/vcs prohibit fossil from being added to the x/ version.  At some point a `chdir` internal flag was added, and fossil required a similar internal flag.  I had to add a `mkdir` internal flag.\r\n\r\n- The other is related to #10322, because fossil uses a single file.  All the IsDir() checks had to be handled as a special case for fossil, or removed.  If those checks are removed for all VCS, this change will be slightly easier.",
