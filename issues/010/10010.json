	"body": "Fossil (http://fossil-scm.org) is very nice version control system which, imho, is designed very much in the spirit of Go langauge itself being very powerful, but still much more **simple** to use in comparison with e.g. Git. Moreover, it does things a little bit different - e.g. keeping the whole repo in *single* (sqlite3 database) file and not in flat database like e.g. '.git' and is very simple to handle repositories and it includes wiki, tickets system etc...we can sayn 'github in a box'. :-)\r\n\r\nHowever, some things are done differently and Fossil therefore requires two steps to clone and checkout the repo:\r\n\r\n1. fossil clone someURL repo.fossil\r\n\r\n2. fossil open repo.fossil\r\n\r\nHowever,  I consider that it would be very nice feature for Golang's ecosystem to have official support for working with Fossil DVCS which is very attractive to users preferring to have simple \u0026 powerful tool deliberately leaving out some features in order to keep things simple.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nGour\r\n",
