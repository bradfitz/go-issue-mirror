If it's\nnot *TestTableKey, then it doesn't looks like Unmarshaler is being implemented.\n\nThis code at the top of decoder.indirect() doesn't think the interface is implemented:\n\n    var isUnmarshaler bool                             \n    if v.Type().NumMethod() \u003e 0 {                      \n      // Remember that this is an unmarshaler,         \n      // but wait to return it until after allocating  \n      // the pointer (if necessary).                   \n      _, isUnmarshaler = v.Interface().(Unmarshaler)   \n    }                                                  \n\n\nWhat is the right solution here? I feel like some error condition should be raised, or\nperhaps that the value passed to Unmarshal() should only be a pointer.\u003c/pre\u003e",
