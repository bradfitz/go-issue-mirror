I'll open yet another BOM issue.\nBut the fact is, BOMs are illegal in the middle of Go files. That is what the compilers\nimplement. You can argue that that should not be the case, and you can argue that it's\nnot well documented, but that's the language as it is today.\n\nThe linking issue here, though, that's a problem that should be fixed, although it won't\nbe until after Go 1.1.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-soon**, removed **priority-triage**._",
