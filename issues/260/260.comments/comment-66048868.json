This doesn't seem too difficult, but I'm not sure how that would\nwork specifically on Darwin, since we just use semaphores to sleep.\n\nIt's also worth noting that all OS sleep routines typically state that they are\nguaranteed to sleep for `at least' the specified time. I don't disagree that if one\nshould be able to sleep for 5ms, it should be supported. However, the sleep routines\nare typically not real-time and do not make real-time guarantees.\n\n--dho\u003c/pre\u003e",
