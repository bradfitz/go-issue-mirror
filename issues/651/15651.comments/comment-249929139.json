The tip importer is backward-compatible and can read older formats. But @alandonovan is also correct that an older importer won't be able to read a newer format. This is an issue for infrastructure that cannot move to the latest release yet must process (for some reason or another) object files and export data built with the latest compiler (as is the case for source code analysis tools).",
