The Windows 7 box got stuck at\nTestStreamingGet.  I also updated to tip (hg id a3a707ba21f5) and tested the Windows 7\nbox again and it still gets stuck on TestStreamingGet (windows-386 again).\n\nBefore \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/2616\"\u003eissue #2616\u003c/a\u003e was fixed I had tried the normal windows trouble shooting steps,\nupdate drivers, use an admin account, disable anti-virus and firewall, and probably some\nstuff I forgot and every time I got stuck at TestStreamingGet.\u003c/pre\u003e",
