	"body": "As for the Listener interface, I think I understand what you're saying - I need to create my own type with an Accept and Close method, etc, and do my magic at that layer which I then pass along.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the x509 stuff, does that mean that LoadX509KeyPair is not expecting just a key and server cert pair, but rather the private key and the complete bundle of all intermediate certificates as well as the server certificate?\r\n\r\nMy experience with TLS has all been in node.js, which is extremely explicit about how to load certificates - private, cert, and chain are always explicitly declared as such, not bundled - and haproxy, which is extremely lax - bundle the files any which way as long as no true root (self-signed) cas are included.\r\n\r\nGo's conventions are different from either of theirs so I'm being humbled quite a bit to realize that I don't know these things as well as I thought.\r\n\r\nI'll have to play around with this on Monday, but I think you've helped me understand both some of the idiomaticies of go that were eluding me and some implementation details that I had the wrong understanding of.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.",
