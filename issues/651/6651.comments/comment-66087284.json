Wouldn't you\nneed to know if Query() succeeded before attempting to fetch result records?\n\u003e No, that's my point exactly.  Consider the following query:\n\nOops, misread that.  The point is that Query() succeeding does not guarantee that all\ncalls to Next() on the result will succeed.  Even without the scenario I described\nabove, what if the first row sent from the database does not conform to the protocol? \nWhat if it has garbage data in it?\n\nTo guarantee that Next() never returns an error (other than io.EOF) you would have to\nfetch all the rows from the cursor, materialize them in the driver and check that the\ndata is as expected.  Which is a completely silly requirement to impose on all the\ndrivers just because QueryRow() ignores errors.\u003c/pre\u003e",
