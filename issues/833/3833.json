	"body": "by **iJonCarroll**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1.see \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org./p/SEMHqPEOJD\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org./p/SEMHqPEOJD\u003c/a\u003e\n2.run, and enter \u0026quot;abc def ghi\u0026quot; or similar in a single line, press return\n3.observe the output, note that the first rune of second and third words are missing\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\u0026quot;abc\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;def\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;ghi\u0026quot;\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\u0026quot;abc\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;ef\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;hi\u0026quot;\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g (I assume - standard windows distribution on x86 32bit)\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows XP SP3\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo1.0.2\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nNote - Have read \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Scanning\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Scanning\u003c/a\u003e \u0026quot;Note: Fscan etc. can read one\ncharacter.. [..] .. If the reader also implements UnreadRune, that method will be used\nto save the character and successive calls will not lose data.\u0026quot; \n\nMy interpretation was that the use of \u0026quot;UnreadRune\u0026quot; was automatic, (built into\nthe pkg), and would apply to \u0026quot;Fscanln\u0026quot; as well as \u0026quot;Fscan\u0026quot;.\n\nTruncating behaviour also observed with Scanln.\n\nAs far as I can tell \u0026quot;fmt.Fscan\u0026quot; works without an explicit\n\u0026quot;UnreadRune\u0026quot; with no truncation\n\nDesired behaviour is got if \u0026quot;source.UnreadRune()\u0026quot; is un-commented in the\nsupplied program - but I was not expecting to have to use it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
