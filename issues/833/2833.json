	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe idea is to make the test directory run with\n\ncd test\ngo run run.go\n\nIf you are testing a possibly buggy compiler, you\nback up to somewhere you trust and go build run.go\nand copy the executable into your buggy world\ninstead of using 'go run'.\n\nEliminates the bash script.  Should also eliminate\nthe Perl errchk script.\n\nThe comments at the top of the file might be \nsimplified too.  Ian may have good ideas about\nthis since he has to handle them specially in\ngccgo already.\u003c/pre\u003e",
