And the\ncompressed contents are not readable by python's zlib, nor by go's zlib. And I'm pretty\nsure someone else checked it against a simple C zlib program, and also found that it was\nnot compatible.\n\nSo I'm quite confident that there is a bug in zlib.NewWriter, but whether the bug is\nstrictly in the flate writer, I don't know.\u003c/pre\u003e",
