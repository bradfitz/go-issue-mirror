	"body": "@ianlancetaylor Hmm, that's a pretty significant API surface increase, for a type that already has a bunch of methods. Especially if you also want to offer Round varieties.\r\n\r\nWe could do something like t.TruncateTo().Hour() to hide everything under another type, though maybe that's just synctatic sugar.
