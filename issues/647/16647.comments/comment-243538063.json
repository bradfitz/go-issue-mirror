I think the docs should at least be improved to more explicitly state that Truncate does not work for time.Hour, and to remove the example. Do we want to actually change Truncate to behave as you propose? Or provide a new version of Truncate?\r\n\r\nIn general I'm concerned that, like many things related to times, truncating is subtle and easy to get wrong - as evidenced by how long it took this thread to reach a working function. Thus I would prefer if the standard library already had the right subtle behavior built-in.",
