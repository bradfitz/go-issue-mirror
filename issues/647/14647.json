	"body": "The Parent of an Object representing an interface method or struct field is nil, which is a surprise: you might expect its parent to be the enclosing file or local scope that defines the environment in which the object's declaration is resolved.  It is also undocumented.\r\n\r\nGiven that nothing was specified, I would not be averse to changing the behavior, though it would certainly cause some existing programs to break and may violate the spirit of the compatibility rules.\r\n\r\nIn any case we should clearly document the behavior.\r\n",
