	"body": "Now that the runtime is written in Go, it's worth taking the time to consider whether it could be better organized if it were split into packages. I think it could. Splitting the runtime into packages could also help improve the readability, in the style sense, of the code. That would make the runtime more accessible to new contributors.\r\n\r\nIt was also suggested by crawshaw that putting certain parts of the runtime into their own packages would make it easier to stub out or replace parts of the runtime. That would be helpful when bootstrapping a new architecture or os, where all of the runtime is not available, or in creating a modified runtime that would run without an os.",
