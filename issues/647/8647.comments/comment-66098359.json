I'm still trying to find a\nreliable image building system we can use.\n\nMy next bet to get a vexpress arm ubuntu image is following this guide:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Dev/QemuARMVexpress\"\u003ehttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Dev/QemuARMVexpress\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nThe problem with this is that docker build can't mount loop devices (only run\n--privileged) and I haven't yet tested qemu user mode emulation inside docker which does\nsomething to install itself into the system elf execution.\n\nMaybe building the arm image base to the point it can run ssh may need to be a different\nscript (possibly with vagrant vm if docker can't do it well enough.).\nThe output of this script is a kernel + initrd + ext filesystem, which can be saved and\nthe docker file consumes it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
