	"body": "The example for time.Time.Truncate suggests truncating by time.Hour, but in fact Truncate does not do what the user probably wants if the timezone is not hour-aligned.\r\n\r\ne.g. https://play.golang.org/p/hAfBrYWNeZ\r\n\r\nI suggest just removing the time.Hour example, and possibly explicitly suggest that Truncate cannot be used for times \u003e= time.Hour because of timezones.\r\n\r\nI doubt we can actually change the implementation of Truncate at this point, so I've marked this a Documentation bug.",
