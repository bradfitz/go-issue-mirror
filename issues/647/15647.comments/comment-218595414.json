HTTP/1.1 requests are fine (which are implicitly keep-alive), and it's also fine (even with HTTP/1.1+keep-alive) if the server sets a Content-Length of \"0\" (which is then scrubbed in the response).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how you're able to reproduce this with a browser, though, since I know of no browsers which still send HTTP/1.0 requests.\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/15647#issuecomment-218594163\u003e\r\n",
