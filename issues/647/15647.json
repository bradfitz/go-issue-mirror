	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n1.5\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nlinux / osx\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nLoad test http server with requests using keep-alive, return 204 (no content) codes. For example:\r\nab  -n 1000000 -c 100 \"http://yourserver/andendpoint\"\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nLow number of connections in use as they should be reused after each completed request..\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nRan out of connections quickly. You can watch the count like so:\r\nsudo netstat -tnop | grep \":81\" | wc -l\r\n\r\nI have a \"fix\". Just set content-length to 0 in the header. The thing is that a 204 has no content so specifying this value seems implicit.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
