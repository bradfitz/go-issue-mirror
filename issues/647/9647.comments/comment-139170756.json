If \"/\" is rejected, should we also reject \"\"? What about absolute paths? As it is, any proper user of tar should be sanitizing the paths read out anyways.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I can imagine a possible use case of \"/\" where it is encoded into an archive to preserve uid, gid, or something similar.",
