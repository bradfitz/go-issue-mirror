I think the Setctty\noption might not be what I thought it was.  The only uses I can see are for processes\nthat detach from the current session to become their own session leaders and then open a\nnew tty afterward (i.e. login or screen).  I don't think calling it with fd == 0 will\nwork and I think it would require setsid before it.\n\nMaybe you can ask the original programmer why this option was put there and if there is\na working example of its use.\n\nIn any case, I don't think this option (even if it works) will do what I want it to do. \nI'm not sure if there is a way to keep a child process in the foreground after the\nparent exits in bash.\u003c/pre\u003e",
