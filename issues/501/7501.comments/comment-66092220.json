Arrays and structs are zero if all their members have respective zero\nvalues. Yes, zero-size types (such as with the above array length check) are guaranteed\nto be their own zero value, but that's not a particularly common scenario.\n\nZero length slices and maps would only be zero if they're also nil.\u003c/pre\u003e",
