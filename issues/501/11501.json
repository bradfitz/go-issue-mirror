	"body": "TestGoroutineProfile in the runtime tests has been timing out on freebsd-amd64 and freebsd-386 fairly regularly since June 19th.\r\n\r\nFor example, http://build.golang.org/log/d17f225a550e374216b3b3659083528163b22af9 (2015-07-01T10:37:10-1cbbd7f/freebsd-amd64-gce101) is the most recent and http://build.golang.org/log/60872d743598fe54d315bfcbded6321fb9c18ccc (2015-06-19T05:15:22-a3c0730/freebsd-amd64-gce101) is the first.\r\n\r\nIt looks like runtime.GoroutineProfile is stuck trying to acquire worldsema, but it's unclear who's holding it (presumably some runtime G that isn't being printed).\r\n\r\nLooking through the commit history leading up to the first failure, 90a1996 (runtime: reduce latency by aggressively ending mark phase, @RLH), e72f5f6 (runtime: fix tracing of syscallexit, @dvyukov), cfa3eda (runtime: fix race in scanvalid assertion, @rsc), and 3c60e6e (runtime: fix races in stack scan, @rsc) are the only ones that jump out at me as potentially related, but it may be none of those.",
