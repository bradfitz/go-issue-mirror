	"body": "My bad, it seems that rfc-5891 (\"Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA): Protocol\") obsoletes the \"nameprep\" rfc-3491 (\"Nameprep: A Stringprep Profile for IDN\") and states in \"Appendix A.  Summary of Major Changes from IDNA2003\":\r\n\r\n\u003e Remove the mapping and normalization steps from the protocol and have them, instead, done by the applications themselves, possibly in a local fashion, before invoking the protocol.\r\n\r\nSo I guess x/net/idna does the right thing and it is up to the caller to normalize or not. Though it means the caller should know whether a domain in non-normalized form is equivalent to one in normalized form, which I have no idea if it is (maybe it is incosistent in the wild, registration for `www.\\u00e9tat.com` and `www.e\\u0301tat.com` may or may not be separate domains?).\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows about that last part, I'd love to know (it would be very helpful for the `purell` normalization package that I maintain), but otherwise this is not an issue for the idna package, so I'll close it.",
