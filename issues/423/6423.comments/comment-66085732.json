Just\nset the Cmd.Env as desired.  The default is to inherit your existing process's\nenvironment, but you don't have to do that.\n\nSo this bug is only about unsetting an environment variable in the existing process,\nwhich is much less interesting, since the environment isn't a typical way to communicate\nwithin the lifetime of a program.  Typically you just look at the environment once at\nstart-up.\u003c/pre\u003e",
