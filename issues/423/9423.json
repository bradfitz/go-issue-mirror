	"body": "https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/1891/1 tried to rewrite flag's doc comments from saying things like 'A Flag ...' to 'Flag ...'. Using an article is completely okay in type doc comments and may lead to better, clearer documentation. The CL justified the change by saying that golint had flagged it. If this is true, golint should be changed.\r\n\r\n@dsymonds @robpike ",
