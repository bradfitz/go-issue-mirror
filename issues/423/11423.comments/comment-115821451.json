It's also standard practice to never indent with tabs - or in other words: \"standard practice elsewhere\" is not a compelling argument...\r\n\r\nThe formatting suggestion I offered does work and avoids the irregularity here - think of the parameter list as opening a scope: indeed, the parameters are part of the function's body scope, which is \"temporarily opened\", and then closed again (hence the outdent) for the result type, and the opened again (indent for body). It's very regular. It also works for named results, and it scales:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc DoSomething(\r\n    arg1 string,\r\n    arg2 int64,\r\n    arg3 float64,\r\n    arg4 bool,\r\n) {\r\n   res1 bool,\r\n   res2 string,\r\n   err error,\r\n} {\r\n    var1 := 0\r\n    var2 := \"\"\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBy scaling I mean for instance:\r\n```\r\nfunc DoSomething(\r\n    arg1 string,\r\n    arg2 func(\r\n        x int,\r\n        y float64,\r\n    ) bool,\r\n    arg3 float64,\r\n    arg4 bool,\r\n) {\r\n   res1 bool,\r\n   res2 string,\r\n   err error,\r\n} {\r\n    var1 := 0\r\n    var2 := \"\"\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nLeaving closed for now.",
