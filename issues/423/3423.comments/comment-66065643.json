I'll make the necessary modifications you stated and test over 64-bit.\nAbout the sin and cos implementations, I'll check if there are any differences, though I\nadd random noise to the attractor coordinates from (-0.0025, 0.0025) on each iteration,\nso I don't think the small deviation would differ a lot from that. I may have to take\nout the blur to check for differences. They are chaotic after all.\n\nI'll keep checking here for any updates on the issue. Thank you again for your insight.\u003c/pre\u003e",
