This is exactly the sort of obscure check that should be\ndone by default.\n\nI assume, since you are filing the bug, you have some client-certs that don't have the\nright EKU? Ideally you would create the certs with the correct EKU in the first place\nbut, if not, can't you use RequireAnyClientCert and take care of the verification\nyourself, with any options you wish?\u003c/pre\u003e",
