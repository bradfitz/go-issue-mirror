I don't think the Extended Key\nUsage should be checked by the tls code at all for these certificates. You can tell\nthese because they start with \"BEGIN CERTIFICATE\" rather than \"BEGIN TRUSTED\nCERTIFICATE\".  There appears to be no way to use a non EKU certificate as a client\ncertificate at the moment because of the code above.\n\nI haven't been able to create a client certificate with the EKU that the tls code can\nread (see the -addtrust clientAuth bit above) the tls code doesn't seem to be able to\nread certificates which start with \"BEGIN TRUSTED CERTIFICATE\".\n\nAs I see it client certs are in a kind of catch 22 place - they require the EKU, but the\ntls code can't read certificates in that format.\n\nAn alternative might be another kind of verification maybe\nRequireAndVerifyClientCertIgnoringEKU, or \nRequireAndVerifyClientCert and RequireAndVerifyClientCertWithEku\u003c/pre\u003e",
