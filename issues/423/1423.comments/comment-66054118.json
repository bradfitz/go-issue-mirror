This\nconfused me.  I've now gone to college, graduated and work with many different clients\n(I'm a contractor) and although I now use Linux as my primary workstation and understand\nwhy it technically works in most cases, as a contractor if a feature bothers a client\n(and this would), I fix it even when it's a pain to do given the existing framework.\n\nSo this is really a selfish request, I want to work with a library, not around it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
