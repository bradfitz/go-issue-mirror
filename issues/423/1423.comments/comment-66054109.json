Perhaps you would like to tell us why you have\nto have your path '\\' delimited, so we can understand what your problem is and try to\nhelp you.\n\nHaving single form that can be used on both Unix and Windows simplify things a bit. If\nyou would like to offer a change to have '\\' as path separator on Windows, please go\nahead, but it would have to be simple enough.\u003c/pre\u003e",
