It is therefore not clear for the reader what code is referred in the comment of snippet (2) and subsequent ones. At least, that was my experience.\r\n\r\nI would, transform (1) into a link to `#append` (to attract reader's attention and clarify what exactly `Append` is meant) and change (2) to something like:\r\n```diff\r\n- // Body exactly the same as above\r\n+ // Body is exactly the same as described in the Append section above.\r\n```\r\n",
