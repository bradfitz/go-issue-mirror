	"body": "\u003e Would love if compiler would recognize that compound types memory layout is flat and hash them as byte arrays.\r\n\r\nIt does.\r\n\r\nThe speed difference you're seeing is because there is a special-case fast path for maps with int32, int64, or string keys.  For maps of size 1 like you're benchmarking, we don't hash at all.  That is not the case for [12]byte or [3]int32 keys.\r\n\r\nWe might be able to fix your 1M benchmark.  We should still use the fast path if you just wrap an int64 in a struct.  I thought we did that already, but maybe not.\r\n",
