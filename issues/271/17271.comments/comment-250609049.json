This would mean that, to work without GOPATH, projects including sub-packages will have to refer to them with a relative path like \"./foo\". I think it's a reasonable compromise for projects that wish to build without GOPATH.\r\n\r\n(a possibly crazy idea is to also use canonical import path for this, that is a way of teaching the Go toolchain the path of the current project being built in a no-GOPATH scenario)",
