Users still need to understand how `$GOPATH` works, because that is also how import statements work in Go code because the compiler interprets an import statement as a path rooted at some location, that being a segment of the users' supplied `$GOPATH`. But that additional learning can take place _after_ they've been able to write small Go programs and go get code from others.",
