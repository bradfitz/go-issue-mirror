I never had somebody complain to me that choosing `GOPATH` was difficult per-se (as in, how to call the directory). Their main objection is that there's no good `GOPATH` location because they usually have projects layed out as `~/Sources/prjname`, and there is no good way of matching this layout with that imposed by `GOPATH`. Choosing a default  `GOPATH` would swap one confusing error message with another. If you go with defaulting `GOPATH` with something, they would **still** have to realise that:\r\n\r\n * There is a thing called `GOPATH`\r\n * That thing has a default (that might point to a directory they don't even have)\r\n * Checking out their project of choice in `$GOPATH/projectname` will still not work\r\n * Checking out their project of choice in `$GOPATH/src/projectname` might still not work (in case the project refers to one of its subpackage as `github.com/whatever/projectname/foo`).\r\n\r\nMy proposal removes all four hurdles above; it erases the whole cognitive load associated with `GOPATH` for the purpose of a clone+modify+push+pull-request cycle, and thus lowers the barriers of entry much more.\r\n\r\nAlso, if we look at a modern Go application, with all its dependencies correctly vendored, I really can't see what `GOPATH` is buying to a user that's just trying to edit and recompile such application. Every source file that must be built is already there; it looks overly aggressive to ask them to shuffle their directories around and set environment variables just to be able for the Go tool to find a library that is stored in the official `vendor` subfolder. It did make more sense when they had to `go get` to fetch the dependencies, but that step is not so common anymore.",
