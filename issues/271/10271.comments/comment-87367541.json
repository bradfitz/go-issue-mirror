	"body": "No, I am complaining about a different thing. I am complaining how the packages in -coverpkg are used.\r\nWhen I do:\r\n$ go test -c fmt\r\ncrypto/md5 package is not build at all. However, when I do:\r\n$ go test -c -coverpkg=crypto/md5 fmt\r\ncrypto/md5 is suddenly built. And the result of the build is unused. Why is that?\r\n\r\nThe documentation says:\r\n\t-coverpkg pkg1,pkg2,pkg3\r\n\t    Apply coverage analysis in each test to the given list of packages.\r\n\r\nSo I would assume that whatever -coverpkg value is or is expanded to, only an intersection of the list and the packages that would be built otherwise should matter.\r\n\r\n",
