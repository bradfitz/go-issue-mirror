	"body": "Your complaint is like complaining that \"cc *\" fails because some of the files aren't .c files. \"all\" is a wildcard and it means the same thing everywhere.\r\n\r\nI'm reluctant to add more wildcards to the cover tool's support in the go command, which is too complex already. And even if I weren't, I wouldn't know which ones to add. \"deps\" sounds ok but means we will cover things like runtime and reflect, which would be pointless.\r\n\r\nSolution: List the packages you care about. They're easy to find and easy to specify. Don't use \"all\".",
