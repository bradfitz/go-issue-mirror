	"body": "This is working as intended. The go/parser accepts a wider syntax than is permitted by the language spec, for simplicity, and robustness. Also, some (like this one) checks are easier done after parsing - putting them into the parser makes it harder for other tools (e.g. go/types: which error should it check for, and which should it not check for? This has implications for testing as some errors may be reported twice by different libs, etc.).\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/golang/go/commit/a3c0ca54b01284af40e684422a739d41b4cb9cfe\r\n(and also the bug associated with it).",
