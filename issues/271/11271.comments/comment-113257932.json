	"body": "It's quite unfortunate that downstream tools have to handle invalid syntax in the output of `go/parser`. This mismatch of expectations caused a bug in lint: https://github.com/golang/lint/issues/134. In that issue, @dsymonds mentions that he too would expect `go/parser` to handle this case. Gopherjs is another tool that now crashes on this kind of input. I'll check for others, but it's likely that many tools which are based on `go/parser` assume a receiver exists and will need to be changed to avoid crashes.",
