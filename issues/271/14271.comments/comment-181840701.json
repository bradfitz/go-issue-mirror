Since all the compiles happen in a symlink tree (on Linux it additionally uses a namespace sandbox), there is no possibility of confusion or need of -L options. In fact, it just sets \"-L . \": \r\n\r\n  https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/tools/build_rules/go/def.bzl#L245\r\n\r\nIf you added a -importmap option to the linker, the rules could probably be adapted for that, but it doesn't bring any benefit, just a little extra work.\r\n\r\nIt's probably too late to change this, but why not have GOPATH just apply to source directories? The artifacts would go then into a pkg/PREFIX/ directory, where you can work all relevant settings (race detector, $GOPATH, target architecture, compiler version, etc.) into PREFIX.\r\n",
