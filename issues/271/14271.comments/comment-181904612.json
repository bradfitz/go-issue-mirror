The artifacts would go then into a pkg/PREFIX/ directory, where you can work all relevant settings (race detector, $GOPATH, target architecture, compiler version, etc.) into PREFIX.\r\n\r\nThe original motivation for multiple GOPATH entries was to allow\r\nGOPATH=$HOME/mygo:/usr/local/systemgo. You can't just have one pkg/\r\ndirectory in that case: the user needs write access to update the packages\r\nfor $HOME/mygo's sources, but you want the systemgo packages read-only.\r\n\r\nRuss\r\n",
