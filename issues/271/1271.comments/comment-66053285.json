If you want the receiver to decode into an\ninterface, you must send an interface.  Otherwise the receiver doesn't in general have\nthe necessary information to store the concrete value.  There are cases, like this one,\nin which one could argue that the system should be able to work it out, but in general\nit cannot, so that's not the semantics of gobs.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
