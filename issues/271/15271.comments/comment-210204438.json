The assembler works (more or less) off the list of internal instruction names (see e.g. cmd/internal/obj/x86/anames.go). Those internal instruction names mostly match a well-defined pattern. PEXTRD doesn't fit that pattern; it sticks closer to x86 speak.\r\n\r\nIn a few important cases like the various Jxx mnemonics (JAE, JCC, JHI, etc.), there are synonyms. We could teach the assembler that PEXTRL is a synonym for PEXTRD. (Or we could rename PEXTRD to PEXTRL, but that'll break existing code unnecessarily.) It's not technically challenging to add synonyms, but it does contribute to sprawl. If you think we should add a synonym, please file a new issue and cc @robpike, who should probably make that call.\r\n\r\nHope that all makes sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
