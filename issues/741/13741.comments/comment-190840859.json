I can't find any reference to such in gomobile as what native_app_glue_code normally provides is handled in https://github.com/golang/mobile/blob/master/app/android.c without attaching a looper.\r\n\r\nMy best guess is this results in the crash seen on 4.x and the error of trying to detach a looper that was never attached is ignored on 5.x.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds right to you, then the call to `C.AInputQueue_detachLooper` should be removed and I'd assume should be called in `onInputQueueDestroyed` and I can submit a CL doing such.\r\n\r\n/cc @hyangah ",
