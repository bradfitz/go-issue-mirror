If each of those constants\nor variables deserves a comment before the variable/constant, consider making them\nseparate (ungrouped) declarations. That is, there is work-around, and grouping is\nintended to get this effect in the documentation.\n\nRemoving the extra blank lines in the groups would be desirable, but in general it's not\nclear which blank lines are intended by the author, and so it cannot be solved correctly\nall the time. Alternatively, godoc might simply ignore user intent, but that's not the\noriginal intention.\n\nIn the long run, we may want to redesign godoc (godoc2) and try different approaches.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
