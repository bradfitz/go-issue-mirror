	"body": "filepath.Abs can give incorrect results on unix systems.  The reason for this is it calls filepath.Clean() which does not take into account symbolic links when handling `..`.  For example in the sample program below it is incorrect to transform `dir2/dir1/../afile` to `dir2/afile` as dir1 is a symbolic link.\r\n\r\n\u003e What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo version go1.6.2 linux/amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003e What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/home/kevina/gocode2\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/usr/local/go\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64\"\r\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\"1\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n```\r\n\u003e What did you do?\r\n\r\nUse `filepath.Abs` in combination with symbolic links and `..`\r\n\r\nHere is a sample program at https://play.golang.org/p/ZAhkresUaD, but note it won't run on the playground.  To reproduce the results it needs to be run on a Unix system.\r\n\r\nThe programs creates the following files/dirs/symlink\r\n```\r\nafile\r\ndir1/\r\ndir2/\r\ndir2/dir1 -\u003e ../dir1\r\n```\r\nAnd than uses the path `dir2/dir1/../afile` to read `afile`.  This correctly resolves when the path it relative or the absolute path is created manually, but fails when filepath.Abs() is used.\r\n\r\nThe path `/somedir/dir2/dir1/../afile` should resolve to `/somedir/afile`; however filepath.Abs() transforms that to the incorrect `/somedir/dir2/afile`.\r\n\r\n\u003e What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nThe sample program should run without error.\r\n\r\n\u003e What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n`open /tmp/abstest062312103/dir2/afile: no such file or directory`\r\n",
