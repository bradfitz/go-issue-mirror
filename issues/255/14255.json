	"body": "One thing I observed with new gophers, is having trouble judging is when to use `new` and when to take the address of struct literal.\r\n\r\nAdding a bit of guidance in the wiki or effective_go.html would be quite useful.\r\n\r\nSuggestion for guidance:\r\n* prefer the literal\r\n* if you don't initialize the struct with values, use new\r\n* if you did use new, don't initialize values later, prefer switching the code to a literal instead.",
