	"body": "This is working as intended, or at least as documented:\n\n    Abs returns an absolute representation of path. If the path is not absolute\n    it will be joined with the current working directory to turn it into an\n    absolute path. The absolute path name for a given file is not guaranteed to\n    be unique. Abs calls Clean on the result.\n\nAnd Clean clearly states that:\n\n    Clean returns the shortest path name equivalent to path by purely lexical\n    processing. \n\nThe effect is that unusual symlinks can cause Abs to return non-working paths. \nThat's unfortunate, but it's unavoidable as documented.\n\nSymlinks like these cause strange behavior in other programs too. See the transcripts at the beginning of https://9p.io/sys/doc/lexnames.html, for example.",
