	"body": "It might be useful for Go newbies if there were a feedback link on documentation pages.  Systems like PHP permit people to add comments to every doc page, and those comments sometimes expand to be useful additions.  That is problematic because it leads directly to spam, but a simpler possibility would be a direct link to the issue tracker.\r\n\r\nCould we add something like this golang.org?  To godoc.org?  Do we want to?",
