I plan on open sourcing terminus\nsoon, but for now I have an alternate solution using only some of the packages.\n\nThe package github.com/adam000/Go-SDL2/demos/showimage (a main package) builds only\nreferencing packages within the repo (Go-SDL2/{sdl/keys,sdl,image}), so that's a nice\nlittle self-contained repro. There might be some work on it some time in the near\nfuture, so for future reference the SHA of the commit I'm testing with is\n327de6af0b00d765e4f2f0dfbddf56f2fc3104a1.\n\nIf there's anything else you need, let me know.\u003c/pre\u003e",
