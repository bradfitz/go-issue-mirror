	"body": "This is for 1.8.\r\n\r\nChange in the runtime and changes in the compiler (SSA, and porting) have caused the stack guard to creep up, and it needs to go back down.  It's temporarily extra-high because of the PPC port; this is filed to make a note of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe 3 files that must be changed in sync to modify the StackGuard size are:\r\n\r\nsrc/cmd/internal/obj/stack.go\r\nsrc/runtime/stack.go\r\ntest/nosplit.go\r\n\r\n\r\n",
