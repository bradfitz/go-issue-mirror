	"body": "by **antage**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI wrote a daemon for collecting and analyzing http requests -\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/antage/cdnstats\"\u003ehttps://github.com/antage/cdnstats\u003c/a\u003e\nAfter few days it is running in production I notice a memory leak.\nAs I imported net/http/pprof already I've digged in pprof reports.\n\n(pprof) top\nTotal: 318.5 MB\n   152.0  47.7%  47.7%    152.0  47.7% net/textproto.(*Reader).ReadLine\n   140.5  44.1%  91.8%    140.5  44.1% string_table.(*StringTable).Store\n    15.5   4.9%  96.7%    156.0  49.0% main.update\n     6.5   2.0%  98.7%      6.5   2.0% main.postProcess\n     3.5   1.1%  99.8%      3.5   1.1% net/textproto.(*Reader).ReadMIMEHeader\n     0.5   0.2% 100.0%      0.5   0.2% main.main\n     0.0   0.0% 100.0%    155.5  48.8% net/http.(*conn).readRequest\n     0.0   0.0% 100.0%    155.5  48.8% net/http.(*conn).serve\n     0.0   0.0% 100.0%    155.5  48.8% net/http.ReadRequest\n     0.0   0.0% 100.0%      0.5   0.2% runtime.main\n\nI think 152mb in net/textproto.(*Reader).ReadLine is a memory leak.\nAttached graph from pprof shows that source of the memory leak is net/http module.\n\nI don't stop the daemon so I can provide any additional information.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)? - 6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using? - Debian 6.0 amd64\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version') - go version go1.0.2\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3792/0/pprof10109.0.ps\"\u003epprof10109.0.ps\u003c/a\u003e (11723 bytes)",
