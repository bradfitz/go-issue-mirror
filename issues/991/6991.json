(run 'go version')\ngo version go1.2 linux/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nPostfix isn't pick about who to trust, neither should Go be since why use Go when it\nfails but Postfix does the job without complaining?\nImho this is a disadvantage for Go and it should be optional if you prefer to connect to\nCA approved hosts only or not. Theory and reality. I don't think there's a whole lot of\npeople buying extra certs just for a MTA given the price, especially if you can just\nsign it yourself and there really is no technical benefit in using an approved CA to\nsign your cert.\u003c/pre\u003e",
