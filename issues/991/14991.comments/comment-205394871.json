Splicing usually implies that the order of elements in a slice matters, thus use of the \"sort\" package may be an alternative to many of these needs.\r\n\r\nRegarding the specifically proposed function signature: I'd argue that Go tends toward \"i:j\" semantics rather than \"i:length\" semantics. deleteCount is similar to \"length\" in this case, rather than establishing a \"replacement window\" that, I at least, would expect.",
