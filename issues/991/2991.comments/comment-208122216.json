Please let me know if this is alright and I can spin up a CL.\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n- A collection of instructions that execute a procedure.\r\n- defined with keyword `func`.\r\n- scope and definition determined/enclosed in braces `{}`.\r\n- invoked by a starting '(' and a closing ')' and passing any arguments within parentheses. Arguments may be variadic.\r\n- Anonymous or named(but must have a unique name within a scope).\r\n- Must have terminating statement e.g panic, return.\r\n- May take in zero or more typed arguments within the opening '(' and ')'.\r\n- May return zero or more typed arguments.\r\n- May invoke other functions including itself.\r\n\r\n### Definition Trial\r\nA function is a collection of instructions defined with a starting keyword `func` defining a scope by braces `{` and `}`, and that may perform operations on data. A function takes zero or more typed arguments that are enclosed within balanced parentheses ie `(` and `)` and may or may not return typed arguments.\r\nA function may or may not have a name after the keyword `func` e.g `func foo() {` or `func() {` and can only be invoked by the function's name or definition site without the preceding keyword `func`, using balanced parentheses to pass in arguments. A function must have a terminating statement that is a `panic` or `return`.\r\nWhen a function returns a value or more, the values can be received positionally by variable assignment.",
