	"body": "This proposal is for adding a builtin splice function for adding/removing items in a slice:\r\n```go\r\nsplice(slice []Type, start, deleteCount int, elems ...Type) []Type\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile the builtin append function can do everything that a splice function can, its a lot trickier to use for anything other than append, even by experienced go users.  Newcomers to the language struggle with simple tasks of slice modification, and there are a lot of posted questions about them. It doesn't help that a function named ```append``` is supposed to be used for removing items from a slice.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people might be familiar with the splice function and its notation from other mainstream languages.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem like much, but it's a low hanging fruit that will help people new to the language.",
