	"body": "I'm sorry this seems unrelated to the original issue. The reason for using `select {}` over `for {}` is they both block the current goroutine from making any further progress, but the former does it by removing the goroutine from the scheduler (as none if its zero cases are selectable), the latter does so by spinning in a loop which cannot be interrupted.\r\n\r\nIf you believe there is a bug, can you please produce a runnable sample that does not use a `for {}` loop, preferably on play.golang.org, that demonstrates the issue.",
