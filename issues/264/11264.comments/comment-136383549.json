	"body": "\u003e @johto sorry, but I don't see how that is a good reason to leave such a basic, and destructive bug because it's been \"like this forever\". 1.5.2, sure, I can understand that and be patient, but having to wait 6 months for this class of bug to be fixed saddens and worries me. I hope we can strive for a higher standard.\r\n\r\nMy point is that since it's been like this forever, I expect most drivers to have worked around the issue already.  For new drivers it feels unreasonable to expect everyone to be on 1.5.1 or later, so even the authors of such projects will need to work around the issue.\r\n\r\nWhat this bug needs more than anything in my view is publicity, not rushed fixes.",
