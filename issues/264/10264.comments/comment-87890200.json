A hard coded path is useful as a fall back but I would like to be able to run the commands out of the build directory without installing them as well. A little bit of flexibility is surely welcomed. I appreciate the way that the go system all works together and that Is a great feature, and it should work that way by default but some users are going to want to influence the way it runs.",
