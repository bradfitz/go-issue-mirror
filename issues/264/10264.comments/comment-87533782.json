For example, escape analysis (cmang is\nworking\non that) or whole program analysis to devirtualize interface calls.\n\nthe cgo in gc repository doesn't support many of the architectures that\ngccgo\nsupport, and I'm not convinced you should compile cgo from the gc and put\nit into gccgo's tooldir.\n",
