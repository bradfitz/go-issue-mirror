The go tool in the gc\nrepository supports overriding GOROOT, and due to\nmiscommunication with the users, we received bug reports\noriginating from the fact that the user installed a new version\nof Go but forgot to change GOROOT, so the new go command\nis still using the old tools (cgo, 6g, 6l, etc.)\n\ncmd/go doesn't respect $GOTOOLDIR now, I see no reason\nto add a new environment variable and repeat the same mistake\nagain.\n\nIf the user compiles a custom gccgo, a corresponding cmd/go\nshould also be built.\n",
