But one could reasonably argue that a constant index value outside the bounds\nof an int64 should lead to a compile-time error.\n\nI propose that we follow the precedent set with len/cap (\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/ref/spec#Length_and_capacity\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/ref/spec#Length_and_capacity\u003c/a\u003e ) and always report a run-time error in\nthis case (even though it means that in some cases the compiler will simply statically\ngenerate code for a runtime error).\u003c/pre\u003e",
