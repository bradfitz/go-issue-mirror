Because ValueOf\ntakes an interface{}, the static type of the argument is lost and cannot be recovered.\nYou are arguing that the result in this case should have type interface{}, but what if\nthe argument was a nil io.Reader?\n\nYes, the API has a flaw. But it's pretty fundamental to the use of the interface{} as an\nargument.\nIt's better to leave the flaw than make things worse by adding patches.\n\nIn your case, it is easy to check for src == nil in your wrapper.\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/FiPiyKtPmi\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/FiPiyKtPmi\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
