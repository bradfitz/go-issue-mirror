In the func case the name 'f' is\ndefined, and is a func, so a more specific error is given (that is, it\nmeans f is defined, just not a type). In this case, the name 'f' really is\nundefined. This isn't C++: you can't use f to refer to method or field\nnames when inside a method body.\n\nOf course, we could change the compiler to detect this case, where a method\nname was used, inside its own body, as a type name. But I have no idea why\nanyone would do that, so I cannot imagine that it is a common enough case\nto warrant special code.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
