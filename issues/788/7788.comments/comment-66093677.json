Right now kqueue (BSD/OSX) are doing a bunch of extra work to\nwatch the files in a directory... it actually only provides what you are asking for\nhere. inotify (Linux) offers both options. FSEvents (OSX) is oriented around watching\neverything in a directory, it may not provide this option. I don't recall for Windows.\nWe're still not sure how we'll sort out all these differences.\n\nThis is further complicated by text editors often using \"atomic saves\" by creating a new\nfile and then renaming it overtop of the old one. Even with kqueue, this results in an\nevent saying \"something has changed in this directory\", whereas a simple touch would be\nignored without a file-level watch.\n\nSo I'm not sure what the right answer is. It looks like we can't really rely upon\nRemoveWatch to be used this way. The easiest solution for now is probably to filter out\nthe exclusions yourself as you receive events over the channel.\u003c/pre\u003e",
