What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nUbuntu 14.04.02 Trusty\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/JSKCIMotEE\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nA different output string, and a different sequence of integers in the array.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nThe exact same output string, and the exact same sequence of integers in the array.\r\n\r\nBasically using a different seed (especially one that's numerically quite different) should probably generate a different random sequence. It's very possible that that's just a limitation of the algorithm and that's life but just in case this is actually a bug I wanted to file it so at least someone with more knowledge than me could confirm it either way.",
