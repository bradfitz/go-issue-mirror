	"body": "@ianlancetaylor What is the backport policy on a change like this.  Must it go upstream before it can be backported to the Go 1.6 branch?  The reason I'm asking is that the latest additions to my fix (the risky ones?) are needed because of the new method offset tables (int32) in Go 1.7 that depend on absolute offsets of methods rather than relocated addresses like they were in Go 1.6.  My previous patch mostly worked for Go 1.6, but needs the minor addition of more searching in functab.",
