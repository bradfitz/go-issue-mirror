It is generated in cmd/compile/internal/gc/reflect.go.\r\n\r\nWhen a concrete type has methods, the reflect.rtype is followed by a reflect.uncommonType which has an offset to an array of reflect.method structures, which contain the text offsets you mention.\r\n\r\nThe compiler creates the text offsets by generating an R_METHODOFF relocation, which cmd/link turns into a R_ADDROFF relocation and then turns into a section offset. For the reflect.method structure, this R_METHODOFF is generated in dextratypeData. (In particular, see dmethodptrOffLSym.)",
