Another\npossibility is that we always generate the longer form of branch/call\ninstructions at compile time, and rewrite them into short branch/call and\nnops during linking when we know the distance is not too far away.\n\nI agree similar issue will eventually hit other RISC architectures because\nas far as I know, none of them support huge branches.\n",
