	"body": "Based on the comments from Brad and Ian in #16356 I didn't think any patch for this problem in Go 1.7 was going to be accepted.  Did I misunderstand that?  So I don't understand why you are trying to find a solution for it there.\r\n\r\nAs far as the long term fix, I think that changing the generated code is as risky or more than my original fix.  The section split can only happen on ppc64le now so any of your concerns about what might go wrong if the sections are split can't happen on other platforms.  We have built and tested programs where the sections are split and I've inspected the symbols and they have correct addresses even if they are in the additional text sections.  I'm not sure what your concerns are about the pcdata.  I think it is best to generate correct elf sections in a way so that the GNU linker can solve this problem since it already knows how instead of reinventing another solution for it.\r\n\r\nI have some ideas on how to improve the way my patch is using the method offset table, but I want to do some experiments before posting anything.\r\n\r\nAs far as the same problem in a pure Go binary, the solution/suggested workaround could be to require that they use external linking in that situation.\r\n",
