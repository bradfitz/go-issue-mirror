	"body": "What has to happen to move forward with this issue and patch?\r\n\r\nI have tried some experimentation with modifying the call sequences.  I still think there is risk in making those changes too.\r\n\r\nI don't have enough detail from @minux previous proposals to understand fully what he is suggesting and if he is the one who is planning to implement them.  If his plan is to change the code sequences at assembly time then that means all imported packages would need changing too so those calls are fix and thus all imported packages need rebuilding.\r\n\r\nIf there are concerns with my patch related to the way sections are generated I can clean it up and/or make it more specific to ppc64le only if I know what areas are of concern.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how to proceed because this is a big issue since it prevents several Kubernetes binaries from building and we need to get a fix into 1.8.\r\n\r\n",
