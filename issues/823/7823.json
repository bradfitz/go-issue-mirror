	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCurrently godoc only exposes the documentation of exported types, vars, etc.\n\nHowever, there are a number of cases where it would be convenient to expose unexported\ntypes: when there is a variable or constant of that type and when a function or method\ntakes or returns values of that type.\n\nIf the unexported type has exported methods, this allows them to be shown in godoc. It\nis less important if it does not, but it would still allow godoc to render a link to\nthat type, showing its docs, consts, and vars.\n\nThe same effect, of course, can be generated by exporting the type, but leaving it\nunexported, if nothing else, is a signal that users should not create arbitrary values\nof this type, which has to be manually documented if you export the type.\n\nThis is related, conceptually and likely implementation-wise, to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/5860\"\u003eissue #5860\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/5397\"\u003eissue #5397\u003c/a\u003e\nand its duplicate (that contains more information) \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/7815\"\u003eissue #7815\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
