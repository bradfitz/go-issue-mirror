There is no restriction in ARMv6, and it is\nbelieved all relevant ARMv4 and ARMv5 implementations do not require this\nrestriction either, because high performance multipliers read all their operands\nprior to writing back any results.\n\nso i think we're safe.\n\nPS: i think the old restriction is for cpus with iterative multipliers where the\nmultipler is not single-cycle so it might reuse the destination register as a\nscratch register for intermediate results. we require ARMv5E and above, and\nthey all have proper pipelined hardware multipler, thus it's no longer an issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
