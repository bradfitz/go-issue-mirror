Suspect len(c.pendingData) is used when c.myWindow should be used. \nWhen server sends the adjust window message, both the c.pendingData and c.myWindow\nshould probably be adjusted.\n\nI'm not sure about this, and will need to carefully inspect this logic to confirm/fix,\nbut this current logic appears to be lax in this area.\u003c/pre\u003e",
