Then we'd just call it `IdleTimeout` and be done with it.\r\n\r\nBut with HTTP/2, do we care about clients sending a `PING` or other useless frame every N seconds vs. actually sending real requests every N seconds? If so, we need names for both types of idle (network idle vs no-HTTP-requests idle). Or we define `IdleTimeout` to mean one thing, and give `ReadTimeout` the other meaning (see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16958#issuecomment-244239789)?\r\n\r\nOpinions welcome. Ideally with sample documentation you'd tell users.\r\n\r\nI got as far as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        // ReadTimeout optionally specifies a maximum duration before                                                                                        \r\n        // timing out reads of request headers.
