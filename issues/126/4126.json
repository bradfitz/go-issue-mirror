The\n    // value -1 indicates that the length is unknown.  Unless RequestMethod\n    // is \u0026quot;HEAD\u0026quot;, values \u0026gt;= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may\n    // be read from Body.\n    ContentLength int64\n}\n\n... suggesting that we should be setting it when we know it.\n\nRelated, Response.Write should write the correct length.  Currently the one in the\nheader map is being ignored in favor of the zero.\u003c/pre\u003e",
