	"body": "Implement cgo with external linking for linux/mips64 and linux/mips64le (MIPS N64 ELF ABI, big- and little-endian). Work includes:\r\n\r\n- complete external linking support (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12560)\r\n- fill in the portions of [src/runtime/asm_mips64x.s](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/asm_mips64x.s) marked \"no cgo yet\", plus whatever else cgo requires\r\n- enable cgo external link tests, and get (cd [misc/cgo/test](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/misc/cgo/test) \u0026\u0026 go test -linkmode=external) to pass on Linux on mips64 and mips64le hardware\r\n\r\nInitial testing can be done using qemu-user for mips64 and mips64le targets running on any host. [Skyport Systems](https://www.skyportsystems.net/) (my employer) can also provide access to mips64le hardware for testing.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/golang/go/issues/8912 for a description of similar work for ppc64 (though internal linking support is optional/extra credit). For a working example, browse the current arm64 code, which supports exactly the functionality sought for mips64 (cgo with external linking, not internal linking).",
