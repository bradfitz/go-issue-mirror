But scheduler fails to schedule all goroutines\nfairly.\nI've mail \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/53080043/\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/53080043/\u003c/a\u003e with a fix.\n\nShane, the program causes extremely frequent garbage collections (heap size is almost\nzero, and the loop generates garbage). You can increase portion of time spent in the\nlogging library (rather than GC) by adding some garbage ballast, e.g.\nvar ballast = make([]byte, 64\u0026lt;\u0026lt;20)\nThis will reduce frequency of GCs tremendously.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.3**, removed **release-none**._",
