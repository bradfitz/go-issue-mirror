Thanks to those who helped fix my code to avoid the undesired\nbehavior.\n\nFeel free to close this bug as invalid if go is working as desired. I'm concerned that\noptimizing for throughput\nto the extent that a timer is called 30x to 90x later than requested even when the tight\nloop has both I/O and\nfunction calls (2 things that I think of as opportunities to switch goroutines) will\nmake writing working code\nmuch harder than it should be.\n\nMaybe this is actually a feature request \"Wakeup from sleep within an order of magnitude\nof the time\nrequested even if other goroutines are doing I/O\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
