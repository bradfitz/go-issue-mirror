	"body": "What version of Go are you using (go version)? \r\n1.5.1\r\n\r\nWhat operating system and processor architecture are you using? \r\nwindows 7; Intel i3 \r\n\r\nWhat did you do?\r\ntesting x/net/webdav package on Windows\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to see?\r\nA listing of Files of the webdav root inside explorer \r\n\r\nWhat did you see instead?\r\nan error .-)\r\n\r\nThe sample with the mem filesystem worked fine, but the Dir Filesystem doesn't. \r\nThe error is caused by a setting of a struct at line 134 of file prop.go\r\n\r\nThe comment says:\r\n...\r\n105:\t// dir is true if the property applies to directories.\r\n106:\tdir bool\r\n...\r\n\r\n...\r\n131:\txml.Name{Space: \"DAV:\", Local: \"getcontenttype\"}: {\r\n132:\t\tfindFn: findContentType,\r\n133: //\tdir:    true,  // \u003c- this setting causes the error \r\n134:\t\tdir:    false, // \u003c- setting it to false works fine\r\n135:\t},\r\n...\r\n\r\nIf dir is true the findContenttype is called for a Directory and that causes an error. I solved the problem this way and i don't know wether a directory could have a Content-Type. I don' think so.\r\n\r\nthanks, Horst Noreick\r\n\r\nEdit: the finename prop.go",
