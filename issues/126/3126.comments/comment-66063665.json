It's not a special case in the language, so\nit doesn't need to be a special case here.  As Ian notes, you have to use a temporary\nvalue one way or another, even for x, y = y, x.  Providing a wrapper wouldn't change\nthat.\n\nThe interface thing is a bug, but I see a separate issue has already been filed for that.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
