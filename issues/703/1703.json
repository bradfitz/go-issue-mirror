	"body": "by **kai@tinkercad.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003etinkercad.com was seeing 10%-15% of our users fail to connect to our https servers due\nto the browser using SSL 3.0 instead of TLS 1.0. agl speculates that this might occur\nboth due to misconfigurations and due to browser automatically downgrading from TLS 1.0\nto SSL 3.0.\n\nFor sites running https a recommendation would be to monitor any http/https transitions\nto try to verify how much of their population is running into this issue.\n\nAs per offline discussion, please file this bug against agl to track adding SSL 3.0\nsupport to crypto/tls.\u003c/pre\u003e",
