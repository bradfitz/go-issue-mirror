	"body": "Is this inconsistency intentional?  Select is a POSIX function and has the same 'int' return value on all supported platforms where it's available, so it seems odd to only expose it on Linux.\r\n\r\n(Motivation: I was trying to use github.com/jaracil/poll on OpenBSD, but ironically its Select-based fallback for non-Linux OSes is written assuming the Linux Select API.)",
