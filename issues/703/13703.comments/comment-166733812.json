A number of places in the go command and other tools assume that an import \"C\" means cgo, and the functions that perform this check don't necessarily have access to the import-path-to-package-path resolving logic.  So it is inherently simpler to make the C and unsafe pseudo-packages special (w.r.t. vendoring; they are already special in other ways) and doing so doesn't lose any particular utility.\r\n",
