(This limitation is unfortunate and not well advertised.)\r\n\r\n(The golang.org/x/tools/go/loader package provides an alternative means of getting type information for dependencies, by loading and type checking the whole program from source.  However, gotype doesn't use it, not least because it is not in the standard library.)",
