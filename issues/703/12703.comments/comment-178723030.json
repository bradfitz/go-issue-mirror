	"body": "@FiloSottile x/tools/cmd/gotype is on life-support only (keep it building for now) since it depends on x/tools/go/types which also is not further developed. Instead, the new versions of both are now in the standard library: The most up-to-date type-checker is go/types, and the directory contains a stand-alone gotype command (see comment in gotype.go for how to build that binary).\r\n\r\nThus, both the library and the gotype command are now independent of x/tools. We don't want to introduce a dependency on x/tools by using x/tools/go/loader.\r\n\r\nThe long-term plan is to determine a long-term solution/placement for x/tools/go/loader; we are hoping to make some progress on this for 1.7.",
