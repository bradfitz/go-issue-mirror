We don't run with race\ndetection regularly. But we do from time to time the program was run with the race\ndetector in response to the initial occurrence of the error. Races were detected and\nfixed. But I don't think we ever managed to run the detector when the fatal error\nactually exhibited itself.\n\nWe will start running processes compiled with race detection again to see if there is\nanything new.\n\nIn the meantime the stackdump can be found here.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bmatsuo/1a323e1484930eeadb9b/raw/61769333c6d8d8bed0a22b6f2e0f633f637193d1/gistfile1.txt\"\u003ehttps://gist.githubusercontent.com/bmatsuo/1a323e1484930eeadb9b/raw/61769333c6d8d8bed0a22b6f2e0f633f637193d1/gistfile1.txt\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
