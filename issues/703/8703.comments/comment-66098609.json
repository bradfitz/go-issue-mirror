We also encode/decode using snappy (w/ framing format). I don't see a\nsnappy frame headers in there. I'm not familiar enough with the underlying format to see\nthose bytes. \n\nHere's the signature of that \"copy\" method:\n\nfunc (*TmpShuttle) copy(io.Reader, int64, int64, chan\u0026lt;- int64) (*TempFile, int64,\nerror)\n\nSorry I can't just tell you the type of 0x3ea12e0be826d695 :( There's something I don't\nunderstand and I have a hard time reading those traceback values. Sometimes it seems\nlike there are more 'arguments' than I'd expect or can explain, sometimes fewer \u0026gt;_\u0026lt;\n\nI don't think it's possible to share these things even privately. I can continue to try\nand whittle down to something that is more of a toy example that can be shared and\nre-run easily.\n\nSorry, it's not ideal. But I wanted to get the issue out there in case other people see\nthe same things elsewhere.\u003c/pre\u003e",
