As I mentioned we ran with race detection\nfor a few days last time and fixed all the reported races. And \"absence of evidence\",\ninfrequent occurrence at full speed (no -race), all that.\n\nIf you both think it's a race then you could close the ticket for now. And I'm sorry for\nwasting valuable time. Thanks for the help, though.\n\nCheers\u003c/pre\u003e",
