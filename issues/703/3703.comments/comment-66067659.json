They include \u0026lt;link\u0026gt; as\nper the standard, then later include \u0026lt;atom10:link\u0026gt;, and no global xmlns on the\nmain \u0026lt;rss\u0026gt; tag to help disambiguate the two, so the first literally has no\nnamespace at all.\n\nI tried several things to get around this, including using `xml:\" link\"` to explicitly\nspecify to match a blank namespace (which was a long shot, obviously), and then found\nthat the code I'm looking for is src/pkg/encoding/xml/read.go on line 242 which\n(rightfully) ignores an empty namespace so that if we don't care about namespaces, we\ndon't have to specify them.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what a solid fix for this might be, but figured I would add an\nextra couple cents here.\n\nMy only idea is to add a special case namespace string that intentionally matches the\ncase of an empty namespace (thus a tag like `xml:\"_ link\"`), but that might conflict\nwith using something like xmlns:_=\"\u003ca href=\"http://example.com\"\u003ehttp://example.com\u003c/a\u003e\" or xmlns:something=\"_\" (which I\nfreely admit that I don't know if are valid, thus whether really are problems).\u003c/pre\u003e",
