Stepping\nout is what confuses gdb in this case, and the only solution is to use \"bt\" to figure\nout how you got where you are, then you need to set a breakpoint in the caller and\n\"c\"ontinue.\n\nCompiling with -l (disable inlining) breaks stepping in as well. In this case, gdb takes\nyou directly into the thunk rather than into the callee. From here you can only \"stepi\"\nyour way into the callee. Stepping out is broken as before.\u003c/pre\u003e",
