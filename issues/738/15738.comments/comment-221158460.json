I haven't looked into the problem yet--I'm looking at the gc 1.7 release and internal stuff before I return to working on gccgo.\r\n\r\nOK, I took a very quick look.  The comment for `Package::set_priority` says\r\n\r\n    // Set the priority.  We may see multiple priorities for an imported\r\n    // package; we want to use the largest one.\r\n\r\nSo why isn't that working?\r\n\r\nI also see this comment, earlier, so I think that this did work at one time:\r\n\r\n    \t  // If a test of package P1, built as part of package P1,\r\n    \t  // imports package P2, and P2 imports P1 (perhaps\r\n    \t  // indirectly), then we will see the same import name with\r\n    \t  // different import priorities.  That is OK, so don't give\r\n    \t  // an error about it.",
