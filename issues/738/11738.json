	"body": "On the current development git tip, an attempt to do 'go get -d github.com/derekparker/delve/cmd/dlv' fails for me with the following error message:\r\n\r\n    package github.com/derekparker/delve/cmd/dlv\r\n        imports github.com/derekparker/delve/service\r\n        imports github.com/derekparker/delve/service/api\r\n        imports github.com/derekparker/delve/proc\r\n        imports C: unrecognized import path \"C\"\r\n\r\nI'm on 64-bit Fedora 22 Linux and I believe that this 'go get' is thus failing on the 'import \"C\"' in github.com/derekparker/delve/proc/breakpoints_linux_amd64.go. If I fetch the repo and so on by hand, I can do 'go install github.com/derekparker/delve/cmd/dlv' without problems; everything builds successfully. It's only the initial 'go get' that fails.\r\n\r\nA run of git bisect reports that the first bad commit is af96030150217fe711eac5ee994b44705bfb6832 'cmd/go: fix go get -u handling of changing dependencies', which at least appears to be a related change.",
