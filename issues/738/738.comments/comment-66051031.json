There is simply no reason to, \nsince not only does the error return indicate that the count is incomplete, but it makes\nsense for the count to be a positive value \nfor an incomplete read.\n\nIn short, Read() implementations should not force callers to make two error checks on\nevery call.  Not only is it annoying, it makes \ncode that uses Read() more subtle and bug-prone. There is no bug in bufio.\n\nOne can debate whether correct behavior needs to be verified on every call to an\nexternal function.  I prefer requiring functions to \nbehave correctly so callers can build on that trust.\u003c/pre\u003e",
