	"body": "That ticket discusses CGI child behavior and re-creation of the http.Request.RemoteAddr out of ENV variables that Apache or other server has set. Sure, when it was set by Go cgi-enabled server, things would go even worse, since REMOTE_ADDR already has \"IP:port\" it would become \"IP:port:0\" due to missing REMOTE_PORT var.\r\n\r\nHere is where error goes in testing of CGI module:\r\n\r\n    func newRequest(httpreq string) *http.Request {\r\n    \tbuf := bufio.NewReader(strings.NewReader(httpreq))\r\n    \treq, err := http.ReadRequest(buf)\r\n    \tif err != nil {\r\n    \t\tpanic(\"cgi: bogus http request in test: \" + httpreq)\r\n    \t}\r\n    \treq.RemoteAddr = \"1.2.3.4\"\r\n    \treturn req\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTest sets RemoteAddr to static 1.2.3.4 value while http.Request documentation mentions that it's IP:port string... \r\n\r\nIf anyone would comment why that is string and not carried out net.Conn (*net.TCPConn I believe), I would gladly hear it and educate myself :) Fixing this IMO is out of scope of the problem, REMOTE_ADDR might be corrected in CGI and testing mishap that I described above is a small correction too.",
