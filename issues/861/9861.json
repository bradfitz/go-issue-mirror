	"body": "In all recent versions (1.4.x) cgi library puts http.Request RemoteAddr into both REMOTE_ADDR and REMOTE_HOST env vars. That is a string that has \"IP:port\" combination.\r\n\r\nCGI 1.1 standard asks to put only IP address to REMOTE_ADDR and omit port...  I suggest to make things work this way too. \r\n\r\nApache puts port into REMOTE_PORT variable (which is not in spec and not that important to have). I'd vote for ignoring port alltogether.\r\n",
