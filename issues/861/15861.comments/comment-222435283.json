There is no cgo - we have a counter on the status page saying how many calls to cgo there have been which stays at 1. No SWIG either. No unsafe, I double checked because I was surprised we managed to remove every instance of it.\r\n\r\nThe single finalizer (which is not needed and we should probably remove it) is unlikely to be called so early in the execution of the server. And even if it does it does not look like #13347 . \r\n\r\nThe interesting thing here is that running it with start-stop-daemon and -u flag is the only thing that makes it crash. The documentation for start-stop-daemon says that it sets HOME to the user's home which was tried with sudo and *no* crash:\r\n```bash\r\nHOME=/dev/null sudo -u user start-stop-daemon --start ./nedomi # yes the user home is /dev/null\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm gonna try to run a few more tests later today in hopes of giving better directions on how reproduce it from `run it with start-stop-daemon on the gentoo that we are using`",
