	"body": "the manual for the start-stop-daemon used at the machine says that `-u` is used to switch user('-c' is synonym for it). Running the nedomi(the program in question) in any other way but with start-stop-daemon with '-u' works in so far as it doesn't crash for at least a few minutes.  \r\nQuotes:\r\n```\r\n     -u, --user user[:group]\r\n             Start the daemon as the user and update $HOME accordingly or stop daemons owned by the user. You can optionally append a group name here also.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n     -c, --chuid user\r\n             Same as the -u, --user option.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe actual way that we found that nedomi runs at all on the server is that I ran it without anything to see how long it takes to crash. \r\nWe tried with different arguments to start-stop-daemona and/or sudo as well as changing $HOME to the actual home of the user, while using sudo. And only start-stop-daemon with '-u' let to a very fast crash. Everything else seemed to run flawlessly for at least a minute. The server is still running with no crashes while using sudo + start-stop-daemon. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately more pressing things at work mean that I can't actually investigate more on how it crashes. The installed star-stop-daemon should be build from [this tree](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/openrc.git/tree/?h=openrc-0.9.9.x\u0026id=aac509837e71ff30f9cb08d9a5c214644519b888) as it belongs to openrc-0.9.9.3 package\r\n",
