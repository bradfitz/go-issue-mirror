You can use\n\"info threads\" to see the threads and \"thread N\" to change to a thread.  You can use\n\"bt\" to get a backtrace for the current thread.\n\nIf the system still works, but the program does not respond to signals, that suggests\nthat signals have somehow been blocked.  I don't see how that could happen but I have no\nother suggestions.\u003c/pre\u003e",
