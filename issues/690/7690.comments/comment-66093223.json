The former should be backed up when translating\nto a line number but the latter should not. I tried a few things but they are incomplete\nand I think make the situation more confusing than it is now. I think we'll need to\npostpone this to Go 1.4.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.4**, removed **release-go1.3maybe**._",
