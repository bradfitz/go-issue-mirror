That doesn't guarantee a high quality library, but having a way to opt-out of the index makes sense. \r\n\r\nForks of a project also would be hidden from GoDoc.org based on the same mechanism, though I think that's being solved in other ways these days.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be a good idea to start one or more new threads over at https://github.com/golang/gddo/issues or golang-dev?\r\n\r\nSo far I've created one new issue based on this discussion thread:\r\n* https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17312 go builders and trybots for third-party repositories",
