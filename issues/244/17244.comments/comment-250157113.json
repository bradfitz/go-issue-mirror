This proposal is not going to affect your daily interaction with the project.\r\n\r\nI disagree. I spent a significant amount of my time, over a number of months, on design and code reviews for golang.org/x/mobile/audio (later moved to golang.org/x/mobile/exp/audio). This was time I wasn't spending, day to day, on my other work.\r\n\r\nI spent my time this way because, as @cespare alluded to above, there is a community expectation that anything under golang.org/x is of high quality. I was also actively working on golang.org/x/mobile at the time, and a number of people have said that they'd like an audio or audio/visual or media Go package to have pluggable codecs the way the standard library's image and image/* packages works and, well, I designed and wrote those image packages.\r\n\r\nYou say that \"being able to work under an x allows me to reach out to the go approvers\" and sure, that's a benefit for you, but it is a cost for the Go approvers. If it's easier for everyone to demand @bradfitz's attention for anything potentially under golang.org/x/net, or @ianlancetaylor's attention for anything potentially under golang.org/x/sys, then that's less attention that they could spend on e.g. landing HTTP/2 support, or keeping gccgo up to date. It is not a free lunch, and as others have said above, it doesn't scale.\r\n\r\nIt's true that golang.org/x/exp/... (and similar paths like golang.org/x/mobile/exp/...) have lower quality and support expectations than the rest of golang.org/x, but my opinion is that the right response is to move those packages out of golang.org/x, rather than add more exp packages.",
