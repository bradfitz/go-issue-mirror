People shouldn't have to ask for permission to experiment; that has a chilling effect on experimentation.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if something is to be included in an /x sub-repo, they need to ask permission. Why should they? Shouldn't they be able to put their high quality code in a repo somewhere else, and have it be regarded just as highly as anything in /x? Code should be judged on its own merits, not by its location.",
