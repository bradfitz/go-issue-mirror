	"body": "The fsnotify codebase originated from code contributed to Go, then moved to x/exp, and now maintained in a separate GitHub organization. At one point we had all contributors sign the Google CLA, but I haven't been good about enforcing it for patches since. üôÅ \r\n\r\nIf a project like gomobile were moved outside of x/, I assume the CLA would still be required. Is there tooling to help enforce it? Does it require a Gerrit workflow or is it independent of Gerrit? \r\n\r\nContributions to GitHub's repositories have a CLA check, so it is something that can be done on GitHub, though I don't know the implementation details.\r\n\r\n![github-cla](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4566/19452065/b53610ca-946c-11e6-8488-ff95f51aba59.png)\r\n\r\nThat would address the technical issue of enforcing the CLA -- independent of repository location.\r\n\r\nThe other issue I personally have is that the non-endorsement license and Google CLA feel awkward for fsnotify specifically. It isn't currently a Google-run project, but needs the CLA and license for a potential future use in core. Which ends up feeling like an endorsement. Heh.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this applies to any other projects that may be moved out of the x/ subrepos? Projects that may no longer under the review of Go team members (that's kind've the point of all this), but are low-level enough that they still may be useful as internal/ packages in core.",
