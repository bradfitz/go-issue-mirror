Let's say gorilla/websocket could make it one day in it as it's known to be better than the standard implementation for websockets. Or things like Go mobile. We already have x/net/http for the http2 support there, no? I'd like to still be able to have a: we'll break compatibility if needed that is less strict than Go's one. And those packages don't have to make it in stdlib for 1.x lifecycle, maybe Go 2.x will be good enough. There are few things which Go misses and for that x/ would be good. Maybe a similar tools/ will be added to move the supporting tools.",
