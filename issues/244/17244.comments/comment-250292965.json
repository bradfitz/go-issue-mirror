	"body": "To scale kernel development, Linus named Trusted Lieutenants as guardians of different subsystems. @rakyll's idea for creating \"Trusted Gophers\" available for code review for external projects is an interesting one.  However, it's hard to do code review without context.  It's easy to comment on style and naming, but hard to discuss design without understanding the problem domain.  Drive-by reviewers provide only superficial help here.  Dealing with reviewing \"yet another\" web framework or whatever will also get tiring.  I think this deserves more discussion, but possibly in a different forum that this issue.",
