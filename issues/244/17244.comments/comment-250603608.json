	"body": "@kardianos thanks for those extra points. I've added them to the list. My opinion on them:\r\n\r\n\u003e To use the same consistent license (with CLA) that the project uses.\r\n\r\nI think we could solve this in a more scalable way by setting a community standard for code licensing. There could even be a little badge/icon with a gopher wearing a judge's wig.\r\n\r\n\u003e To provide a single package for a single purpose, and avoid duplicate effort.\r\n\r\nI'm concerned about what happens when better work is done elsewhere and then the package in /x atrophies. This already happened with websocket, where the package in /x/net is not the best implementation, but people use it because it's there. Efforts to replace it have stalledÂ for years. IMO, this is more evidence that the centralized repo approach does not scale.",
