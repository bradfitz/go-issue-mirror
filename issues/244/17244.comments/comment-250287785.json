Other languages have varying solutions of varying quality. None seem clearly better than what Go is doing, which is basically godoc.org.\r\n\r\nFor C++, [the Boost project](http://www.boost.org/) has served as a proving ground for libraries that might eventually make it into proposals for inclusion in the standard library. The libraries usually have to shrink (shedding features) and bend under the second phase of criticism from committee members. I've witnessed @davecheney preparing for this process with his [_pkg/errors_ library](https://github.com/pkg/errors).\r\n\r\nThe downside of an external proving ground like Boost is that people start using the \"outside\" version of the library, which is a necessary part of vetting it, and may never be able to afford to port to the \"standard\" version that makes it in much later. The world winds up with two versions in use, even when the goal was to only have one.\r\n",
