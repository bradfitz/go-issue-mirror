	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo 1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\namd64, Linux\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nin inotify_linux RemoveWatch does not remove from the registry of watches if Linux returns an error.\r\n\r\nI notify returns an error if you need to stop watching a directory, as it should because it automatically removes directories, but you still need to remove the registry because if the directory gets added back you need a new watcher reference id.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nwhen a directory is removed and added back files within the directory should return the full path name\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nIf a directory is removed and added just the file name with no path is returned for the Event.Name\r\n\r\n\r\nThe delete function just needs to be moved\r\nFix can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/jasonrichardsmith/exp/commit/6d6db11842483d91223ca57b2a462a39699e0249\r\n\r\n",
