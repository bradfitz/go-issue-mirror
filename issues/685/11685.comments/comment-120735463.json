	"body": "The build doesn't discard the options after the space character--you can see them in your gist in GOGCCFLAGS.  But you are correct that the build assumes that the first word in $CC is special, and that it doesn't need to keep the second work immediately after the first word as is true for something like \"ccache clang\".\r\n\r\nI doubt this will be fixed for the 1.5 release.  For now you will have to work around the problem, either by using a shell script or by omitting \"ccache\".  Frankly, \"ccache\" isn't buying you anything here, so I recommend omitting it until this is fixed.",
