	"body": "There's a handful of problems.\r\n\r\nFirst, in cmd/go when it sees a multifield CC value like \"ccache clang\", it resets CC=\"ccache\" and moves \"clang\" into GOGCCFLAGS.  (It also assumes it's able to insert arguments after the first field like \"ccache -I objdir clang\".)\r\n\r\nSecond, cmd/cgo doesn't use GOGCCFLAGS, so it doesn't see the \"clang\" argument.\r\n\r\nThird, when you run \"go env\", it runs mkEnv again based on the updated environment, so the \"clang\" string disappears completely from the output of `CC=\"ccache clang\" go env`, contrary to the environment actually provided to subtools.\r\n\r\nLastly, cmd/dist/test.go is currently written to assume `$CC` (and `go env CC`'s output; it uses both for some reason) is a single field string, and it *does* use `$GOGCCFLAGS`.",
