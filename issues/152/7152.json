	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nCurrently cmd/go requires a valid archChar (from go/build.ArchChar()). \n\nArchchars are only used for the gc compiler, not gccgo.\n\nGccgo is available on architectures that gc does not currently support, for example\nmips, arm64, but if cmd/go is compiled on those platforms it will refuse to run because\nbuild.ArchChar does not return a valid result.\n\nAs archChars are only valid when compiling with gc, I propose that cmd/go be modified to\nnot resolve the archChar during startup.\n\nPlease use labels and text to provide additional information.\u003c/pre\u003e",
