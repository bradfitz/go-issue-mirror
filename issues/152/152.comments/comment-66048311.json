Each name is exactly one\nor the other at any point in a program, regardless of\nsurrounding context.\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html#Declarations_and_scope\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html#Declarations_and_scope\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe actual grammar in a compiler would be \ndifferent - Expr = Expr \".\" Ident - but this is not the\nonly place where the grammar uses additional \nnames for clarity.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
