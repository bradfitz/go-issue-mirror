If I understand you correctly, the situation at the\nmoment is that as long as I'm compiling go on any kind of x86 CPU, I'm \"native\" and it\nwill be autodetected to whatever my CPU can handle? Whereas I assumed \"native\" meant I\nwas actually on a 32 bit CPU.\n\nThat said, do people really expect those instructions in 32 bit builds? I'm publishing\nbinary builds for a project of mine, it apparently breaks with SIGILL on a bunch of old\nor small (i.e. NAS) hardware out there. Most/all other binaries compiled for 32 bit x86\nseem to work fine, i.e. a regular Ubuntu and so on?\n\nI'll recompile everything with GO387=386 and see what happens.\u003c/pre\u003e",
