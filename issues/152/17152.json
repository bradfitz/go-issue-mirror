	"body": "Consider the following program:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreq, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"https://google.com\", nil)\r\ntrace := \u0026httptrace.ClientTrace{\r\n    DNSDone: func(dnsInfo httptrace.DNSDoneInfo) {\r\n        fmt.Printf(\"DNS Info: %#v\\n\", dnsInfo)\r\n    },\r\n}\r\nreq = req.WithContext(httptrace.WithClientTrace(req.Context(), trace))\r\nhttp.DefaultClient.Do(req)\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://google.com is redirected to https://www.google.com and making it harder to use the DNS hooks because DNSDoneInfo doesn't contain any information about the host it is trying to resolve.\r\n\r\nIt is also not documented anywhere that these hooks might be called more than once.\r\n\r\nShould we think about a way to report the redirection or include enough details, so the user can determine for which actual request, the hooks are being invoked?\r\n\r\n/cc @bradfitz ",
