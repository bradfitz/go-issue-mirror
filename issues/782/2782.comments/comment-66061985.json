I'm glad the RequestURI will address the needs here.\n\nI read the RFCs (2616 and 3986) again last night and I can't figure out\nwhere it says that URL-processing code must preserve the distinction\nbetween a path delimiter \"/\" and an encoded \"/\" in a path segment.\nJust for my own education, can you point out the relevant RFC and\nsection for me?  Thanks.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
