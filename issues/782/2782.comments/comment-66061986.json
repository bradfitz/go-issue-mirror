Percent-\n   encoding a reserved character, or decoding a percent-encoded octet\n   that corresponds to a reserved character, will change how the URI is\n   interpreted by most applications.  Thus, characters in the reserved\n   set are protected from normalization and are therefore safe to be\n   used by scheme-specific and producer-specific algorithms for\n   delimiting data subcomponents within a URI.\u003c/pre\u003e",
