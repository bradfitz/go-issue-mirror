Valgrind is really a tool for C programs.\nIt assumes it can replace malloc with its own copy, it assumes\nthe standard C stack model, I'm sure it assumes other things\nspecific to that world too.\n\nEqually important, Valgrind doesn't lend much benefit to Go.\nGo has no uninitialized variables and no dangling pointers.\n\nI understand that it could be useful for debugging problems\nwith cgo, but I'm not sure that it would be in practice.\n\nIf anyone wants to work on this, patches welcome.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-low**, **expertneeded**, removed **priority-medium**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **LongTerm**._",
