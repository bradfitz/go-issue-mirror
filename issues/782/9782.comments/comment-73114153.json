I feel this may be true, because the runtime doesn't know about the blocking call- but I don't know quite enough about the internals.\r\n\r\nAnyway, whatever the case, the Read can be interrupted by signals, and that error should probably be ignored instead of sending it over Error.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm.",
