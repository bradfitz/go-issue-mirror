	"body": "I looked at that a bit a few months back. The problem I ran into is that ld.Reloc has several more fields than goobj.Reloc but goobj.Sym has a slice of goobj.Relocs... I guess it's not that many really, so they could be added, but Xadd/Xsym don't really \"belong\" in goobj. The other thing is that goobj's struct have SymID's everywhere where ld has *LSyms, which IIRC ends up conflicting with the idea of using a symbol table in object files.",
