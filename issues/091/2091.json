The system works well, but not all\npackages can be built with the latest tip of golang. I was forced to switch back to the\nmost recent release of golang itself.\n\nIt seems to me that the defaults should all \u0026quot;just work\u0026quot;, and there should be a\nway to try everything with the latest code as well. It's impossible to guarantee that\nthe latest versions of packages are compatible with each other, let alone with the\nlatest version of golang. People seem to sync on the latest *release* of golang, but how\ndo we *know* which release of golang is expected?\n\nI was hoping at least to start a discussion. Or am I (and many package maintainers)\nsimply ignorant of some configuration settings?\u003c/pre\u003e",
