While I don't doubt that some certificates have encoding bugs, this isn't so prevalent that we should mirror the bug in Go. The fact that OpenSSL is lax is due to it's fundamental confusion between DER and BER going back many years. That's something that I'll have to remember to test when we update the certificate building in Chrome.",
