	"body": "LookupFieldOrMethod returns essentially the same information as a types.Selection, given the information present in a typed ast.SelectorExpr.  It would be nice if its type and its name related it to selections.  Perhaps something like this:\r\n\r\n// Select resolves a selection whose operand type is T and whose\r\n// selector is (pkg, name).  Addressable indicates that the operand is a variable of type T.\r\nfunc Select(T Type, addressable bool, pkg *Package, name string) types.Selection\r\n",
