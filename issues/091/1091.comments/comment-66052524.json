It was kind of ugly but I dropped this code into free: \n\n        // Find size class for v.\n        sizeclass = s-\u003esizeclass;\n(void)write(257, v, sizeclass);\n\nI then did this:\n\nstrace -e raw=write -e trace=write,mmap2 -o mx -f ./leak4 m /tmp/x\n\nIt confirmed what I expected: there are lots of calls to free (revealed by the write)\nbut no calls to free for memory allocated via mmap2. (I did not use a simple printf as\nthat confused some of the tests)\n\nI'll leave the rest to you experts.\u003c/pre\u003e",
