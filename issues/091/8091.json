This is convenient and seems like a\nreasonable rule of thumb.\n\ngofmt -w . \n\ndoes *not* honor this \u0026quot;rule\u0026quot;\n\nWith the ascendance of Godeps there are now Godeps/_workspace folders vendoring\ndependencies all over the place.  Having gofmt -w . rewrite my dependencies is painful. \nAny change the \u0026quot;ignore _\u0026quot; rule could be ported over to gofmt sometime soon? \nWould be happy to work on a pull request for this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
