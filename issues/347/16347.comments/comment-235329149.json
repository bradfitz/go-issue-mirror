	"body": "Interesting: The code I've shown above is from the current OpenSSL `master` branch. `nc_dns()` was changed via https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/77ff1f3b8bfaa348956c5096a2b829f2e767b4f1, after bug report [RT3562](https://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3562) (the 3662 cited in the commit is a typo). That change allowed leading dots in DNS name constraints, even though the RFC doesn't specifically allow it.\r\n\r\nSo @floridoo I'm essentially in agreement with you now. My previous understanding, that the dot MUST be present for a subdomain match, was incorrect.\r\n\r\n`crypto/x509` should do the same thing OpenSSL did, and allow the dots to be present, but not required.  I think https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16347#issuecomment-235190507 is quite messy, and this conditional is too complex to be one expression. The way OpenSSL does it looks much cleaner, IMO.",
