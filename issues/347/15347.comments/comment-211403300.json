	"body": "This makes writing easier, but I disagree that it makes reading easier in the common case. Your \"generic map\" function is not representative of the majority of Go code, and the interface keyword appears far less than one instance per line on average, even when you measure only function signatures. (You also could have written `type T interface{}` and used `T` and `[]T` throughout your signature)\r\n\r\nJavaScript code has proportionally more functions than Go has either functions or interfaces. Arguments for shortening the function syntax in that language may not apply with equal magnitude in this language.\r\n\r\nThe counter-point I find more compelling is that `func`-tion, `chan`-nel, `var`-iable are all fairly unambiguous prefixes in addition to being abbreviations. `iface` is not a prefix, thus has a different tone/feel when reading or discussing it. If `fn` had been chosen as the function keyword, I might not have this reservation.",
