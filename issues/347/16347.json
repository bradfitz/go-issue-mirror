	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n`go1.6.2`\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n`darwin/amd64`\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nA certificate with domain `test.example.com` is validated with an intermediate certificate having a name constraint of `.example.com`.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nThe certificate chain should be valid. A name constraint `.example.com` should allow all subdomains of example.com, but not the domain itself (according to the [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.10)).\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nThe certificate chain is not considered valid (`x509: a root or intermediate certificate is not authorized to sign in this domain`), while `test..example.com` works.\r\nThe problem is the check at https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/x509/verify.go#L172, that enforces a `.` as the last character of the domain prefix (that's why `test..example.com` is considered valid).\r\n\r\n",
