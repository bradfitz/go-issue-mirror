Can there be something\nthat exports the total count?\n\nEg, we had a process that was regularly creating/destroying more than 10,000 goroutines\na second, but the working set size is always about 3,000.  The creation rate was both\nunexpected and a performance problem.  There's not currently a convenient way to extract\nthis information.\u003c/pre\u003e",
