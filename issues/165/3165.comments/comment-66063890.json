I have done lots of programming using mac (iOS apps etc.) but have\nnever come across procmod. So, the sentence \"must be installed setgrp procmod\" is not\njust difficult to understand but imho wrong grammatically.\n\nI am not trying to offend you, but I believe this string should be reviewed by a native\nEnglish speaker. Thanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
