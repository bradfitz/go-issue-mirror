So I will try to comment your code without actually running it. So I could be wrong about many things.\r\n\r\nYour golang test.cpp:15 (init function) starts new thread, and new thread (timeProc function) calls Go callback. That will not work. The syscall.NewCallback can only be called by the no-Go code that is called by syscall.Syscall (or syscall.(*Proc).Call) before it return back to Go.\r\n\r\nAlso your DLL functions must use standard calling conventions: stdcall on 386 and \"whatever Windows uses\" on amd64. Your C build tool must generate appropriate code for both init and goCallback.\r\n\r\nAlso syscall.Syscall and syscall.NewCallback both align its parameters and return value on 4 bytes for 386 and 8 bytes for amd64. Does your C build tool does the same? You need to make sure it does.\r\n\r\nI hope it helps.\r\n\r\nAlex",
