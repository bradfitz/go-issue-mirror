	"body": "I just ran into this building on Debian (go1.3.3). This bug can even affect build machines that try to use a clean GOPATH, if they use `go get` to assemble it, because `go get` implicitly runs a build with no tags. I think this is severe enough that the documentation for `-tags` needs a warning about using it without `-a`.",
