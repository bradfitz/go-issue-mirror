First, if the goroutine creation does not show up in the CPU\nprofile, then it is not a problem; otherwise it's discoverable with CPU profiler.\nSecond, we can't add counters for all operations in runtime; CPU and memory profilers\nare generic tools that uncover all issues of such kind.\u003c/pre\u003e",
