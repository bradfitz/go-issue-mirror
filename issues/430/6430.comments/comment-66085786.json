The cloning URL copy pasted rigth\nfrom the project's page is \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql.git\"\u003ehttps://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql.git\u003c/a\u003e, so the import\npath is clearly \"github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql\".\n\n2. Cloning the repo doesn't require a username nor password. Perhaps Github, because\ncase sensitiviy is not a bug, assumes Go-SQL-Driver is a private account.\n\n3. The linked issue is _not_ a github.com issue tracker.\n\nWhy a problem, introduced solely by user's error, should be treated by adding a\n\"feature\" which just undoes that very error?\n\n#WorkingAsIntended\u003c/pre\u003e",
