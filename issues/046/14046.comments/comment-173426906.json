	"body": "Looks like this was caused by @rsc's change to NumGoroutine in fac8202. GoroutineProfile checks that the caller passed in enough room for NumGoroutine() stacks and then iterates over allgs to collect stacks, but since NumGoroutine() now omits system goroutines, it will return less than the number of Gs in allgs. If the slice passed in by the caller is big enough for non-system goroutines, but too small for all goroutines, GoroutineProfile will panic.",
