It handles predeclared types, like eg. string, and probably some others. The argument to `panic` is converted to an `interface{}`, I think the two numbers printed are the two items in the `interface{}` runtime `struct {*typeInfo, *value}`.\r\n\r\nFTR: converting the argument to `string` makes the trace look more usual: http://play.golang.org/p/einqqW9zTp",
