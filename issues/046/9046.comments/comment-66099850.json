The *os.File to which it points is\neventually collected, and the finalizer closes the file descriptor.  There is nothing\nkeeping tty live, so it is hard to blame the compiler.  This would be more obvious if\nthe function were\n\nfunc ttyFd() uintptr {\n    tty, _ := os.Open(\"/dev/tty\")\n    return tty.Fd()\n}\n\nI think our choices are 1) document that you must be careful to keep the *os.File live\nif you call the Fd method; 2) have the Fd method clear the finalizer, and document that\nthe caller of Fd is responsible for closing the descriptor, somehow--actually this would\nprobably require adding a new function to close a descriptor.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.4maybe**, removed **release-go1.4**._",
