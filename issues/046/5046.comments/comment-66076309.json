We document the\nguarantees we DO make.\n\nYou _can_ reproduce this in a test in the standard library with the fakeDB in\nfakedb_test.go.  Just make it log calls to a public slice of events, and have a test\nwhich clears that slice, does some actions (open + prepare + exec + close + whatever),\nand then stringify the slice of events, looking for the right order.\n\nNow that we have the dependency track stuff, this should be easy to \"fix\" (or start\nguaranteeing) if you can write a stand-alone test.\n\nYou don't have much time, though.\u003c/pre\u003e",
