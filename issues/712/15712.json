What did you do?\r\n\r\nbug: [`bufio/scan/scan.go`, line 202.](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/bufio/scan.go#L202)\r\n\r\nIt is not necessarily to `continue`, as in the next iteration, none of the codes earlier needs to be touched. It creates unnecessarily overheads to run splitFunc without filling up data from `reader`, first.\r\n\r\nI have ran `scan_test.go` without `continue`, to my surprise, they are all passed! At the very least, if it belongs there, they should add a test case that shows it. I'm generally of the opinion that if small-but-severe changes to the code don't cause tests to fail, the tests are incomplete.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, removing a `continue` definitely qualifies. \r\n\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
