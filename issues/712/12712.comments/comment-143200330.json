	"body": "There's nothing special about the server's reply. It's just an error code 2 SERVFAIL which triggers the \"server misbehaving\" branch in net/dnsclient.go:answer(). The answer() function is called for each of the queries attempted during lookup (i.e. for each entry in search) and as currently implemented the last error propagates up to be the return from LookupIP(). So for regression testing, just set up your test DNS server to reply SERVFAIL for each query that ends in a certain subdomain and list that subdomain in resolv.conf's search line. Once this issue is fixed, it should no longer matter if the broken subdomain is listed first or last and unless the argument to LookupIP() explicitly includes the broken subdomain, the SERVFAIL should never propagate up.",
