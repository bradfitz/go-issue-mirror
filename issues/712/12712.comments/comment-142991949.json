I'm not the original designer of LookupIP but I guess he wanted to make LookupIP easier for name-to-address mapping traversal. If you think of having a new API (sorry, we cannot change the behavior of LookupIP because it works as a stub resolver for helping Dial) for some purpose, please follow the procedure: https://github.com/golang/proposal#readme\r\n\r\nThank you.",
