Go fails with \u0026quot;unknown marker\u0026quot; because the \u0026quot;\\xff\\x00\u0026quot; is\ninterpreted as a marker instead of a 0 byte for the Huffman decoder. I'm not sure yet if\nthe image is actually spec-compliant or if libjpeg is being liberal in what it accepts.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4705/0/sample.jpg\"\u003esample.jpg\u003c/a\u003e (5063 bytes)",
