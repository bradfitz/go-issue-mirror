Why does clang default to -gdwarf-2?\r\n\r\nI'll note that it's also pointless to issue a warning about a .note section, particularly a .note.GNU-stack section.  The warning may be harmless but it's completely pointless.  Those sections are essentially required on GNU/Linux, and have no contents so the lack of debug info is irrelevant.",
