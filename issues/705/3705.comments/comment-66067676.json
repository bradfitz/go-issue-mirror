I think we should have a compiler flag -X\nthat means 'there are no external (non-Go) files in this package', and if that flag is\nset, complain about forward declarations as if they were not part of the language.\n\nThen the go command can invoke 6g with -X when it knows there are no non-Go files in the\npackage.\u003c/pre\u003e",
