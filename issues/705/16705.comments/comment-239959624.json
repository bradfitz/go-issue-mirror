In both cases, the faulting workbuf address is pretty similar to the good workbuf address passed to handoff (within 1.8MB and 576KB, respectively), further indicating that this isn't just a bogus pointer.\r\n\r\n2. getempty has two code paths. If getempty returned an existing buffer from the work.empty list, it would *also* have read b1.nobj and should have crashed earlier, so we presumably didn't take this path. Hence, we must have just persistentalloc'd the buffer. This also means the funny lock-free list code isn't involved. Also, the distance between the buffers means they came from different persistentalloc chunks.\r\n\r\n3. I was mistaken about the 4K alignment. workbufs are actually only 64 byte aligned (+ 16 bytes for the field offset). The 4K alignment could indicate that persistentalloc just mmap'ed this memory, but if we're persistentalloc'ing a bunch of workbufs and nothing else, I would expect half of them to be 4K aligned anyway.",
