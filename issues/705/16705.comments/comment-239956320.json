A SIGSEGV would mean we just followed a bad pointer, but a SIGBUS indicates that we somehow wound up in a truncated file mapping. Furthermore, the pointer has the proper 4K alignment + 16 bytes in both tracebacks, which is unlikely to happen by accident, further indicating that these were valid workbuf pointers. It almost seems like a file got mapped *over* our workbuf allocation, but AFAIK nothing in the standard library or commands ever mmaps a file.",
