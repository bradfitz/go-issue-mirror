	"body": "I added a probe when we preempt the backgroundgc goroutine. 5 out of 5 times I've run it there's been an involuntary preemption of the GC startup operation that takes a long time and lets the heap overflow. It's hard to say if this is cause or effect—the preemption could be happening because we're taking too long to do an operation—but when it happens it certainly exacerbates the situation since the large number of runnable goroutines in this test means the GC goroutine won't get rescheduled for some time.",
