We're not supposed to be sweeping *any* spans (and usually we\n\u003e don't). This suggests that some accounting is off and it's throwing off\n\u003e both the sweep ratio and the assist ratio. This sweeping is also bad for\n\u003e the mutator yielding trick because mutators that are allocating wind up\n\u003e yielding a lot during this sweep process.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/11911#issuecomment-126504297\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
