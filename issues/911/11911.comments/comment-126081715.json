I don't know what's causing this, since this program doesn't obviously use anything else that would be acquiring worldsema.\r\n\r\nI've seen other causes, too, though. In one run, it took 86ms to get from the Gosched in startGC to the actually running the GC goroutine. I suspect the GC goroutine got kicked out of or stolen from runnext or delayed by something considered higher priority by schedule.",
