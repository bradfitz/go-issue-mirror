If you know of any pointer-typed handles, please send a CL changing them to uintptr.\n\nI will add a GODEBUG=invalidptr=0 setting to disable to check as a temporary workaround\nfor people, but the right fix is to fix the code. The workaround may not be enough in\nfuture releases.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
