	"body": "This issue proposes that Go should support some form of generic programming.\r\nIt has the Go2 label, since for Go1.x the language is more or less done. \r\n\r\nAccompanying this issue is [a general generics proposal](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/15292-generics.md) by @ianlancetaylor that includes four specific flawed proposals of generic programming mechanisms for Go.\r\n\r\nThe intent is not to add generics to Go at this time, but rather to show people what a complete proposal would look like. We hope this will be of help to anyone proposing similar language changes in the future.",
