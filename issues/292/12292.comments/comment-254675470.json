Yes, it's a simple implementation. But a) having to look this procedure up costs your users time, b) having to reimplement, maintain, and test this function costs your users more time, and c) if 1,000 developers implement this on their own, at least one of these implementations will have a bug.\r\n\r\nWhy not just implement this once, and save your users a pointless duplication of time and effort?",
