	"body": "The generics design we came up with for Genus has static, modular type checking, does not require predeclaring that types implement some interface, and comes with reasonable performance. I would definitely look at it if you're thinking about generics for Go. It does seem like a good fit from my understanding of Go.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the paper that doesn't require ACM Digital Library access:\r\nhttp://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/papers/genus/\r\n\r\nThe Genus home page is here: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/genus/\r\n\r\nWe haven't released the compiler publicly yet, but we are planning to do that fairly soon.\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any questions people have.\r\n",
