We used to have various hand-holding\nerrors in go/build and they turned out to be infinitely confusing\nwhen they were wrong.  I deleted them all during the go/build\nrewrite.\n\nTo apply to the current case, suppose we printed something\nabout 'you don't have Mercurial installed; run this' when in\nfact they do have Mercurial installed, it's just not in their path.\nLet's let the error say what it knows and not assume it knows more.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
