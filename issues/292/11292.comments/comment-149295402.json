	"body": "I see two ways to fix that issue:\r\n 1. As I said in the previous message, add a new WordEncoder to Q-encode in a \"phrase\" context (ie. names in address fields).\r\n 2. Use base64 encoding when the names in addresses use the additional characters that need to be encoded.\r\n\r\nSolution 1 code will feel a bit hacky since WordEncoder underlying type is byte. We will need to add a new const like `QPhraseEncoder = WordEncoder('Q')`.\r\nSolution 2 is simpler, adds no new API and this is what Gmail do for example.\r\n\r\n@bradfitz is solution 2 ok?\r\n\r\n",
