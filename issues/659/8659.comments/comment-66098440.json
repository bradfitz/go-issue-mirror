I think you're suggesting that when there is a\ntype mismatch between the type of the composite literal and its elements that we should\nreport the error on the type rather than the elements.  But sometimes that will be wrong\ntoo.  How can we know where it would be better to report an error?  It's not a\nrhetorical question; if you can suggest a simple algorithm, perhaps we can implement it.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **release-none**._",
