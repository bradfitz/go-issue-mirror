I'm suggesting that we\ncheck that the type of the field and the element match before checking that values\nwithin the element are correct. In the example code:\n\ntype Foo struct{\n    Elem [][]float64\n}\n\nfunc main(){\n    _ = Foo{\n          Elem: []float64{ // other code},\n      }\n}\n\nthis code is wrong no matter what \"other code\" contains, because Elem has type\n[][]float64, but the value has type []float64. I'm suggesting that this be checked\nbefore checking that the types within \"// other code\" are correct.\u003c/pre\u003e",
