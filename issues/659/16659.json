What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"darwin\"\r\nGOOS=\"darwin\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nWe have a router using the ReverseProxy. The application was sending back content with a Content-Length but stopping before all the body data was transmitted.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nI would have expected an error to be logged when we get the UnexpectedEOF during io.CopyBuffer\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\n",
