	"body": "My main concern, before I can start to think about others, is that of the import paths. As I understand `example.com/foo/bar/vendor/example.com/foo/baz` is not a valid import path. `example.com/foo/baz` is a valid import path of a Go package that happens to be vendored inside `example.com/foo/bar`.\r\n\r\nAre other people okay with the idea that `go list all` will print out a bunch of invalid import paths (in addition to valid ones)? How should other tools deal with these invalid import paths?\r\n\r\nI thought the point of vendoring was to put a copy of the original package (e.g., `example.com/foo/baz`) inside your VCS tree, but not _change_ it in any way. No import path rewriting required - the vendored package still has the same original import path. You should be able to vendor/not vendor any package as you wish. It seems to do that but also change import paths of the packages being vendored.",
