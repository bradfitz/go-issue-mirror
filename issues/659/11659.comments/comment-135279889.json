	"body": "@davecheney I understand you are saying using \"_vendor\", which existing go tool will ignore, will result in fewer support requests to package authors. But the same is true for the go 1.5 tool as well in the context of this issue because `go test ./...` and `go install ./...` will also do the same thing as older versions. So while I think I understand what you are saying, I don't follow your logic.\r\n\r\nIt would appear you think that tools shouldn't exclude test files should the author request it. Is that true? Could you explain why?\r\n",
