	"body": "The fact that everyone is proposing workarounds just points to the fact that this should be fixed.  Renaming it to _vendor *just works*.  If you want to test or install stuff from your vendor directory, you can by just cd'ing into that directory.... but if you don't want to, then you can `go whatever ./...` just like you do today, and it'll work just like it does today.  Making it \"vendor\" **breaks things**.  I can't imagine anyone wanting that to be the default.\r\n\r\nKeep go simple.  Make the vendor directory _vendor so that tools skip it.  I shouldn't have to use some annoyingly arcane command to just build and test my code.",
