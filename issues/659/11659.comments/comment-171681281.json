	"body": "@rsc Please don't qualify it as an \"easy\" workaround. It's a dirty workaround for something that should work out-of-the-box. Why? Because someone decided that the Go tool should deal with vendoring, and since it does, the default way should correspond to the most intuitive and common approach. The workaround should be required if you do something out of the ordinary, like testing dependencies on each build or, like you mention, customizing dependencies. In that case, a workaround (i.e. cd vendor \u0026\u0026 go test ./...) seems perfectly fine. I don't understand why you argue to make the default more annoying in favour of some edge cases. One of the most wonderful things about Go is that defaults usually work in intuitive ways and hardly ever annoy me.",
