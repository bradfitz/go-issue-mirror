For ex, I've written a super crappy one to copy packages from $GOPATH to ./vendor so I can get by: https://github.com/pressly/gv ..which I trigger through a Makefile like in https://github.com/pressly/imgry.\n\n.. the challenge is, once a tool prepares the vendor directory, how will that tool fix go test ./... ? Try to design one and offer some suggestions\n\n\n\n\n\u003e On Aug 26, 2015, at 6:34 PM, Daniel Theophanes \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e \n\u003e Honest question: Do people plan to vendor packages by hand?\n\u003e \n\u003e If they do, these questions have merit. If they plan to use a tool, let the tool do the work after the developer decides what they want to test and what they want to not test. Some will want to run dependency tests especially when if multi-platform. Others may decide they don't want the tests. Then the default behavior falls out.\n\u003e \n\u003e Do people really not want to make their tools do this work?\n\u003e \n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n\u003e \n",
