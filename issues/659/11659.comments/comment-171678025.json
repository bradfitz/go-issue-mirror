My point is that it may also be appropriate or\nworthwhile to include those tests, so it is not appropriate for ./... to\ncategorically exclude certain directories. Different people use vendor\ndifferently. Some people do make local changes, or do want to include it in\n\"go vet ./...\" or other commands.\n\nI also still think that for the specific case of testing, if we could solve\ntest caching then that would help considerably.\n",
