	"body": "Including `./vendor/` in wildcard commands like `go list ./...` significantly increases the duration of the command when there are a lot of dependencies (obviously).\r\n\r\nWhile I agree with @rsc that wildcards are wildcards and vendoring is vendoring, including dependencies in a wildcard seems like a significant unintended consequence.\r\n\r\nI like the aesthetics of using `./vendor/` as well, but think that the functionality of `./_vendor` is what people coming from previous vendoring projects, like `godep`, are expecting.\r\n\r\nI guess my suggestion is that if `$GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1` then `./vendor` *should* be treated specially and excluded from wildcards.",
