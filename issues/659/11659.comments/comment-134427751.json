	"body": "I do not want tests / main packages in `vendor/` compiled or executed when `./...` is specified, but any packages contained inside of vendor searched and used as necessary. My main motivation for this is so that building / testing can be done simply at the repo level (`go install -v ./...` \u0026 `go test -v ./...`) w/o having to specify the local packages to build / test via Makefiles or similar means.\r\n\r\nI do not want to have to rely on a specific vendoring tool to accomplish this either. I don't think go should require a specific vendoring tool. (PS:  I applaud govendor / @kardianos for implementing so much.)\r\n\r\nIf I want to run the tests for my vendored dependencies (which I sometimes do), I do that by checking out a version, reading their docs and running their tests in whatever manner is necessary. Sometimes it's not as simple as `go test -v ./...`, but I think we should strive to make it that easy. **ALWAYS**.\r\n\r\nRenaming `vendor/` to `_vendor/` I believe accomplished this and IMO is the path to least surprise for users.",
