	"body": "Removing the ability to test your dependencies entirely is not the same as having the ability to not test them.\r\n\r\nAs a CI user I would want to be able run a minimal set of tests for pull requests that won't hit production, to give me a good feeling that this PR doesn't break existing functionality.\r\n\r\nHowever, before doing a build that would hit a prod server I want the ability to do a full regression of all the sub packages. To make sure that we aren't deploying a version of a dependency that has failing tests.\r\n\r\nI also would like to be able to this while being able to keeping the command simple, and not having to explicitly list each dependency, as having to enter our CI tool to update the build scripts on every change would not be ideal.\r\n\r\nI would be fine / great with making it a requirement that if you wanted to skip vendored tests that you must use `go list` to feed the `go test` list of packages. `go test ./...` would be the method of running all tests, including the vendored ones.",
