	"body": "by **crazy1be**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThis bug still exists on the latest go (ran hg pull -u).\n\nI noticed this error because i use go for a reverse http proxy. Go reads the cookie or\nset-cookie headers correctly, but calling resp.Write() yeilds an incorrect escaping of\nthe URL.\n\nAfter digging for hours through various parts of my code, I determined it must be a bug\nin the library. Then, i searched through the library for a while, before finally finding\nthe bug! Volia!\n\nIncidentally, the cookie *still works* in chrome, it is able to figure out that the path\nis URLEscaped. However, many other browsers are not able to figure this out, and they\nshould not have to. This is incorrect behaviour.\n\nWhat are the steps to reproduce the problem?\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\u0026quot;os\u0026quot;\n\t\u0026quot;http\u0026quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tresp, _, _ := http.Get(\u0026quot;\u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com\u0026quot\"\u003ehttp://www.google.com\u0026quot\u003c/a\u003e;)\n\tresp.Write(os.Stdout)\n}\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nSet-Cookie: foo=bar; path=/\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nSet-Cookie: foo=bar; path=%2F\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux x86\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n9f27edac5018 tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThe issue is on line 191 of src/pkg/http/cookie.go.\n\nCurrent: fmt.Fprintf(\u0026amp;b, \u0026quot;Path=%s\u0026quot;, URLEscape(c.Path))\nShould be: fmt.Fprintf(\u0026amp;b, \u0026quot;Path=%s\u0026quot;, c.Path)\n\nThere may be some other escaping you want to do, in order to ensure that e.g. semicolons\nare properly encoded. However, whatever encoding function you use should *not* encode /\nas %2f.\u003c/pre\u003e",
