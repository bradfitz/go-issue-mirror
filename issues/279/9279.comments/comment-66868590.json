This is an extreme corner case, involving two odd cases:\r\n\r\n* you have imports where the import path base doesn't match the package name\r\n* you're hacking on a project without its dependencies already installed.\r\n\r\nNone of those happen often. If it does, you can use your version control system to revert to where you were, run `git get .` to get the necessary dependencies, and start again.\r\n",
