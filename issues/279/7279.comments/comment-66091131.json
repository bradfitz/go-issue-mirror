I've mailed \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/64010043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/64010043\u003c/a\u003e for\nreview. Sadly handling this is subtle but it doesn't mess up the code too much.\n\nI've confirmed that it can now process the buggy input referenced in #1 and produces the\nsame output as bzip2 from the command line.\u003c/pre\u003e",
