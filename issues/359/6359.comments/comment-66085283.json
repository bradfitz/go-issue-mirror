In the issue tracker I only see one request (for Round). \n\nI don't think it has to be a binary (some additional functions can be added without\nadding all possible functions). Erfinv and Erfcinv are a good fit for the math package\nbecause they\n a) compliment functions aleady in the math package (right now you can use the math package to compute the cumulative distribution of a Gaussian at x but not inverse problem of finding the x which gives that cdf) and \nand\nb) are not a one or two line function to implement (erf and erfc combine for about 200\nlines of code)\u003c/pre\u003e",
