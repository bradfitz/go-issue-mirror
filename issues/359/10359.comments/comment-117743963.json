	"body": "It appears gdb.error was introduced in GDB 7.3. I'm kind of surprised the test even gets that far in 7.2. Since 7.3 was released in July of 2011, I'm happy to say \"we don't support GDB \u003c 7.3\", but please reopen if you disagree. I would add a version check to runtime-gdb.py, but there appears to be no way to get the running GDB version from the Python API other than redirecting and parsing the rather verbose output of \"show version\".",
