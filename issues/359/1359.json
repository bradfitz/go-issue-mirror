	"body": "by **danielarndt**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIt appears that reading from stdin is not handled in the same way the C is. I understand\nGo is not C, however I was under the impression (and so were others in IRC) that Go\nhandles these fundamental things similarily.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Produce two programs, one in C and one in Go using scanf/Scanf to read in an integer.\n\n2. Compile and run these programs\n3. Give as input \u0026quot;1 2\u0026quot;\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nIdentical handling of the input.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\ntdnrad ~ $ gcc testStdin.c\ntdnrad ~ $ 6g testStdin.go \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 6l testStdin.6\ntdnrad ~ $ ./a.out \nEnter a number: 1 2\nYou have entered 1.\ntdnrad ~ $ ./6.out \nEnter a number: 1 2\nYou have entered 1.\ntdnrad ~ $ 2\n-bash: 2: command not found\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nTested both 6g and 8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nTested on Gentoo Linux (6g) and Linux Mint (8g). \n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n6g: 23006c94f1aa tip\n8g: 61b2c52b0d22 tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nAs you can see, the additional integer entered is used as the next command in the Go\nimplementation, but not in the C implementation. I first noticed this when developing a\ncommand-line driven program a while back (it got quite annoying, but I figured I hadn't\nnoticed it back when I programmed C. Now upon programming again in C I have noticed this\nisn't the case.) \n\nAttached is two simple programs showing the difference.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1359/0/testStdin.c\"\u003etestStdin.c\u003c/a\u003e (143 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1359/0/testStdin.go\"\u003etestStdin.go\u003c/a\u003e (146 bytes)",
