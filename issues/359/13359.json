	"body": "The commit d96a3a2d113909a470d2fd039018e1852a8d72b8 makes hostname entries in local database lowercase forcibly during go1.6 development. I don't think it's a good idea because /etc/hosts-like local database is a last resort for name resolution and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4343 never says that \"don't preserve case on input and output\" for some reasons; perhaps it was for internetworking with old-plain systems and it is just for future use.\r\n\r\nI don't see any rationale for the change in d96a3a2d113909a470d2fd039018e1852a8d72b8, so can you please restore the behavior that preserves case on input and output?\r\n\r\nNote that we know a few name resolver libraries don't preserve case of hostnames and DNS labels, for example libc for OS X/iOS that supports both unicast and multicast DNS, but I still don't think we need to do case conversion for now especially with inconsistency that providing case-converted hostnames and case-preserved DNS labels.",
