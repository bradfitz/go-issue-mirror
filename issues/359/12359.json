It works for go build, but not for go test, which gives me the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go test -c -buildmode=\"archive\" ./\r\n# testmain\r\ninvalid value \"\" for flag -buildmode: invalid buildmode: \"\"\r\nusage: link [options] main.o\r\n  -B note\r\n    \tadd an ELF NT_GNU_BUILD_ID note when using ELF\r\n[...]\r\n```",
