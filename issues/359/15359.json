	"body": "Cross posting this issue from the mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/IfEhzW_mmV4) in accordance with the contributing doc (I'm still unsure what the usual procedure is here; should I really be posting things in two places?):\r\n\r\nRight now if you import the `x/net/trace` package you wind up with the\r\nside effect that `net/http`'s `DefaultServeMux` has handlers for\r\n`/debug/requests` and `/debug/events` registered on it. The only mention\r\nof this side effect in the docs is a somewhat unclear statement right\r\nat the start:\r\n\r\n\u003e Package trace implements tracing of requests and long-lived objects. It exports HTTP interfaces on /debug/requests and /debug/events.\r\n\r\nTo me, this was very confusing. I did not take that statement to mean\r\nthat the package implicitly registers the handlers, but that this was\r\nbehavior you could achieve with the package (eg. maybe there's a\r\n`RegisterHandlers` function that registers those two handlers).\r\n\r\nI've put in a CL to make the documentation clearer\r\n(https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/22208/1) but I'd also like to\r\npropose that this \"feature\" be removed.\r\n\r\nImplicitly setting up the handlers on package import violates Go's\r\nprincipal of least suprise; in my case, that was just a panic and a\r\nfew minutes of me starting blankly at a screen wondering how the\r\nhandler I was registering could already be registered, but in someone\r\nelses case it could involve a route to their debugging info being\r\nexposed to the public (because they only thought to put authorization\r\nor authentication in front of the /trace route which is where they\r\nexplicitly exposed the trace handler after importing this package).\r\n\r\nIn the elegant words of one of my coworkers when we discovered this\r\nbehavior: \"that is a pretty gross side effect\".
