(I came across this bug independently). Once I had my change (to the golang.org/x/tools repo), and the matching change to the main Go repo, it seemed faster to send both of my changes out instead of reviewing yours, especially as your new code differed from the StructTag.Get code in the standard reflect package and I'd prefer them to be similar.\r\n\r\nApologies for having your proposal fall through the cracks.",
