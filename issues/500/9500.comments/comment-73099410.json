I see it here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/golang-codereviews/2974/golang-codereviews/hVZNIPvazNY/YISaX9QxKbkJ .\r\n\r\nI think the main issue is that no reviewer was assigned and nobody happened to pick it up.  For 3952 Nigel assigned Rob as the reviewer when he sent it out, so Rob got it in direct mail, and reviewed it quickly.\r\n\r\nThat is, CL 2974 would have been reviewed at some point, but 3952 was reviewed quickly because it was sent directly to the reviewer.",
