If not, ok is false and elem is the zero value for the\nmap's element type.\n\nSimilarly, when reading from a map if the key is not present the result is the zero\nvalue for the map's element type.\u0026quot;\n\nThey say the same thing with very similar words, making one to think that maybe the\nsecond paragraph is actually an errata and it was supposed to explain something else.\u003c/pre\u003e",
