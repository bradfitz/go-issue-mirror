What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n \r\ndarwin/amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nRan `go tool pprof -base ./howsmyssl-1.heap -inuse_objects` and then `web`. Then also, `-png` from the command line. This is with graphviz 2.38.0_3 installed via MacPorts.\r\n\r\nWhen doing so, my arrows are often very fat, sometimes to the point of obscuring the boxes they connect.\r\n\r\nThe most egregious of these I caught as an SVG and is here (github won't allow the upload directly on this ticket): https://gist.github.com/jmhodges/72869f007b58f527595766487add4af0\r\n\r\nHere is a less obvious example that I managed to capture as a PNG. ![fairlyfatarrows](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/598/14938761/47319b44-0ee3-11e6-905b-f00e525144b2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
