But I have seen all sorts of errors when reading all registry keys of various computers. People run all sorts of programs they download from Internet - buggy and shifty. These programs are free to do whatever they like with your registry - they have all your rights (more often then not administrator rights).\r\n\r\nSo I do not consider failing TestWalkFullRegistry to be a problem. I have added the test while I was developing package functionality, and left it in because it is helpful sometimes to debug things. But it is only running during \"go test -short\", so we ignore any registry inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nPlease, reopen if you disagree.\r\n\r\nAlex",
