	"body": "The GC has a STW mark checker that preforms a second STW mark phase after\r\nthe concurrent mark phase is complete. If the STW marker encounters an\r\nobject that the Concurrent marker missed it throws. Typically this is due\r\nto some write barrier not being properly called and these reports are of\r\ngreat value in focusing our attention to where the missing write barriers\r\nmight be. Let us know if they are preventing you from making progress and\r\nwe will implement a mechanism to turn off the concurrent GC until we can\r\nfind and fix the misssing write barriers.\r\n\r\nOn Sun, Dec 14, 2014 at 8:47 AM, Brad Fitzpatrick \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\r\nwrote:\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e /cc @rsc \u003chttps://github.com/rsc\u003e\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e â€”\r\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\r\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/9309#issuecomment-66913728\u003e.\r\n\u003e",
