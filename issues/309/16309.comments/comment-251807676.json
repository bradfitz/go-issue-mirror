	"body": "How is that a breaking change? It is already the case that Cgo code may call C functions with either a single or a single plus error result. Code that is already written to not \"request\" the error result from `C.malloc` will continue to work just the same as other code for C language functions that don't care to pick up the error result. Code that currently won't work if _written as documented_, would become compilable.\r\n\r\nPlease explain how this is an incompatible change?",
