I don't think anyone's proposing changing the behavior in this case (including the panic behavior). This just adds the possibility to call it with two return values. The only oddity would be that, presumably, we would still want it to panic in the zero or one case, and not panic in the two case. This is different from other C functions, but not without precedent in the language (e.g., one- versus two-assignment type assertions).",
