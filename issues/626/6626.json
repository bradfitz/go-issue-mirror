	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI was investigating why some code was taking a noticeable (260ms)\ntime to run, and found that it was because it was calling tls.X509KeyPair\na few times.\n\nThe time taken by tls.X509KeyPair is dominated by the time\ntaken by rsa.PrivateKey.Validate, which is itself dominated\nby the probabilistic prime test, which takes ~30ms. Since the\ntest is not that great (cf. the comment in the function), perhaps\nwe could lose it.\n\nThe time taken by the code in my test case dropped\nto 50ms with that test removed, with X509KeyPair no longer\nbeing the dominant factor.\n\ngo version go1.2rc2 linux/amd64\u003c/pre\u003e",
