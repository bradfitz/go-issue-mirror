What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI found that the archive/zip package release realization is uncompleted. \r\nI want to append a dir or some files into an exists zip file without unzip it, but the functions are not supported.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nI use the exec.Command to call `zip -r` command in the system. may be is not the good way.\r\nI hope the next version archive/zip will support it.\r\n",
