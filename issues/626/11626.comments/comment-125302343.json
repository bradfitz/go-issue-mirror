I'll check other spell checking software for the same behavior.\r\n\r\neven a google search suggests that 'cancelation' may be wrong, and suggests searching the term 'cancellation' instead. It doesn't behave the same with the other inflected variants of cancel.\r\n\r\nwiktionary makes a case for cancelation but doesn't cite anything. the discussion page mentions rules within the language forbidding the long form but again doesn't cite anything. So now I'm investigating such rules.\r\nhttps://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cancelation\r\n\r\nhowever, using ngrams I have access to a data set with millions of entries that convey just the opposite.\r\n\r\nLike I said before, it is a matter of taste, I'm just making the argument for commonality among existing American/British English work.\r\n\r\nI really don't care what form is used, i just find this an interesting topic. It just happened to start in an issue regarding golang.",
