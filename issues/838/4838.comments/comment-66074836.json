However, in \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/3790\"\u003eissue #3790\u003c/a\u003e the problem is to\nrecognize actual abbreviations that people use. In this issue, the abbreviations are\nfakes that we have created because Windows won't give us the real ones. Perhaps we\nshould fix this issue by doing a better job at abbreviating. If the 200 or so lines in\nAlex's attachment are really all the possible time zones, then we should be able to\nwrite a better abbreviator with the necessary cases to handle them all correctly.\n\nThe worst abbreviation we have now is \"UTC+10\" =\u003e \"UTC\". That should probably stay\n\"UTC+10\", but we should also probably make package time recognize that as an\nabbreviation. I'll add a note about that case to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/3790\"\u003eissue #3790\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e",
