	"body": "I see this issue on a regular basis for machines that still have free physical memory (certainly enough for the process I would like to invoke), but are being called by a Go process with a very large virtual memory footprint using `os.Exec`. The invocation fails due to insufficient virtual memory to fork the parent Go process. I think calling this a \"performance\" issue isn't accurate.\r\n\r\nGo daemons with large virtual memory footprints needing to invoke small command-line utilities is a common use case. It would be nice to get this assigned to the 1.5 release.",
