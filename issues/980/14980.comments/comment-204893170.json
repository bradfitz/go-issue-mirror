	"body": "Frequent write sharing can be very expensive and prevent scaling on higher core counts. We need to get rid of each and every case.\r\nBut note that processors don't have circuitry to distinguish between false and true sharing. They penalize both equally. So it is not about adding padding and shuffling variables, it is about elimination of frequently written to variables. You can see the following changes for examples:\r\nd6ed1b70ade474a901eb5deaf00e536d26a6ccd6\r\nd839a809b22a6e7b1b434917bdc48caac32507e8\r\n66d5c9b1e9c30908608469f30b0bb72cb3014600\r\n909f31872a0e5e5b8ec5cc49b22ae661777a2fbc\r\n013ad89c9bc5c2903c535d217af242063c797251\r\nc9152a8568fd49b2e7a5dd689005098487a6178d\r\n86e7323bdf8cb2c614ff6b63ca5909f484db8642\r\nAnd scheduler (distributed run queues), memory allocator (MCache) and parallel GC (Workbuf, parfor) were designed around the idea of not creating heavy write sharing in the first place.\r\nIf new instances of frequently written to variables were added since then, we need to get rid of them as well.",
