	"body": "@jucie, I am really puzzled here. Everything looks fine to me. You would have to try and understand why it is failing on your system (because you can easily reproduce this failure). I would try and add fmt.Printf calls in evalSymlinks in symlink_windows.go. I suspect toLong function does not convert C:\\\\USERS\\\\JUCIE\\\\APPDATA\\\\LOCAL\\\\TEMP\\\\EVALSYMLINKCANONICAL102278141\\\\TEST into C:\\\\Users\\\\jucie\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\evalsymlinkcanonical102278141\\\\test (and similar for other tests).\r\n\r\nIf you comment out defer os.RemoveAll(tmp) in TestEvalSymlinksCanonicalNames, you should be able to see real files / directories left over after the test. What is real directory name: C:\\\\USERS\\\\JUCIE\\\\APPDATA\\\\LOCAL\\\\TEMP\\\\EVALSYMLINKCANONICAL102278141\\\\TEST or C:\\\\Users\\\\jucie\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\evalsymlinkcanonical102278141\\\\test ?\r\n\r\nWhat is your file system type on the disk C: ? Is it NTFS?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAlex",
