Enabling 100-continue independent\nof redirects could be a useful optimization for some callers but is probably a separate\nfeature request.\n\nAn optimization where the body is an io.ReadSeeker is also possible, but leads to cases\nthat can only be tested based on runtime type and server responses, which seems  fragile.\u003c/pre\u003e",
