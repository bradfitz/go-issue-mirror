Add a GO386=sse2 vs GO386=387 setting, similar to GOARM, set by cmd/dist and\ndefaulting to sse2 when possible.\n\n2. Adapt CL 6549052 to use the new code or the old code based on GO386.\n\nI don't expect to have time for this for a few months.\nTo anyone is interested in doing it before then: it's all yours.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **---**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
