I just don't know how to implement it in such way that it is safe and\neasy to use.\n\nsyscall.FreeCallback is too complicated. In fact, you don't need syscall.FreeCallback,\njust remove code that keeps all windows callbacks in a list, and garbage collector will\npick them up.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
