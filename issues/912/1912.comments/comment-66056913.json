What happens if someone calls\nsyscall.NewCallback(myGoProc) in the loop, then we'll run out of memory for no reason. I\npropose, I'll increase limit from 20 to 2000 for now, this is a minimal effort on\neveryone's part. If we see runtime cost of keeping track duplicates increase\ndramatically, we could change linked list into something fancier, or we could follow\nyour suggestion and not track duplicates altogether then.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
