	"body": "The rules introduced in Go 1.6 for html/template template redefinition are just fundamentally broken. It allows too much redefinition. A simpler rule - the one I'm going to send out - is that you can't call Parse or AddParseTree or redefine anything after the first execution of any template in the set. The idea is that on first execute, the template set as a whole gets analyzed, after which point it must be considered frozen.\n\nWe'll see if there's pushback, but that's at least correct.",
