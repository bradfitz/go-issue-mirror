	"body": "In html/template, if you parse a new template (e.g. t2) after an associated template (e.g. t1) has been executed, Parse returns the mysterious error `html/template: cannot redefine \"t1\" after it has executed`. This is mysterious, because t1 is likely neither the template you were trying to define nor the one you were directly associating with. See https://play.golang.org/p/khYvpOgq-6\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen with text/template, and the docs don't make it sound like executing a template prevents adding new associated templates. The error message was added to html/template with the new `block` keyword in commit 12dfc3bee482f16263ce4673a0cce399127e2a0d.\r\n\r\nI believe the behavior is incorrect. But if not, I suggest changing the error message to `html/template: cannot (re)define any associated template after \"t1\" has executed`.",
