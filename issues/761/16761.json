	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n 1.7\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\ndarwin/amd_64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nTried to view  the docs for https://golang.org/pkg/log/syslog/#Dial\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nDocumentation/examples describing what the 'network' and 'raddr' values should be.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nNo mention of what those should be. It appears 'network' refers to 'address family' or 'protocol' (tcp/udp/unix/unixgram), rather than some string representing a network address. 'raddr' seems to be the 'host:port', or file path string for connecting to the socket.  I had to browse the test suite's source code to figure out what these should be. ",
