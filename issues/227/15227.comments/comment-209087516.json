	"body": "While Solaris generally guarantees binary compatibility, it doesn't guarantee source compatibility (obviously, that's not generally true for POSIX interfaces).\r\n\r\nThis means that header file definitions can change incompatibly between versions, which is going to start creating problems in the future as Solaris starts to change significantly, since the generated definitions that Go has checked into the gate don't actually match what version of Solaris that Go might be built on.\r\n\r\nI've largely been ignoring this problem for the moment since it only tends to affect very specific areas of the system, but a better answer is needed.  This seems like it might fit to a certain degree with what is mentioned here.\r\n\r\nTo add to this, historical OpenSolaris-based derivatives (e.g. SmartOS) are about five years behind Oracle Solaris in terms of ABI, so the ability to expose those will be necessary even if they are not supported by older derivatives.  Supporting only the most current production release of Solaris might be one choice, but the actual support lifetimes for a given Solaris release are measured in decades, so that might reduce Go's usefulness significantly on those platforms.",
