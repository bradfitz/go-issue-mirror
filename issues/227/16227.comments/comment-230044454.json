The warning in go/internal/gcimporter is a different case: an assignment where the RHS is an indirection of a function call.\r\n\r\nI see. I've been in the compiler too long--in my brain, that was getting inlined. If this is common enough, we could have vet do a bit of (semantic) inlining. But that's definitely way out of scope for 1.7.\r\n",
