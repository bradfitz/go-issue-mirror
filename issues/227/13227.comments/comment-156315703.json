	"body": "The crash is because munmap is failing.  When munmap fails, the code in sys_linux_amd64.s crashes the program.  This is simple but not especially helpful, especially since the errno value is lost.\r\n\r\nJust from looking at the code I think it's suspicious that the call to sysFree in gcCopySpans uses len(work.spans).  I think it needs to use cap(work.spans).  I could imagine that that could cause this problem in certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nCC @aclements @RLH ",
