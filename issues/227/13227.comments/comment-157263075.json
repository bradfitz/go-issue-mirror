	"body": "I believe this is a duplicate of #12233. Looking at the Linux kernel source, the primary failure mode of munmap is EINVAL for invalid arguments, but these arguments look fine. A secondary failure mode, however, is ENOMEM when too many VMA segments would be created, and that's exactly the problem #12233 was running into that @aclements fixed. That fix will be in Go 1.5.2.\r\n\r\nIf you're feeling adventurous, you can 'git fetch \u0026\u0026 git checkout release-branch.go1.5' and make.bash to get Go 1.5.1 + some of the patches we've queued for 1.5.2, including the VMA fragmentation fix.",
