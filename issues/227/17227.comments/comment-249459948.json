I think there is an ancient bug for that, or maybe we closed as it as WontFix.\r\n\r\nWe also explicitly do not support Hijack server-side for HTTP/2. Giving out the raw conn doesn't make sense, and giving \"the stream\" (as in: the HTTP/2) stream back as the `net.Conn` is kinda useless if the http.Handler can do the same already with Reading from Request.Body and writing to ResponseWriter.\r\n\r\n",
