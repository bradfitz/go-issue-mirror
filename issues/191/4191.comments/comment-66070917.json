That needs to\nbe fixed regardless.\n\nEven if you find it to be \"your fault\", please help me repro this.  If it's your timeout\ncode + closing before timeout, please replicate that combination in a nice little\nbradsucks.go file and I'll fix the panic at least, even if the code isn't what one\nshould do.\u003c/pre\u003e",
