Same program, but \n\n\ngoroutine 501870 [running]:\nnet/http.(*bodyEOFSignal).Read(0xf8406d45a0, 0xf8406df000, 0x8000, 0x8000, 0x5a8\n, ...)\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/net/http/transport.go:827 +0xcc\nio.(*multiReader).Read(0xf840118380, 0xf8406df000, 0x8000, 0x8000, 0x5a8, ...)\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/io/multi.go:13 +0x92\nio.Copy(0xf840145480, 0xf840573d60, 0xf8401450f0, 0xf840118380, 0xe92878, ...)\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/io/io.go:360 +0x1a9\nnet/http.(*transferWriter).WriteBody(0xf8402dc9a0, 0xf8400cac00, 0xf8405c7c80, 0\nx0, 0x0, ...)\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/net/http/transfer.go:194 +0x1c6\nnet/http.(*Request).write(0xf8405d9820, 0xf8400cac00, 0xf8405c7c80, 0x0, 0xf8401\n18680, ...)\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/net/http/request.go:371 +0x833\nnet/http.(*persistConn).writeLoop(0xf840162f00, 0x0)\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/net/http/transport.go:661 +0x1b8\ncreated by net/http.(*Transport).getConn\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/net/http/transport.go:409 +0x5cd\n\n\nThe problem does go away if I disable my timeout, but I've still not reproduced it\noutside of this thing without crashing a machine.  Part of that is likely in trying to\nmake it happen too fast.\n\n...which is odd, because the timeout is straightforward.  Socket has a deadline on read.\n I am most likely not reading from the body soon enough (due to processing of stuff\ncoming off of it) and when I go back to read from it, it breaks.  This happened after\nabout 800,000 articles and who knows how many images I pulled from them today.  It was\nseveral hours.\u003c/pre\u003e",
