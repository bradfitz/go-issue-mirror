I thought it\ncould be because of the socket timeouts (though I have no evidence that this is\noccurring), but if I write a test that does tons of HTTP requests in tight loops that\nare all timing out, it seems to do the right thing.\n\nI thought it might be something related to fetching the data from wikipedia itself, but\nI ran a test doing just that for hours yesterday and never saw as much as the\nunsolicited response warning (which I get occasionally even without a corresponding\ncrash).\n\nIn the meantime, I've disabled the timeout handling on my client that's got it. \nSometimes my process crashes within fifteen minutes, and sometimes it runs for three or\nfour hours.  It'll be a while before I have confidence that that makes a difference.\n\nHowever, if it does, the way I was using it was very specific.  I had a type that holds\nthe underlying connection to an http server and sets the read timeout forward on every\nread.  As far as I can tell, that had a pretty constant stream of data on that one\nconnection, and it's code I've been running continuously for months.\n\nThe rest of the connections are using an unmodified default client as seen in the gist. \nI can't tell what the clients that are leading to the panic were connected to.\u003c/pre\u003e",
