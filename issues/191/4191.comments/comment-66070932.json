It means a client doing a blocking read can hang\nforever, since it's holding the mutex, preventing a Close from closing the underlying\nReadCloser.\n\nI think I changed too much in this CL.  It's quite likely that just some of the bug\nfixes were enough, without redoing the bodyEOFSignal's locking logic.\n\nSo I'll probably ask you to test a future version of the patch.\u003c/pre\u003e",
