Hard to say authoritatively that the problem is gone, but\nconfidence continues to rise as the program continues to not crash.  :)\n\nAlso, my test program isn't crashing after running for a while.\n\nIt's probably right, but my program should finish in the next day or two and that will\nbe the highest vote of confidence.\u003c/pre\u003e",
