	"body": "There is code in src/syscall/syscall_linux_arm64.go file:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc Getpagesize() int { return 65536 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this architecture supports three values for PAGE_SIZE: 4K, 16K and 64K which are selected at kernel compilation time.\r\n\r\nUserspace is expected to check which value is set. Simplest solution is to use sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) function call (same as getpagesize()).",
