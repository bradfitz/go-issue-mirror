	"body": "I had some code like this:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n*buf.RGBA() = *img\r\ntx.Upload(image.ZP, buf, buf.Bounds())\r\nwin.Copy(min, tx, tx.Bounds(), screen.Src, nil)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis worked on gldriver, but not x11driver. After switching to the following, it worked on both:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ndraw.Draw(buf.RGBA(), img.Bounds(), img, image.ZP, draw.Src)\r\ntx.Upload(image.ZP, buf, buf.Bounds())\r\nwin.Copy(min, tx, tx.Bounds(), screen.Src, nil)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have not yet investigated why it works on one but not the other, but first: should this work? It feels like I'm paying a performance penalty by drawing my image to buf.RGBA() when I already have exactly the image that I want.",
