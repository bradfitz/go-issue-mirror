Instead, it should be able to render itself onto a Buffer's *image.RGBA (where the Buffer is provided by Screen.NewBuffer).\r\n\r\nAh, thank you. This is obvious now that you say it (I missed it last time, apparently). I've been stuck on the idea that I need to construct my own image, and then copy it to the buffer.\r\n\r\n\u003e you might not need to explicitly use a Texture. A Window already has an Upload method, which takes a Buffer.\r\n\r\nYes, my example code was simplified. Usually I can reuse the texture (which I believe is hypothetically cheaper than uploading the buffer each time).",
