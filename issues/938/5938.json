	"body": "by **jake.austwick**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nRunning the following gist produces the problem. I tried to make a smaller test case,\nbut it doesn't seem to leak when just parsing local files. It seems that html.Parse() is\nnot getting all the memory used garbage collected.\n\nMemory will only leak using live URL's like the file below.\n\nSample Program:\n\u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/JakeAustwick/1cbdb5e9e3e778b4ff42\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/JakeAustwick/1cbdb5e9e3e778b4ff42\u003c/a\u003e\n\nurls.txt (needed to run):\n\u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/JakeAustwick/82c9d4ce300639a4d275/raw/368c41ce6ba95f03cbc25a188dd3c07646a068b0/gistfile1.txt\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/JakeAustwick/82c9d4ce300639a4d275/raw/368c41ce6ba95f03cbc25a188dd3c07646a068b0/gistfile1.txt\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nMemory not to increase until system memory is exhausted.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nMemory slowly increases until it is all gone. Increase WORKER_COUNT to increase leakage\nspeed.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nUbuntu 12.10\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version'):\n\ngo version go1.1 linux/amd64\u003c/pre\u003e",
