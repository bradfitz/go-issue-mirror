	"body": "by **aaron@hubernet.net**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1.  Use the websocket client to initiate a connection where an HTTP proxy is required.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nSuccessful HTTP CONNECT is issued via the proxy server to the endpoint.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nConnection is attempted directly and fails.\n\nCurrent websocket code does not contain any logic to connect via an HTTP proxy server\nwhich is supported by the WebSockets protocol.\u003c/pre\u003e",
