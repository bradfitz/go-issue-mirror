What did you do?\r\n\r\nvendor a package into another. run 'go tool vet -v thepkg/thefile.go'\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nAny vet reports.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nMissing reports when compared to having the vendored lib in the gopath like normal. Also see in the output, something like:\r\n\r\nvet: ./internal/httpserver/httpserver.go:13:2: could not import github.com/rs/cors (can't find import: COMPANYSPECIFIC/vendor/github.com/rs/cors)\r\n\r\nwhich is not the case if the dependency is in the gopath.\r\n\r\nAnother user with the same thing on the mailing list and me whining in the thread :)\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/golang-nuts/vet$20vendor/golang-nuts/uTcfZ15Ks0U/XBOXyfVPAQAJ\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",
