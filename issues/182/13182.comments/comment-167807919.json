	"body": "With the exception of file name, you can shorten to:\r\n - SetFlags(0), SetPrefix(\"\")\r\n - call SetOutput(w)\r\n - w.Write gets just the log message and can add whatever prefix or formatting it wants, without any parsing\r\n\r\nIf you want file names, then yes you have to use SetFlags(Llongfile) or Lshortfile and parse the file name. That's unfortunate, but it doesn't seem worth a whole new API. If we were starting over then yes I think we might reasonably make SetOutput take a func and have a separate SetWriter. But we're not starting over. We're working with what we have. If we created new API every time we realized we could have done something differently, we'd end up with a much larger (and arguably bloated) standard library. The bar is very high for additions.",
