That's one of the three conditions listed at https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/PortingPolicy#first-class-ports\r\n\r\nWe now distribute binaries for s390x, even though the majority of Go contributors are unable to contribute fixes to it.\r\n\r\nWe also ship binaries for FreeBSD, despite instability, and we didn't stop the Go 1.7 release for it. If we had runtime crashing bugs for Linux (or even Windows), we certainly would've debugged more before shipping. That shows that FreeBSD is not a first class port.\r\n",
