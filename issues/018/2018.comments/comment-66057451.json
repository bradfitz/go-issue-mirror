The programs in test/bugs are supposed to be erroneous.\n\nTake a look at the bug322.dir/main.go code and at the bottom it points out that those\nerrors are no longer supposed to happen.\n\nAre you saying that's the \"1 known bugs\" that it's reporting?\n\nThe problem i have is that my build fails because of this. If that's the known bug, it\nshouldn't fail my build, right?\u003c/pre\u003e",
