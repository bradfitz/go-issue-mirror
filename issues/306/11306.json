	"body": "https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/8\r\n\r\nNewton's method for Sqrt is shown as\r\n\r\n![z = z - (x**2-x)/2x](https://tour.golang.org/content/img/newton.png)\r\n\r\nwhich is weird. Math does not use the same z for noting two different values, that only happens for us imperative programmers. Perhaps it should say something like\r\n\r\n- `z_1 = z_0 ...`, with subscripts\r\n- `z_(n+1) = z_n ...`\r\n- `z' = z ...`",
