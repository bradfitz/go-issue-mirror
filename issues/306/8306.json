When running such a program a large multiple number of times,\nthere is a big chance to reach the number of files opened imposed by the system (ulimit\n-n). The evidence of such a creation can be accessed in /proc/${PID_OF_PROGRAM}/fd where\nthe number of file descriptors increase without stopping.\n\nReproducing all steps without calling session.Run(command) does not show this behaviour.\n\nSince the documentation to use the ssh package is not very clear, I'm maybe missing\nsomething...\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\n** A non increasing number of opened files when running multiple command with multiple\nsessions.\n\n** See the attached file for a test case (should work as it with go test...or not)\n\nThank you for any suggestion!\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/8306/0/mysession_test.go\"\u003emysession_test.go\u003c/a\u003e (2591 bytes)",
