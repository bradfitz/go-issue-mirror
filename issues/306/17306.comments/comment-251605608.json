It should be enough.\r\n\r\nThe problem with straightforward enabling of Pool under race detector is that it will introduce lots of parasitic synchronization (esp the Mutex) that can hide lots of unrelated races.\r\n\r\nWe could annotate Pool to synchronize on the objects cached (i.e. if goroutine A takes object X put by goroutine B, then A synchronizes only with B). But values are not necessary pointers.\r\nWe could also enable cache probablistically -- randomly decide to Put or to drop.",
