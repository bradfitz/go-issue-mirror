	"body": "[moved from discussion in CL 21981]\r\n\r\nCSE can remove many values, so it'd be good to do a deadcode pass promptly after it, to speed up other passes. We used to, but it has slowly drifted away. However, deadcode allocates some potentially large slices: two work lists (small) and two bool slices (larger). We should make at least those bool slices reusable in f.Config and then add a deadcode after CSE.\r\n\r\ncc @tzneal \r\n\r\nBtw, @bradfitz, do you think it's worth having a label for compiler performance/speed (as opposed to compiled code performance)?\r\n",
