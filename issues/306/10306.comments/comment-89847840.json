I didn't realize there was an open issue and a different fix until I saw the conflicting change listed in Gerrit.\r\n\r\nOn a project I work on, errcheck fails with this error the majority of the time using the master revision of go/loader. It does not fail with this error using the branch from CL 8421 or CL 8475 (although with CL 8421, it should still be possible to have this error occur in conf.FindPackage).",
