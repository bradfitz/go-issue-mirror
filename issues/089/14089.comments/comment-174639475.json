For that you need to use https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#ReadMemStats .\r\n\r\nOver time the Go runtime will return unused memory to the system, and that will (I believe) be visible on the activity monitor.  This process takes 5 minutes or more; the Go runtime is conservative, since the program might need the memory again soon.",
