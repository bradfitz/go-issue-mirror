	"body": "@ianlancetaylor @post-l , I just change to the code to below, the issue I observed is not out-of-memory, it is the memory not reclaimed after each goroutine finishes. As the below code shows, for each goroutine, after running ReadFile, the memory should be reclaimed. But we wait at time.Sleep,\r\nI observe in the \"Activity Monitor\", the process remains using a few GBs of memory.......\r\n```\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tfor i := 1; i \u003c= 100000; i++ {\r\n\t\tgo func() {\r\n\t\t\tdata, err := ioutil.ReadFile(\"xxx.pdf\") // choose some relatively large file\r\n\t\t\tif err == nil \u0026\u0026 len(data) \u003e 0 {\r\n\t\t\t\treturn\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}()\r\n\t}\r\n\ttime.Sleep(time.Second * 100)\r\n}\r\n```",
