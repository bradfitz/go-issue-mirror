We could work to change tests to invoke the right \"go\", but the assumption\nis going to creep back in, because nearly everyone working on Go already does put their\ndevelopment bin directory ahead of the system bins. It's fine to change existing tests\nif you'd like not to do this for some reason, but you'll probably have to keep fixing\nthem as new ones crop up.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-none**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
