You input: \"Col1\\t \\tCol3\\tCol4\" with\nTrimLeadingSpace set to false produces 4 fields, the second one being \" \", but with\nTrimLeadingSpace set to true the the input for the second field is \" \\tCol3\\tCol4\".  The\n\" \\t\" should be removed as they are both space characters so the second field is \"Col3\"\nand only 3 fields are produced.\n\nWhat should the following input be if TrimLeadingSpace is true and Comma is a space?  (.\n== space)  \"a.b..c...d\"?\n\nUsing a white space character as a comma and setting TrimLeadingSpace is not well\ndefined.  It would be better for you to call strings.TrimLeft(field, unicode.IsSpace) on\nyour fields after having CSV parse them without trimming the leading space.\u003c/pre\u003e",
