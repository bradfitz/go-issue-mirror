In some country\nother characters are more or less standard (; in Sweden). In LibreOffice there 5\nstandard choices for delimiters when saving to CSV, two of them white space characters:\n, ; : {tab} {space}\n\nIn these cases, non-enclosed delimiters are always considered delimiters, never a white\nspace.\n\nYour example a.b..c...d should of course result in:\na b {empty} c {empty} {empty} d\n\n\n\n\n* Reffering to: \u003ca href=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt\"\u003ehttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
