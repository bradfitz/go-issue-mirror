Wouldn't monitoring the latency of an application request be a more direct and ultimately more correct way to do this. If latency increases shed load. If latency improves increase load. \r\n\r\nIs there a use case where this doesn't work but NumActiveGoroutines does?\r\n\r\nDiscussing the nuances of what _Gidle, _Grunnable, _Grunning, _Gsyscall, _Gwaiting plus what _Gscanrunning _Gscanrunnable, _Gscansyscall, and _Gscanidle means in this context is a very implementation dependent discussion.",
