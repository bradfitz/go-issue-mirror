Note that because of this gopprof does not work out of\nthe box on a Mac.\n\nsub ConfigureTool in misc/pprof says that you can use it's --tools parameter or the\nPPROF_TOOLS environment variable to specify which tools (like nm) are used. I however\nfound it easiest to add the folder containing go's nm to my path by adding the following\nto my ~/.bashrc file:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/darwin_amd64:$PATH\"\u003c/pre\u003e",
