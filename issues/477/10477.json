	"body": "We set -p 1 by default for darwin/arm, because it's impossible to run more than one test at a time on the iOS device (each test is packaged as an app for execution).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/go/build.go#L137\r\n\r\nAs a result, stdlib builds also happen one package at a time on the host, which can be a bit frustrating when you're looking for a compiler error.\r\n\r\nJust for this I don't think it's worth complicating the go command to separate the notions of parallelism, but if some other changes happen to its work scheduling, parallel darwin/arm builds would be nice to have.",
