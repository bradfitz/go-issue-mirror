	"body": "by **qeed.quan**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eHi, this is a request for a floating point color struct defined inside image/color,\nsomething like\n \ntype FRGBA32 struct {\nR, G, B, A float32 \n}\n\nand \n\ntype FRGBA64 struct {\nR, G, B, A float64\n}\n\nthis is for opengl/directx color formats, since the shaders default to using the\nfloating point to represent the colors, it will be nice to have a type already in the\npackage to use rather than defining your own.\u003c/pre\u003e",
