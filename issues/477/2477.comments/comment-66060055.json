If lots of different\npackages wanted to use the same floating-point color type to interoperate, then that's a\nstronger argument, but I don't see many such packages at the moment.\n\nThe analogy isn't perfect, but freetype-go defines its own geometry types in its own\npackages, not in the standard package library, and I think that that works perfectly\nwell.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
