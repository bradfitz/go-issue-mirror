	"body": "It actually is a problem with the garbage collection itself. The examples thus far call `runtime.GC()` to more easily demonstrate and expose the issue. In production I have a number of large maps and using the default implementation we have observed garbage collection pauses measuring hundreds of milliseconds. It was bad enough that we dug in to pinpoint exactly what was causing it.\r\n\r\nThe biggest question being raised in this issue is whether optimizations could be made on certain kinds of structures such as maps where the contained type is known to not contain pointers, such as a `map[int]bool`, etc.",
