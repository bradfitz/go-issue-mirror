	"body": "Right @randall77, there's no limit on the number of overflow buckets. If a map stays about the same size but has a lot of churn, it seems like each of the primary buckets could grow to have a considerable number of overflow buckets chained to them - the random distribution of elements could bump each bucket over 8 or 16 elements, without ever increasing the average beyond the load factor. Since the overflow buckets aren't freed when they're emptied via runtimeÂ·mapdelete, the expansion would be permanent.\r\n\r\nThere'd probably need to be an \"overflow bucket evacuation\" process that would operate like the current evacuation to allow resizing of the new array. Added complexity for sure, but it may be worth it.\r\n\r\nDo you happen to have statistics on how many overflow buckets end up used for long-lived maps with churn? This could maybe be collected at runtime by chasing the overflow map pointers, or offline by inspecting debug.WriteHeapDump output?",
