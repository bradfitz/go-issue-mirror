	"body": "We would not have this kind of problem if go provided an \"unmanaged\" library which could implement manual memory management for regions of heap to be ignored by the GC. Neither a pointer to any address to the \"unmanaged\" heap nor any pointer type stored inside the \"unmanaged\" heap would be considered for GC. This could be a very simple solution which would solve once and for all the problems that go has with long-lived pointer values and which will probably never be solved by GC.",
