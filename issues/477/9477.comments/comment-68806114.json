For maps which have had an iterator started on them, however, I don't see any easy way to compact.  Your idea of repurposing evacuation to do compacting may work.  We'd then have two types of evacuation - to a map of the same size and a map of double the size.  Both would be triggered by running out of the overflow bucket pool.  We'd have to figure out which to do at that point (how?).\r\n\r\n",
