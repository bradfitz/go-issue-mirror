Of course I'm still looking forward to future map improvements :)\r\n\r\nWith @dvyukov's change, GC pause behavior for maps should more closely resemble that for the other aggregate data types and should be easier to reason about in general (say, if you're trying to reduce pause latency and you know the \"duration is proportional to # of pointers on the heap\" rule of thumb).",
