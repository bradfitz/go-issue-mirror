	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\nThis issue is observed by reading the source code of the master branch.\r\n\r\nWhile reading the code the other day I noticed that the `p` structure in `src/runtime/runtime2.go` includes the following at line 501:\r\n```\r\npad [64]byte\r\n```\r\n\r\nI assume the intention is to pad by `sys.CacheLineSize` to avoid false sharing between the `p` structures. The value of 64 is currently plausible, but only because `ppc64x` is incorrectly configured with a cache line size of 64. (It should be 128; Someone from IBM will propose/confirm a fix - @laboger ?)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
