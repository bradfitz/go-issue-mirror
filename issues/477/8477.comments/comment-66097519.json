This makes me a\nlittle surprised if the integrated network poller is currently working correctly on\nlinux/amd64, but I haven't looked into it further yet.\n\nThe Sigcontext struct change is because Linux has moved fpstate into an anonymous union.\n The Go runtime doesn't touch fpstate anyway, so that seems harmless.\u003c/pre\u003e",
