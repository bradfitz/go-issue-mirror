If merged, it would allow to tweak the XML outputs of the property system further without breaking the current package tests.\r\n\r\n@mpl I had a look at your CL and will comment soon. I played a bit with the latest xml package namespace feature and am somewhat puzzled that it doesn't suffice to declare the D prefix for the DAV: namespace at the start of the multistatus tag. I'll do some further testing but am inclined to reach out to Roger Peppe if he could spare a minute to comment.\r\n\r\n[1] https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/11032/",
