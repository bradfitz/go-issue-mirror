So it just stops after the second PROPFIND attempt, whereas in version 6.3.9600 it continues to PROPFIND / with Depth 1.\r\n\r\nI wonder: Do we have to declare namespace prefixes on *all* elements?\r\n\r\nCase in point: Since MiniRedir version 6.1.7601 works with your CL it is clear that it does not expect a namespace prefix on *all* elements. The following, hardcoded payload was not amended in your CL (it's defined here https://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/webdav/prop.go#L380).\r\n\r\n    \u003clockentry xmlns=\"DAV:\"\u003e\r\n       \u003clockscope\u003e\u003cexclusive/\u003e\u003c/lockscope\u003e\r\n       \u003clocktype\u003e\u003cwrite/\u003e\u003c/locktype\u003e\r\n    \u003c/lockentry\u003e\r\n\r\nand yet, MiniRedir seems just to be fine with it. Maybe it only expects a namespace prefix on the multistatus root element? Or the propstat or href? Would it be possible for you to test this? (I don't have Windows 7 at hand.)\r\n\r\nI agree that to make this work with Windows 7, fixing the namespace prefixes is the way to go forward. I just want to minimise the impact this has on the XML marshalling and testing internals; that's wobbly enough without picky clients like MiniRedir, already.",
