And yes, third time the charm: it did compile after two unsuccessful compilations without -a.\r\n\r\nI tried to follow the linker's code around this error message, and I'm confused: I never wanted CGO, and in this particular place `iscgo` is false, yet for some reason it is followed by `loadinternal(\"runtime/cgo\")`.\r\n\r\nSince I'm interested in any sort of solution to this: is there any way to completely avoid having to deal with CGO, or are some bits of it mandatory?  If it is possible, then what do I need to do to exclude it?",
