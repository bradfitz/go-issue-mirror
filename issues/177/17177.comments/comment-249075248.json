	"body": "Ah so what's going on is that when the linker looks for the runtime package, it finds $WORK/runtime.a but there is no $WORK/runtime.shlibname file to indicate that it is part of a shared library as the shlibname files are only created as part of installation. When the shared library is linked as a separate step, the runtime.a is next to a runtime.shlibname, so the link loads libstd.so, including the runtime/cgo package and so the later search for runtime/cgo finds that it has already been loaded.\r\n\r\nI guess a fix would be to have the shlibname files created after the library is built and just copy them for the install step. @ianlancetaylor does that make sense to you?",
