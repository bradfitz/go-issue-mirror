In other words, the user can work around this problem. That's in contrast to the current situation, where `p2.a` isn't linked into `p1.a`, and the user can't predict the location of `p2.a` to work around the situation manually.\r\n\r\nHaving cgo not worry about undefined symbols won't work because that's not a concept that exists in Portable Executables (windows).",
