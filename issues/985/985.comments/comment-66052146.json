Googling around a bit suggest that many dispute the validity of having\nboth query parameters and POST body. If that argument was valid, it would hint more at\ncomplaining or ignoring the second set of arguments.\n\nThe only reason given for having a single mapping populated from both sets is that it\nmakes sharing GET/POST with the same handler is easier. I have personally had only one\ninstance where such a fallback made sense. That was the auto-magic login page for a\nDjango application. If you are not logged in, you would get a redirect to\n/login?next=/you/tried/this... and the form included the URL, so it would have to use\nthe query parameter for the GET case and the (POST) form data when executing the login.\nLooking back, I would now just pass the original URL including all parameters as action\ninto the login form. That would remove the last useful case I have for automatically\nselecting one set or the other.\u003c/pre\u003e",
