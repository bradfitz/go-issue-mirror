That's a valid example value you might get for server requests.\r\n\r\nNow i see that i didn't read the comment properly, since client is supposed to automatically handle the incoming requests based on their proto. One of the reasons why one would ignore `.Proto` field on client side. \r\n\r\nThat was my confusion, thanks for clarifying.  \r\n\r\nBut is it ever valid to set `.Proto` after `http.NewRequest` to some value but the underlying write() is always defaulting to HTTP/1.1 - just wondering if this behavior is correct?
