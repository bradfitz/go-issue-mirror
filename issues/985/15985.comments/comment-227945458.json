	"body": "Thank you for your proposal. A few random thoughts.\r\n- Perhaps `datalink` might be a better package name\r\n - I'm not keen on providing Ethernet marshaler/unmarshaler\r\n- It's okay that this package focuses on a bit slow BPF/LSF and AF_PACKET socket IO\r\n - Having a separate package that implements Netmap/DPDK-like faster stuff sounds reasonable\r\n- s/Conn/PacketConn/\r\n- It's fine to have an internal kqueue/epoll code fragments\r\n- Probably we need a type that can be used to configure BPF/LSF files and AF_PACKET sockets; maybe 'type Listener struct { }`?\r\n\r\nA simple question: What's the reason why we need to provide RawConn on Linux?\r\n",
