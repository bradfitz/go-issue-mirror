My intended project is a \"universal auto-join\" tool which is used in security testing settings to join any network, regardless of configuration (presence of DHCP, MAC filtering, etc). I need to have direct access to raw frames for this project to do things like packet sniffing, ARP spoofing, manually speaking DHCP, etc.",
