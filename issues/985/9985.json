	"body": "There are some useful defaults we could have for app icons. Place an icon in \u003cpkg\u003e/assets/icon.png, and it gets used.\r\n\r\nBut it turns out there are many icons. Android has an arbitrary number of potential sizes, depending on the DPI of the screen. iOS has a series of fixed sizes. Both also have much larger store icons (1024x1024 and 512x512).\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html\r\n\r\nGiven the large number of android combinations, automatic scaling might make sense. However users may need the ability to provide multiple icons, as small images often require artistic adjustment to the number of pixels. One possibility is \u003cpkg\u003e/assets/iconUxV.png.",
