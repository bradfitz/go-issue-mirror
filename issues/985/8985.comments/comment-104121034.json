There still are various address family transition stuff: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_transition_mechanism, and we need a type that can grab any IP address for supporting such transition features. Also we cannot provide such IsIPv4, IsIPv6 methods without application context. For example, what happens when an application treats IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses as IPv4 addresses.\r\n\r\nFWIW, this IETF v6ops thread, http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/v6ops/current/msg22039.html, might be interesting for some people.",
