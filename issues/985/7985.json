	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThere is CSmith (\u003ca href=\"http://embed.cs.utah.edu/csmith/)\"\u003ehttp://embed.cs.utah.edu/csmith/)\u003c/a\u003e that generates random correct C\nprograms, and it's proved to be extremely useful in testing C compilers.\n\nWe could do something similar for Go.\nThe tool can use existing ast/types/ssa packages for program generation and\nserialization. The tool can start very small, e.g generate only simple assignment\nstatement. And then gradually grow.\n\nThe tool could be used for testing of a range of programs and packages besides gc/gccgo\ncompilation:\n- gofmt idempotentness (gofmt several times and compare results)\n- ast/types/ssa robustness and idempotentness (generate, serialize, parse, serialize,\nparse, compare).\n- govet robustness\n- compilation in race mode which had lots of bugs in past\n- compare gc, gccgo, ssa/interp output\n\nI foresee piles of bugs there.\u003c/pre\u003e",
