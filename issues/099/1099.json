The compiler was stepping on R9 and R10, and the CL patches that\nup by permanently reserving them in regalloc.  But the right fix is to reserve them\ncentrally and to clean up the register allocator code so it doesn't allocate registers\nacross function calls. Because it does this, tying up those two registers causes a\nnumber of expressions in the sources to be uncompilable.  This CL therefore also\ncontains some ugly simplifications.\n\nOnce the true fix is in, this CL should be reverted wholesale.\u003c/pre\u003e",
