Without something like that, we can't\ndistinguish who's being served at the server side, which restricts\npossibilities like redirecting people to an external documentation\nsite like Gary's gopkgdoc, for example, or even generating the page\nfor go get dynamically without interfering with the normal site\ncontent.\n\nSomething like having ?go-import=1 would already do it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
