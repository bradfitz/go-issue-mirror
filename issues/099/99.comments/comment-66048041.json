As you say yourself, \"experienced coders can read code faster if it follows \nthe coding style they're used to\" - it doesn't work if they can't use the coding \nstyle that they're used to in the first place.\nAt the end of the day, coding style is a matter of personal preference and it's just \nunrealistic to expect to make everyone on the planet to agree upon a certain style. \n\nIt's possible within the confine of a development team though, and that's where the \ndecision should be made.\u003c/pre\u003e",
