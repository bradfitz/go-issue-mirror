I am not asking you to make this default.\nI just want to have a choice (there already are few options - spaces vs. tabs etc.,\nso this is no break-in attempt).\nThat's what open source is all about - make default setup, call it a standard, but\nstill let people choose their own way. Please don't push your de facto standard by\nforce. That would be counterproductive.\u003c/pre\u003e",
