Once we start using new package we would have to use both old and new in the same source file most of the time. If we name both syscall, then one package would have to be renamed once imported. Why should we think about new name every time we import internal/syscall? Why not come up with good name now, name the package and use it from now on?\r\n\r\nAlex",
