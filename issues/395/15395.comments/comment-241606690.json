According to the syscall blocking profile in the multicore trace you attached to your original message, you're spending 50ms blocked in the unmount syscall (from github.com/docker/docker/daemon/graphdriver/aufs.Unmount). There are plenty of other syscalls in that trace that you don't spend appreciable time in, suggesting that the performance problem is in unmount (possibly AUFS unmount) itself.\r\n\r\nIt would be worth trying with Go 1.7, though if it is an issue in the kernel, that won't make a difference. As an experiment, you could also try invoking just that unmount syscall from, say, C, and time that. If it also takes a long time in C, then we know it's not a Go issue. Running this under \"perf record\" may also prove enlightening, though if the delay comes from blocking not much will show up.",
