And we should advise everyone to use high-level crypto APIs\nlike crypto/x509 or x/crypto/nacl  instead.\n\nNo, this reasoning is fundamentally wrong. It's not the programming\nlanguage's\njob to prevent bad use of libraries. Go is not a crypto toolkit, so it\nshould not\ndictate what people should use.\n\nIâ€˜m against removing of any of the existing packages in crypto/*, nor should\nwe warn about use of insecure primitives, because, believe it or not, they\nare still widely used.\n\nThe banking industry still uses 3DES a lot, probably due to extreme backward\ncompat requirements, and even Google Drive API only provides MD5 and\nCRC32 for files.\n\nAnd remember, system comprised only of secure crypto primitives is not\nnecessarily secure (and the sad reality is, most of these systems are indeed\nnot as secure as they should be.)\n\nIf you care about the security of Go programs, perhaps we should make\nour various crypto primitive implementations resilient against side channel\nattacks first.\n",
