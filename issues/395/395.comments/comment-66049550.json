At one\npoint conversion syntax and type guard syntax was \ninterchangeable.  It clarified things quite a bit\nto require that in x.(T), x must be an interface value\nand that in T(x), the conversion must be statically\nguaranteed to succeed.\n\nUnfortunately, this particular conversion doesn't fit \ninto either of those categories.\n\nWe've got enough going on that's it going to be a while\nbefore we do anything with this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
