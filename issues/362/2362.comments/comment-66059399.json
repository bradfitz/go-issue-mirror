The image/jpeg package doesn't promise to be a complete JPEG\nimplementation. For example, it doesn't support 12-bit JPEG images, or arithmetic-coded\nJPEG images.\n\nI note that \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling#4:2:1\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling#4:2:1\u003c/a\u003e currently says that\n'4:2:1' \"is not expressible in J:a:b notation. '4:2:1' is a hangover from a previous\nnotational scheme, and very few software or hardware codecs use it.\"\u003c/pre\u003e",
