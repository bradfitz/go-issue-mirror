As this is\na) common and b) sensible it does not seem worth changing.\n\nBut such images are legal jpegs (in my understanding of\nthe spec).\n\nIt should be able to decode such an 2x2,1x1,2x2 image\ninto 2x2,1x1,1x1 (4:2:0) YCbCr by subsampling Cr.  This \nwould keep the image dimensions but discard some chroma\ninformation contained in the image.\n\n(To keep the chroma information one _could_ return an\nimage.RGBA.)\n\nIs this a) worth fixing and b) would downsampling Cr\nbe the right fix?\u003c/pre\u003e",
