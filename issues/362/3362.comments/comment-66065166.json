This would allow the implementation to be simplified, standard\nlibrary side, by setting the ReadDeadline on the net.Conn before waiting on a Read (and\nwouldn't incur a goroutine spawn per request which is expensive at high volume).\n\nWas sitting in Peek() used to attempt detection of connections that are closed on you? \nIsn't that sorta racey?\u003c/pre\u003e",
