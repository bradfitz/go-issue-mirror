In an effort to be clear about some edge\ncases, e.g. redirection, what's most important in my applications is when using\n`keep-alive` and calling `response, err := httpClient.Get(...)` I can express a\nguarantee that the calling code will eventually have control returned to it. Meaning\nconnection creation, TLS handshaking, redirects, POST data to send (obviously not for a\n`Get`) and receiving the body from the server needs to be covered by a single, or some\ncombination of timeouts.\u003c/pre\u003e",
