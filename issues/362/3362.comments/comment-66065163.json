It's\npurely the time after writing the full request (including optional body), until we get\nresponse headers.\n\nI'm focusing first on the primitives you can't do otherwise.  Dial timeouts can already\nbe done with the Transport.Dial hook.\n\nTimeouts reading the response.Body can be done purely by Go code, especially once Issue\n3672 is fixed to just kill the TCP connection.\n\nThe one that remains then is timeouts writing the request Body, where we might want\nsomething like IdleTimeout.\n\nI'm also considering whether we might want:\n\nfunc (t *Transport) StopRequest(r *Request)\n\n... so people implementing timeouts in their own programs have a reliable mechanism to\nshut down a request's TCP connection, since the Transport knows which request went to\nwhich connection.\n\nIf we had that, maybe we wouldn't need the request Body timeout.\u003c/pre\u003e",
