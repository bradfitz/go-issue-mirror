HeaderTimeout and InactivityTimeout seem to be relatively uncommon, and\nwould require that a particular request has claimed a connection as its own out of a\npool until the corresponding timeout has passed or the request has completed. Its not\nunrealistic to expect applications that rely on this level of detail to implement their\nown RoundTripper, as connection pooling may not be as critical for APIs that have\ndisparate requirements around the timing of header responses and byte level responses.\n\nThe way I envisioned this was to simply have the timeout based on the total running time\nof a call to Tranport.RoundTrip, including any redirects. This is relatively\nstraightforward and should meet the needs of most applications.\u003c/pre\u003e",
