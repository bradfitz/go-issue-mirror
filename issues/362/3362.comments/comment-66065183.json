Using a custom dial method to invoke\n`DialWithTimeout` works for a connect timeout, but none of the TLS handshaking has\nhappened when that returns. Currently none of the timeouts address a TLS handshake\ntiming out.\n\nIf a connection is to be used for exactly one request, a deadline can be set, but with\nre-use of working connections, I don't think there's a way to update the deadline before\nevery HTTP request; unless I'm mistaken, the underlying `net.Conn` structures are never\nexposed outside of the http package other than through the custom Dial function.\u003c/pre\u003e",
