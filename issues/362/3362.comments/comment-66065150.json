We may even want all three:\n\n// HeaderTimeout is the amount of time to wait to get a response header\n// after writing the request.  It does not include the response body.\n// Zero means no timeout.\nHeaderTimeout time.Duration\n\n// ResponseTimeout is like HeaderTimeout, but includes the time to transmit\n// the entire body, regardless of size.  If the server is still sending\n// the body as ResponseTimeout is hit, the body is interrupted and a Read\n// will result in ErrTimeout. \nResponseTimeout time.Duration\n\n// InactivityTimeout is the amount of time to get any data from the server\n// before considering it timed out. Unlike HeaderTimeout and ResponseTimeout,\n// this timer resets every time a byte of data is received from the server,\n// so a slow trickle of data could take a large amount of time. \n// Zero means no timeout.\nInactivityTimeout time.Duration\u003c/pre\u003e",
