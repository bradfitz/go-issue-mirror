	"body": "Use case is to identify both input interface and remote UDP endpoint (IP-addr,port) for received datagram directed at a local multicast address.\r\n\r\nPacketConn.ReadFrom() can provide ControlMessage containing the ifIndex for the input interface.\r\n\r\nUDPConn.ReadFromUDP() returns net.UDPAddr with the source socket address (srcIP+srcPort) of the datagram.\r\n\r\nHowever, how to get BOTH informations: input interface ifIndex **AND** remote socket address (srcIPAddr+srcPort) ?\r\n\r\nIn C, I can read those informations with recvmsg() plus IP_PKTINFO. But it seems such an API is missing from Go.",
