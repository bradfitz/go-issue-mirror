Relying on it to be random is just as\nbad as relying on it to be sorted, or repeatable, or whatever.  Making it random is an\nattempt to *prevent* people from relying on the order, not an *invitation* to rely on\nthe order for randomness.\n\nAs you have noticed, the randomness could be improved, but I don't think it's a high\npriority.  The randomness costs something, so we use as little of it as possible, just\nenough to make the order not consistent (to prevent people from relying on consistent\nordering).  The fact that \u0026lt;=8 size maps return a consistent order bothers me a tiny\nbit, but I'm not going to lose sleep over it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
