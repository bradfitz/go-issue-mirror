It is an inconvenience\nfor me since my map contains only a few keys and I need a random key. I\nnoticed this \"issue\" while testing this:\n\nfor k, _ := range mySmallMap {\n    return k\n}\n\nI was predicting the unpredictable.\n\nInstead I could:\n\ni := 0\nn := rand.Intn(len(mySmallMap))\nfor k, _ := range mySmallMap {\n    if n = i {\n        return k\n    }\n    i++\n}\n\nI'm not sure if this has the performance advantages of a larger map using\nonly the first key given by a range loop. I'm also not sure I care about\nthat right now.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\n-b\u003c/pre\u003e",
