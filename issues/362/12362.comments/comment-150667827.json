And so on.\n\nencoding/binary handles []uint8 (akak []byte) because it handles the general case of slice of fixed-size-integer. That is, the same code handles []uint16, []uint32, and []uint64. While we could add string, it would be a special case and one that I think would confuse people more than it would help.\n\nBecause of the general case, it would be silly to remove support for []uint8 as a special case. But at the same time I don't think it makes sense to add a special case for string. Instead of binary.Write(w, binary.LittleEndian, s), use w.Write([]byte(s)) or io.WriteString. That's much clearer and doesn't make one wonder how exactly it's important that the string is written in little-endian format.",
