Now, I kind of know. C++ is dynamically assessing the cost of the execution\nand chooses the algo that fits most. Almost like how SQL is executed in a database. I\nread your papers regarding regexp multiple times last week and read the source of the\ncurrent \"regexp\" package. The currently code implements Thompson's algo faithfully. I\ncould not have imagined a better way to improve it. But adding \"backtracking\" to the\nassessment will do! I hate to see Go's current regexp is slower than PHP and Python in\neasy cases. Once \"backtracking\" is added, more Rubist, Python writer and PHP writer\nwould have one less excuse to switch over. \n\nThanks for your outstanding papers that make me understand regexp more clearly!\n\nPlease add \"backtracking\" into the coming releases.\n\nBest Regards,\nGoPro\u003c/pre\u003e",
