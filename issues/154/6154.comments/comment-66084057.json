I realise now how naive I was; it might be a good idea though to explain this\nin more detail in the docs: \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/install/gccgo\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/install/gccgo\u003c/a\u003e\n\nAs I understand it, right now gccgo can only safely interact with C via SWIG since\nthere's no CGO support yet. The strange thing is that my C library is very complex and\ndoes indeed sleep (mutexes, rwlocks, swapcontext()'s) but so far I haven't seen any\nproblems with gccgo. Guess the fact that I haven't set GOMAXPROCS beyond 1 has to do\nwith it.\n\nI'm now looking at 6g + cgo since SWIG seems very clunky for implementing a C-to-Go\ncallback. Unfortunately swapcontext() seems to give cgo a hard time--I've just opened\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/6203\"\u003eissue #6203\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e",
