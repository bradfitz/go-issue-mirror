My understanding then is that in the crash case, it's detected that the pointer is to `buf.bootstrap`, but it doesn't know it's a slice so it checks the whole `buf` object. When using the `slice` variable, the pointer is still the same, but here it knows it's a slice and checks only that part of the memory. I suppose that makes sense.",
