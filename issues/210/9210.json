	"body": "by **momchil.dev**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat does 'go version' print?\n\ngo version go1.4rc2 darwin/amd64\n\nWhat happened?\n\nI am compiling a shared library for android/arm. I then use this library from a\nJava-based android application. \n\nWhen I run the application on a Nexus 5 device with Lollipop, I get a\n\u0026quot;libexample.so has text relocations. This is wasting memory and prevents security\nhardening. Please fix.\u0026quot;\n\nIf I run the same application on an old Kitkat Asus Transformer Pad TF301T, I don't get\nany errors at all and everything works as expected.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI don't have much experience in developing native libraries but the fact that it works\non one device and not the other seems strange.\n\nYou can find the code for the library here:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/momchil-atanasov/go-android-lib\"\u003ehttps://github.com/momchil-atanasov/go-android-lib\u003c/a\u003e\nYou can find the code for the android app here:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/momchil-atanasov/go-android-app\"\u003ehttps://github.com/momchil-atanasov/go-android-app\u003c/a\u003e\n\nHope this helps! Can't wait for the official release of 1.4.\u003c/pre\u003e",
