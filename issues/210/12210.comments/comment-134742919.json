Go 1.4.2 builds successfully with gcc -std=gnu99 but misc/cgo/test has the same failure when building Go 1.5 using the gnu89 Go-1.4.2.\r\n\r\nAs for running the test manually, I found out what is going wrong (or right): it's testing $GOROOT_FINAL/misc/cgo/test/cgo_test.go (that I patched to comment out all cgo tests so I could install), not the unpatched one in the build directory which fails. When I copy the unpatched one back to $GOROOT_FINAL, I can reproduce the error and will get back to bisecting the cgo tests.",
