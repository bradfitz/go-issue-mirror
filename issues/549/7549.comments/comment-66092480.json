Currently each word in the frame is marked as either nopointer,\npointer, iface, or eface.  I propose to mark each word with 0=dead, 1=scalar, 2=pointer,\n3=multiword.\n\nFor multiword entries, the entry for the following word encodes 0=string, 1=slice,\n2=iface, 3=eface.\n\nThat way we can do the correct thing for all the entries on the stack.  (The additional\ndead/scalar distinction will allow us to add tests to write bit patterns to claimed dead\nslots to see if the claim is correct.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
