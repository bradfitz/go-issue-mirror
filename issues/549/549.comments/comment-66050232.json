I originally thought that the hang was unrelated to the crash, but now I am \nthinking it might be two symptoms of the same bug.\n\nIf you would like to try and reproduce the bug, I have attached the source code, make \nfiles, and a torrent file (this is for the  Ubuntu 10.4 alpha 1 iso image, which may not \nremain an active torrent for very much longer, but it's what I used to repro the bug.)\n\nRepro steps:\n\nUnzip attached directory somewhere\nbash make.bash\nbash test.bash\nWait 10 minutes to see if the crash or hang reproduces.\n(You may need to fiddle with the test.bash script depending on whether or not you \nare testing on a network that has UPnP enabled or not.)\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/549/1/Taipei-Torrent.zip\"\u003eTaipei-Torrent.zip\u003c/a\u003e (387610 bytes)",
