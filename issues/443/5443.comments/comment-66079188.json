It takes a much longer time to get the crash (after 76,000\nrequests are handled), and I see the crash when I send log output stderr (I think stderr\nintroduces some more timing issues that help see the crash). I've attached the log once\nthe crash occurred. The gdb out is shown inline below (note it is different). \n\nI'd also run w/ Debug=2 now and see if something jumps out / makes sense to me.\n\nIf not, I can package the built app and send to you privately along with the\ndependencies so you can reproduce on your machines. What email address can I send it to?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5443/5/stack-and-gdb-out-GOMAXPROCS-eq-1.txt\"\u003estack-and-gdb-out-GOMAXPROCS-eq-1.txt\u003c/a\u003e (56204 bytes)",
