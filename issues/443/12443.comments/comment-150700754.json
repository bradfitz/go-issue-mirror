	"body": "I think the root of this issue is that go doesn't honour the whole $CC environment variable. OpenEmbedded (poky) sets the CC variable to the whole command needed to compile for a given target. Its compiler and linker binaries are generic, and need to be told about their target platforms. On my system CC is:\r\n\r\nCC=\"arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-gcc  -march=armv7-a -marm  -mthumb-interwork -mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=neon -mtune=cortex-a9 --sysroot=/oe/build/tmp-glibc/sysroots/wandboard\"\r\n\r\nbut when go runs it only runs arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-gcc for linking. Is that the intended behaviour, or is this this a bug?",
