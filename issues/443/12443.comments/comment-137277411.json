	"body": "The output of GCC -dumpspecs shows that your compiler will only use ld-linux-armhf.so.3 when the -mfloat-abi=hard option is used.  You need to arrange for your Go code to pass that option to the external linker.  The easiest way to do that is to add `#cgo LDFLAGS: -mfloat-abi=hard` to your import \"C\" comment.  You probably want to also add `#cgo CFLAGS: -mfloat-abi=hard`.\r\n\r\nClosing this because I don't think Go can do any better.  Please feel free to reopen if you think there is something we can do.",
