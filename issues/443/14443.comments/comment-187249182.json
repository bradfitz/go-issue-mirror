It would require a custom calling convention.\r\n\r\nWe typically do:\r\n\r\n   CMP index, bound\r\n   JAE fail\r\n\r\nfail:\r\n   CALL panicindex\r\n\r\nSo inside panicindex the stack doesn't tell you what registers the index and bound are in.  Or even if they are in registers; one of them may be a constant or be in memory.\r\nIf we forced both index and bounds to be in registers, maybe we could add functions like panicindex_rax_rcx - they could save the named registers somewhere before using standard Go to construct the panic message.\r\n\r\nIt's certainly a whole lot easier to just do:\r\n\r\nfail:\r\n    MOV index, 0(SP)\r\n    MOV bound, 8(SP)\r\n    CALL panicindex\r\n\r\nJust a question of whether that extra code is worth it.",
