By iteratively deleting\nignored files in my segfaulting tree, I determined that the leftover files that cause\nthis problem are the old binaries in $GOROOT/bin.\n\nMy diagnosis is that I probably set $GOBIN to some external path after including\n$GOROOT/bin in my $PATH. My clean.bash never deleted the $GOROOT/bin binaries, and my\nmake.bash never overwrote them. As a suggestion to prevent this happening in the future,\nmake.bash could write to both $GOROOT/bin and $GOBIN, maybe with hard links.\u003c/pre\u003e",
