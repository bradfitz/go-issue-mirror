	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIt happens that people subtract times more than 292 years apart (usually because of use\nof the zero time), resulting in an incorrect Duration. The current subtraction does not\ncheck for overflow so the duration wraps and may be positive or negative but is\ncertainly not correct.\n\nWe can't return the correct answer, but we could help avoid surprises by clamping the\nresult of Sub to -maxDuration or +maxDuration.\n\nThis would apply to time.Since as well.\n\nToo late for Go 1.1. Probably do for Go 1.2.\u003c/pre\u003e",
