Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\ngo version go1.7 linux/amd64\r\ngo version go1.7 windows/amd64\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\n\r\nOpen a shiny window, log key events received, press ctrl+C on the window.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nI expected the value of event/key.Event.Rune to be the same on linux and windows\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nOn linux ctrl+C produces the rune 'c', on windows 0x3 is reported instead. This isn't limited to 'c' all ctrl+key combinations produce different results on windows and linux. I think that the value of Rune should either be the same across platforms or always set to -1 when ctrl is pressed.\r\n",
