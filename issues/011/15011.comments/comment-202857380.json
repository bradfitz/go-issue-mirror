	"body": "From what i remember when changing ParseDuration it does not use infinite precision math: \r\nEverything after the . is read in as an int64 and then scaled to get a duration in nanoseconds.\r\n\"12345678912345678912\" overflows int64 but \"1234567891234567891\" as int64 does not. \r\nWhether 0.12345678912345678912 or 0.1234567891234567891 is used does not seem to make a difference for the duration as both would at the end result in the same duration, 444444440844 nanoseconds. So in principle one could parse more digits only to discard them since they have no affect on the final duration in nanoseconds. Not sure if that would be preferred since it gives an even more false sense of how accurate the parsed duration really is.",
