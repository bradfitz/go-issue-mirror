I was also thinking about a map of bool values as a bad example too.\n\nSad though, since Iverson's idea is so beautiful in mathematics and in APL, it would be\nunfortunate to copy his work and introduce a different notation.\n\nOne thing from his idea that I did not mention but is very important in the math\ncontext, is the notion of \"[p]\" being \"very strongly zero\" (as DEK phrases it) to mean\nthat a false predicate essentially suppresses the evaluation of things it is multiplied\nby, so that \"sum [n \u003e 0]/n\" never divides by zero. In a coding sense this is an analog\nto the \"shortcut\" \u0026\u0026 and || logical evaluation operators of the C-language family.\n\nAdding this WOULD be a big psychological step for some users, since \u0026\u0026 and || puzzle\nsome people.\u003c/pre\u003e",
