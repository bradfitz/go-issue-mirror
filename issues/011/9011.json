	"body": "by **smyrman**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the\nlatest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat does 'go version' print?\n\ngo version go1.3.3 linux/amd64\n\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\n\nUsing the following configuration:\n- OS: Arch Linux\n- Web browser: Chrome Version 38.0.2125.104 (64-bit)\n- Keyboard layout: US Internationl AltGr Unicode combining\n\n1. Edit the code in a present \u0026quot;.play\u0026quot; snippet.\n2. Add a new code line by using Enter (not shift enter).\n3.  Click Run...\n\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe compiler don't detect the newline added by Enter, and the snippet compilation fails.\nE.g.:\n\n    prog.go:10: syntax error: unexpected name, expecting semicolon or newline or }\n    [process exited with non-zero status]\n    Program exited.\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nThe newline should have been detected, and the program should have compiled.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI tested to use Chrome Inspect elements, and I can see that using\n\u0026quot;shift+Enter\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Enter\u0026quot;, have slightly different effect on the\nedited HTML.\n\nAdding a line with Shift + Enter works, and the snippet runs. Adding a file with just\nEnter, creates a new \u0026quot;\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, element, and the snipet don't run (unless\nsemicolons are manually adde to the end of the line).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/9011/0/original.png\"\u003eoriginal.png\u003c/a\u003e (13618 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/9011/0/added_line_with_shift_enter.png\"\u003eadded_line_with_shift_enter.png\u003c/a\u003e (14761 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/9011/0/added_line_with_just_enter.png\"\u003eadded_line_with_just_enter.png\u003c/a\u003e (21574 bytes)",
