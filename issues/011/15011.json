	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo 1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nUbuntu x64 but it fails on play.golang.org too.\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nI ran http://play.golang.org/p/N0A7ph_xkj which contains a large string (not really that large) to be parsed. \r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nDuration parsed with no errors. It works if you remove the last number of duration. \r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n2009/11/10 23:00:00 time: invalid duration 0.12345678912345678912h\r\n",
