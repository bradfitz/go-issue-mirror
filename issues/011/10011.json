	"title": "build: permission problems with distro-provided go and -installsuffix",
	"body": "With go 1.4 a developer has to use also an -installsuffix option if they want to have a static build (as told in #9344). Passing -installsuffix results in a directory creation in GOROOT/pkg with that suffix, so static std library can be stored there (I believe). The problem is that using this option is not possible with go provided by a distro (unless developer is a root, which is unlikely), because GOROOT is usually something like /usr/lib/golang.\r\n\r\nCalling `go get -a -tags netgo -ldflags -w -installsuffix nocgo \u003cproject\u003e` produces following error:\r\n`go install runtime: mkdir /usr/lib/golang/pkg/linux_amd64_nocgo/: permission denied`\r\n\r\nNot sure if that is fixable, but maybe specifying a GOPKG env var would be a viable option/workaround? GOPKG env var would be for GOROOT/pkg like GOBIN is now for GOROOT/bin. Then the invocation would look like this:\r\n`GOPKG=\"$HOME/some/dir\" go get -a -tags netgo -ldflags -w -installsuffix nocgo \u003cproject\u003e`\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
