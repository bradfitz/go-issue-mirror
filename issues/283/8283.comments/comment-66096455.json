The Stat is irrelevant.\" \u0026lt;-\nThis is the bug. The stat isn't irrelevant! The code is not distinguishing between the\nerror it assumes stat will return (file doesn't exist) and all the other possible errors\nstat could return (but it wouldn't know, it never checks!)\n\nMark it as \"not going to fix\" or reassign to somebody who cares about returning the\ncorrect error because it matters.\n\nI ran into the bug while writing disk/filesystem stress testing code. Getting the\ncorrect error matters to me as that is the point of the software and is a normal\noccurrence since I'm testing over a petabyte a week.\n\nIn any case, I long ago stopped using this function in my code.\u003c/pre\u003e",
