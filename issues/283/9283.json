	"body": "According to thishttp://opensource.apple.com/source/Git/Git-17/Git.plist,  the git on OS X might be as old as 1.7.4.4.\r\n\r\nI know on OS X 10.8.5, git version shows:\r\n```\r\ngit version 1.7.12.4 (Apple Git-37)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor exmaple, git-branch -q is introduced in https://github.com/git/git/commit/f9a482e62b079cdf9e80889011b6f41f3c17f0c2, which first appreas in 1.7.11. There might be OS X user with older version of git.\r\n\r\nBecause we still support OS X 10.6, ideally we should support the version of Git on 10.6.\r\n\r\nThe relevant golang-nuts question: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/vKwVKAXdrWg/UzKRkQFwPycJ",
