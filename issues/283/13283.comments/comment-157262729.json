It looks like to match glibc's behavior, we'll need to call InterfaceAddrs and find the enclosing IPNet that way.  (Which is basically how glibc finds IPv4 prefix lengths anyway.)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we just skip Rule 9 for IPv4 addresses.  I would suspect in practice it doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nCC @bradfitz ",
