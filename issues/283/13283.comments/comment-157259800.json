I'm not sure what to make of that.~~\r\n\r\n~~Does the getaddrinfo/getnameinfo implementation on Linux not implement rule 9? Does it want a full octet match for a matching prefix? Or some other interpretation of the rule I am not understanding?~~\r\n\r\nOne thing I see in the RFC is this:\r\n```\r\nRules 9 and 10 MAY be superseded if the implementation has other\r\n   means of sorting destination addresses.  For example, if the\r\n   implementation somehow knows which destination addresses will result\r\n   in the \"best\" communications performance.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn practice, the behavior of routing by \"best prefix\" in this context is problematic, as it causes a significant amount of traffic to be pointed at a small subset of nodes that otherwise have no meaningful routing value over the others.",
