	"body": "by **Zachary.Drew**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat does 'go version' print?\n\ngo1.3\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\n\nDifficult to reproduce but easy to understand. The underlying block device is returning\n\u0026quot;input/output error\u0026quot;. In my case, the \u0026quot;input/output error\u0026quot; is caused\nby a failed hardware RAID block device. I am seeing the incorrect error when I try to\ncreate a directory on the file system of the failed block device.\n\nerr := os.MkdirAll( \u0026quot;/failed-file-system-mount-point/subdirectory-to-create\u0026quot;,\n0755 )\n\nWhat happened?\n\nos.MkdirAll is returning \u0026quot;file exists\u0026quot; error on the mount point of the failed\nfilesystem:\n\nmkdir /failed-file-system-mount-point: file exists\n\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nos.MkdirAll should have returned \u0026quot;input/output error\u0026quot;:\n\nmkdir /failed-file-system-mount-point/subdirectory-to-create: input/output error\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThe root cause is that os.MkdirAll calls os.Stat but doesn't properly check the returned\nerror starting at line 21 in src/pkg/os/path.go. It assumes that the error returned is\n\u0026quot;file exists\u0026quot; when it could actually be some other error such as\n\u0026quot;input/output error\u0026quot;.\u003c/pre\u003e",
