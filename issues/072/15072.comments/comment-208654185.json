My internet connection at home dropped, so the buildlet was not able to connect to the coordinator.  After a few attempts, the service dropped into maintenance mode with this in the log.  \"Restarting too quickly, changing state to maintenance\".  How can I configure the service to not do this?\r\n\r\nI've got the following in the manifest, because I thought it would allow like 10,000 restarts in a second before failing, but that doesn't seem to be the case:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u003cproperty_group name=\"startd\" type=\"framework\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cpropval name='critical_failure_count' type='integer' value='10000'/\u003e\r\n  \u003cpropval name='critical_failure_period' type='integer' value='1'/\u003e\r\n\u003c/property_group\u003e\r\n```",
