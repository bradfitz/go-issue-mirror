You'd have to run it inside VirtualBox or something else, which I'm uncertain whether that it is possible if the EC2 instances are themselves virtualized (I don't know).\r\n\r\n@jtsylve standard disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice, and I am not a spokesperson for my employer.\r\n\r\nWith that said, the short version is that you may use the version downloaded from the Oracle Technology Network with this primary limitation (from the link that @jtsylve provided, which is the correct one):\r\n\r\n\u003e ... limited License to use the Programs only for the purpose of developing, testing, prototyping and demonstrating your applications, and not for any other purpose.\r\n\r\nHowever, please be aware that (generally speaking) no security fixes or other updates are provided without a support contract, so any running instance of that version should be secured accordingly with that in mind.  I hope that more favorable terms are available in the future for development/testing licenses.",
