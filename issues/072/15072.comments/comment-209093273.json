	"body": "I fixed the issue.  The buildlet restarts too often for startd's liking.  It puts it in maintenance mode after 5 restarts.  The `critical_failure_count` and `critical_failure_period` seem like additions to SmartOS and not Oracle Solaris.  I solved the problem by just running the buildlet in a loop in the startup script.  (See: https://golang.org/cl/21791)\r\n\r\n@bradfitz Can you check on the status of the builder?  I think I may have disabled it somehow.  The buildlet is connected to the coordinator, but is no longer getting new assignments.\r\n\r\nThe last log mentions this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2016-04-12T02:10:41Z finish_start_tests after 54.654536667s; err=Buildlet http://solaris reverse peer solaris/174.70.120.206:61429 for modes [solaris-amd64-oraclejtsylve] failed heartbeat after 10.000822451s; marking dead; err=timeout waiting for headers; solaris: [test:3_5]\r\n2016-04-12T02:10:41Z main_buildlet_broken solaris\r\n```",
