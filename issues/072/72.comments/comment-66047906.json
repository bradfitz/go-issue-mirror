The two are sufficiently\ndifferent that I don't think it's important to\nmerge them.  Obviously more complex interfaces\nare possible but they're not clearly necessary.\n\nWe've recently fixed the \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/512\"\u003eissue #512\u003c/a\u003e complaint\nabout uint64 vs int64.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
