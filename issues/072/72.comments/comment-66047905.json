It states another problem\nwhich needs to be addressed. In what format should we hold nanoseconds?\ntime.Nanoseconds() returns an int64 while os.Dir.Mtime is a uint64. That is another\nexample of where time data is handled inconsistently, but it is also a different\nproblem from this issue report.\u003c/pre\u003e",
