I assume that you are passing the options -pipe -O3\n-floop-interchange -ftree-loop-distribution -floop-strip-mine -floop-block\n-ftree-vectorize yourself, since the dist program does not use those by default.  Since\nwe are converting the programs to Go in any case, I don't think this is worth fixing.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
