	"body": "by **odysseus9672**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat does 'go version' print?\ngo version go1.3beta2 +708e129e91a9 Wed May 21 16:01:54 2014 -0700 darwin/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n1. Go does not support the hex encoded floats produceable from the C verb %a in stdio.h\nand float.hex/float.fromhex in Python.\n2. Example numbers:\npi = 0x1.921fb54442d18p+1\n-e = -0x1.5bf0a8b145769p+1\n15.39453125 = f.65 = 0x1.eca0000000000p+3\n2^-1070 = 0x0.0000000000010p-1022\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/446DOTlpbw\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/446DOTlpbw\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat happened?\nA bunch of errors.\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI know that Go implements an equivalent syntax in the %b verb, but having %a would be\nnice for cross compatibility with C, Python, and Java. The best part is that producing\nthe FormatFloat part of the code is trivial. The tricky part is, as always, getting the\nparser to work right.\u003c/pre\u003e",
