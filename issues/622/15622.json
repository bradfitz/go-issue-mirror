	"body": "Using `9af83462`\r\n\r\nThe recent changes to `compress/flate` has provided pretty good improvements overall to the compression speeds, but I have noticed a few extraordinary cases where the compression ratio suffers significantly.\r\n\r\nThis [spreadsheet compares the output sizes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15kBp7rWX4FhC3K4CK0-mOsMObVOK_e0-3D97p_sWFBg/edit?usp=sharing) from go1.6 to current go.tip on a number of compression benchmarks. All tests were done using the `flate.DefaultCompression` setting.\r\n\r\nMost notably, the [clegg.tiff image from the ACT corpus](http://compression.ca/act/act-files.html) experiences a 44% increase in output size (511928 to 741046 bytes).\r\n\r\nI think it would be worthwhile to understand what causes this fairly significant regression in compression ratio before the go1.7 release.\r\n\r\ncc @nigeltao @klauspost \r\n",
