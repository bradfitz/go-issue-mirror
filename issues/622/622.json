What do you see instead?\nAccording to the comments \u0026quot;GetHeader returns the value of the response \nheader with the given key, and true.\u0026quot; the GetHeader() should return two \nvalues. But here it returns one.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n$GOOS=linux\n$GOARCH=amd64\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?

If there were multiple headers with this key, their \n// values are concatenated, with a comma delimiter.  If there were no \n// response headers with the given key, it returns the empty string and \n// false.
