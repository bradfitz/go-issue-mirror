It certainly sounds plausible that these are RGB 3-tuples in an uncompressed TIFF.\r\n\r\nI agree that we don't need to revert 4-byte hashing yet.\r\n\r\nFor example, TIFF is not as common as it used to be, and more modern image formats use 2D-image-specific filtering before passing to a general purpose compressor like DEFLATE; those filters already take out any easy repeated-RGB-3-tuple wins. Using the standard library's image/png encoder yields 501111 bytes, smaller than both 511928 and 741046. WEBP Lossless (generated by the cwebp tool) is 379612 bytes.",
