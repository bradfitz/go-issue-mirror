I thought based on the way the [doc I found](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8kOo3r51b2BWtTs_1uADIA5djfXhPT36s6eHVRIvaU/edit) was written, it didn't matter where 'internal' was in the chain of the package name.\r\n\r\nIs it just a weird edge case where vendoring and internal packages don't play nice that's not easy to fix? Cause it works fine without vendoring.\r\n\r\nIf this isn't ever going to be fixed, that's okay, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what's going on that's causing the issue.",
