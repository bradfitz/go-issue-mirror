This can\nprobably be done purely at a syntactic level, without recourse to any type checking.\n\nx == y || x == y\nis a redundant test, assuming neither x nor y contains function calls or channel\noperations.\n\nx != y || x != z\nis not guaranteed to be wrong but almost always is. If y and z are the same then it's\nredundant; if y and z are different then it's always true.\u003c/pre\u003e",
