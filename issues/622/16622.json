	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n1.6.3\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/home/sean/Code/Go\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/usr/local/go\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64\"\r\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\"1\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nCreated a repository named 'internal', to hold organization-level packages for a project of microservices and api clients ( \"github.com/seanhagen/internal\", example package \"github.com/seanhagen/internal/tokens\" )\r\n\r\nInside of a project using vendored dependencies ( via godep ), attempt to import a package from internal repo.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nBinary to compile without issue.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage github.com/seanhagen/test\r\n        imports github.com/seanhagen/internal/tokens: use of internal package not allowed\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when the vendor folder is removed, `go build` works fine. It seems that because the internal package is now located at `vendor/github.com/seanhagen/internal/session`, `go build` thinks that the files I'm trying to build are outside that tree/scope, and blocks the import of the internal package.\r\n\r\nIt also works when just the `github.com/seanhagen/internal` folder is removed from the vendor folder.",
