	"body": "\u003e why http.Server.Serve method doesn't returns an error when an invalid cipher sequence is used like on the following example?\r\n\r\nBecause you used different *tls.Config values for the http.Server and the TLS listener you manually created and passed to `http.Server.Serve(net.Listener)`. Note that `crypto/tls.NewListener` doesn't return an inspectable type. The http package can't tell that what its TLS config is.\r\n\r\nThere's not much we can do here. At least we'll catch it later at connection accept time. Good enough.\r\n\r\nWhat you can do though is not pass different TLS configs. Or just use ListenAndServeTLS and don't worry about creating your own listener.\r\n",
