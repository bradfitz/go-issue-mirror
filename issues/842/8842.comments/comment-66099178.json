Something like:\n~/.go/gopath/\n2) [OPTIONAL] In the installer, present a SKIPPABLE option to allow users who care to\nspecify a custom GOPATH\n3) [OPTIONAL] Store options like GOPATH in a configuration file.  Something like:\n~/.go/goconfig.json\n\nI just made up the above names.  I don't know your system.  I'm sure other names would\nmake more sense.\n\nThe above steps would:\na) make it possible for new users (like me) to get started more easily\nb) provide customization for advanced users\nc) make the system functional without environment variables\n\nFYI: GOPATH seems to be a big problem for prospective new users.
