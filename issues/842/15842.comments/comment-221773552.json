For example, if\r\n\r\n    CurrentTime  ::=  GeneralizedTime\r\nthen any of the following three values of CurrentTime are valid: ``20001231235959.999'' is 1/1000 second before the end of the 20th century local time; ``20001231205959.999Z'' is the universal time three hours different from the above local time; and ``20001231235959.999+0300'' indicates the local time is three hours ahead of universal time.\r\n",
