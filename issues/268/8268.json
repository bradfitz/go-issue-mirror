Hence the bug tracker.  \nI know that this may not be the best place to report such issues. I had found two more\nminor corrections in the documentation (from-form typos) but I've forgotten where. If\nyou let me know the right place to report, I will use it. \n\nIf the spec is right and I am wrong, please correct my understanding.\n\nThank you.\u003c/pre\u003e",
