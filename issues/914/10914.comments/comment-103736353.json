We could change .gopclntab to not require relocs but the same affects the .rodata and .typelink sections and I think those are harder.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to change the linker to make .gopclntab/.rodata/.typelink read-write, but that just makes the external linker lump everything into one RWE segment which isn't really what we want.",
