	"body": "I would guess that you are using GNU ld rather than gold.  GNU ld sorts sections by name using a default linker script.  It will put the .rodata section and the .text section in the same segment.  If .rodata is writable, that forces the segment to be writable.  At that point there is no need to make a separate data segment, so you wind up with a single segment.  This is obviously bad.\r\n\r\nHaving a DT_TEXTREL tag is also bad.  It means that the shared library text segments can not be shared--in other words, the shared libraries are not shared.",
