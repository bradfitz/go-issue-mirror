A section with that name, when linked with -z relro, will be placed at the start of the data segment in such a way that the dynamic linker can mark it as readonly after applying dynamic relocations (the dynamic linker is told what to make readonly via a PT_GNU_RELRO segment).\r\n\r\nSections whose names are not recognized, like .pclntab, etc., will, if writable, be treated as ordinary writable sections and placed in the data segment.\r\n\r\nThe problem leading to the single segment was due to a section with a special name (.rodata) having unexpected flags.",
