	"body": "Internally, `m-\u003eprocid` is set by the OS specific functions defined by the Go runtime such as `runtime.clone` on Linux. These functions are not called when using cgo, preferring instead the C version.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to set `m-\u003eprocid` in the various `runtime.minit` functions that are OS specific? That would ensure `m-\u003eprocid` is always set, as I assume `runtime.minit` will always be called for any new thread.",
