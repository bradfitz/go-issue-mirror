If it's not true, then I think there is nothing to do here. I admit that I took the report at face value and did not investigate whether that is true.\r\n\r\nI agree @alexbrainman that TestRenameOverwriteDest seems to suggest this example already works. Given that, I think we can close the bug. Sorry for the confusion.\r\n\r\n",
