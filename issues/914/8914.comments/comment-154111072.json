	"body": "This bug was originally created asking for an os.Replace with consistent behavior on Windows, because #3366 (fix os.Rename) was closed as impossible. \n\nI'm changing the topic of this bug to fix os.Rename, effectively replacing #3366. I don't believe package os should be inventing new functionality, but I do think that it should strive for consistent functionality in what's there. (There is for example another open bug for making os.RemoveAll work with read-only files on Windows.)\n\nBased on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/167414/is-an-atomic-file-rename-with-overwrite-possible-on-windows it looks like it may be possible to just fix os.Rename on Windows. In particular, it sounds like ReplaceFile is the right call to make.\n\nIf we decide that it is truly impossible to implement os.Rename on Windows then we could fall back to a discussion of a new function, but I'd rather take all the existing code using os.Rename and make it start working than make it obsolete.",
