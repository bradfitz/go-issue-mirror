	"body": "Go's standard library doesn't provide any API to access a monotonic clock source, which means one can't reliably time how long an operation takes without copy-pasting or importing some low-level platform-dependent code such as the `clock` package at https://github.com/davecheney/junk.\r\n\r\nThis API doesn't necessarily need to return a `time.Time`, just returning a number of nanoseconds as a `uint64` would be enough, kinda like Java's [`System.nanoTime()`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#nanoTime--).",
