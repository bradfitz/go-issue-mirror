It's turned up two bugs though:\n\ngotest -test.run=TestFuzzBug1\npanic: runtime error: makeslice: len out of range [recovered]\n        panic: interface conversion: interface is runtime.errorString, not gob.gobError\n\ngotest -test.run=TestFuzzBug2\nan infinite loop or something that takes a really long time.\n\nIt's tricky to build more tests at present because I frequently hit one of these two.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2689/10/fuzz_test.go\"\u003efuzz_test.go\u003c/a\u003e (1348 bytes)",
