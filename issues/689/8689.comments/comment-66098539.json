However, the current spec is reasonably\neasy to understand and reasonably easy to implement\n(\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/ref/spec#Package_initialization)\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/ref/spec#Package_initialization)\u003c/a\u003e.  For cases that can work even\nthough the language spec does not permit them, you can write an init function.  This is\nan area where simplicity and ease of understanding seems more important than trying to\npermit every possible case.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
