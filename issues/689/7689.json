	"body": "by **charlieandrews.cwa**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI was working with the \u0026quot;net/rpc\u0026quot; package using the default gob client/server\ncodec. Requests were being sent fine and all responses were being returned fine, except\nfor one, which would just hang. I could see that everything was going fine until it went\nto write the response. I traced the issue all the way to the\ngobServerCodec.WriteResponse function in \u0026quot;net/rpc/server.go\u0026quot;. I put some log\nlines in, and noticed that it encoded the Response just fine, but errored on the\nencoding of the body. It seems that there was no way for me to know it errored on the\nbody unless I had debugLog set to true (which there doesn't seem to be a nice way to\ndo), or put a log line in there. Is there a way that the order that the Response and\nbody get encoded could be switched, so that if an error occurs while encoding the body,\nit will be reported in Response.Error ? I think the change would be trivial, so I will\ndo it if others think that I am correct in thinking that this is a bug.\u003c/pre\u003e",
