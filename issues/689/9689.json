My biggest issue is that despite the fact the designers call Strftime bad because no one remembers the letters, and has to have documentation handy - the Go docs don't even document the magic numbers you have to use.\r\nWhy 2006? How do I represent a day? When do I use _2 vs 2? Its very poorly documented and thankfully all I use is RFC3339 and Unix timestamps.\"\r\n",
