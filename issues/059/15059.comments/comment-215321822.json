	"body": "It is indeed an invalid GIF image: the frame's palette only has 128 entries (i.e. valid values are from 0 to 127 inclusive), but the 'transparent index' is given as 128, which is outside the range [0, 127]. The GIF spec at https://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt says in section 22, Table Based Image Data, \"Each index must be within the range of the size of the active color table\".\r\n\r\nImagemagick similarly complains:\r\n\r\n$ convert joker1.gif x.png\r\nconvert.im6: invalid colormap index `joker1.gif' @ error/colormap-private.h/ConstrainColormapIndex/34.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, it treats it as a warning, not an error. Furthemore, joker1.gif is viewable (with no visible error message) in both Firefox and Google Chrome, and by Eye-of-Gnome (which uses gdk-pixbuf). I suppose that it's a case of reality trumping the standard, and we should 'fix' this for Go.",
