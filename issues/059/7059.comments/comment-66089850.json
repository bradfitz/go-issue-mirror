That struct has Start and Len fields that (on\na 32 bit system) are either 32 bit (for F_GETLK) or 64 bit (for F_GETLK64).  So I think\nthe right thing to do is to implement Flock in the syscall package, and define it to\nmatch the version of F_GETLK.  That should happen automatically if we add Flock to\npkg/syscall/types_linux.go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
