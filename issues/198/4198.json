	"body": "by **deanm@chromium.org**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003ego version go1.0.2\n\nThe websocket server rejects requests (with a 400 status code) that do not include an\norigin header.  Browsers send an origin header, but for non-browsers there are some\nnotes about this in the spec (rfc6455):\n\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\nThis header field is sent by browser clients; for non-browser\n   clients, this header field may be sent if it makes sense in the\n   context of those clients.\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n\nBy default most non-browser websocket client APIs do not send an origin header, and it\nwould seem it's a better approach if the websocket server does not require one.\u003c/pre\u003e",
