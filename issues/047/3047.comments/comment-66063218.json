For variables that live entirely in registers, the stack entries\nare trimmed from the code and the linker doesn't generate debug info\nfor them.  This is a separate issue, marked 'later', and will require\nto generate some dwarf in the compiler, instead of in the linker as\nhappens now.  You can disable optimisation on the compiler with the -N\nflag while debugging, as a workaround.\u003c/pre\u003e",
