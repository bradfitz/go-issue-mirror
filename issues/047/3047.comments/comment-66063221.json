However, looking in more\ndetail at your crash report, i think it _is_ runtime-gdb.py specific, and unrelated to\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/2818\"\u003eissue #2818\u003c/a\u003e.  The problem may very well be that gdb is trying to dump the uninitialized\nreturn variables.  I will try to make the pretty printers robust against this and post a\nruntime-gdb.py to try out.\u003c/pre\u003e",
