If you delete the file $GOROOT/src/pkg/runtime/runtime-gdb.py\nthen the Go-specific extensions will not be loaded, and gdb might be happier.  I\ndefinitely tried that when I saw the Linux crash but I don't remember if it worked.\n\nMarking this as nice for Go 1 but not a must.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-go1**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to @lvdlvd._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
