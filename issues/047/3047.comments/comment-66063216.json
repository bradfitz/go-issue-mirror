If i set a breakpoint at main.main, run\n(hits that breakpoint) and then continue, the program ran fine, but if i just ran\ndirectly, it would crash, apparently after creating a thread.   building gdb 7.4 without\ntrhead support made the crash go away.  gdb 7.3 doesn't seem to have this problem.\u003c/pre\u003e",
