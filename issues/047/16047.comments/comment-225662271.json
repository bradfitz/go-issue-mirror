	"body": "The place to fix this is google-api-go-client.\r\n\r\nAdding an interface for `http.Client` in the http package does not seem right.  That suggests that other people will want to implement the interface.  Since they will do, it will be impossible for us in practice to add new methods to the `http.Client` interface, since that would break other packages.\r\n\r\nInstead, packages that want to use `http.Client`, and want to permit wrapping, should define their own interface, and use it.\r\n\r\nClosing because I don't think there is anything to do in the Go standard library.",
