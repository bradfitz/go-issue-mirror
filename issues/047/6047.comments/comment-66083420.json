This is not super\nsurprising given their shared code, but it is interesting nonetheless. Apparently all of\nthem added threads to the kernel without updating the profiling signal delivery to be\nthread-aware. (FreeBSD is fine at least, but they were one of the earliest to support\nthreads.)\n\nThe primary focus of the bug is still OS X. NetBSD and OpenBSD can and should fix their\nkernels. I have not submitted any reports to them, but if anyone wants to do so, the\ntest program you need is probably in the Apple Bug Report\n(\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/change/35b716c94225)\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/change/35b716c94225)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: removed **go1.2**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
