	"body": "@adonovan, profiling works fine on OS X if you patch your kernel, as I think most Go programmers on Macs do, out of necessity. Certainly people running non-buggy kernels don't need to see forced output on standard error every time they profile a program.\r\n\r\nIf we had good way to tell whether the kernel patch has been applied, we could print a warning in that case. But I don't have a good way to do that. I have thought about changing the kernel version string but the only thing I am confident about changing is the date, and there's not much room there to signal that the fix is applied.\r\n\r\nSee [rsc.io/pprof_mac_fix](https://rsc.io/pprof_mac_fix) for the patch.",
