But, if performance was a little worse that's something I could live with (in this particular instance performance is hardly a concern).\r\n\r\nHowever, the fact that usleep() gives up the rest of the time slice, is sort of a constant factor I reckon. That wouldn't yet explain why every once in a while it would lock up on sched_yield() right? Or for that matter, why your test program takes 25 times as long in some runs compared to other runs?",
