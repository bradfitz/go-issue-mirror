	"body": "I have to work with CSV files that only have a carriage return in them.  The csv package Readall method considers the whole file to be one record because it only checks for \"LF\" (/n) and has no check for \"CR\" as well.\r\n\r\nCSV files can end with just \"CR\" per these standards:  http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000323.shtml\r\n\r\nThank you!",
