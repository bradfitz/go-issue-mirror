	"body": "The menu bar of a gldriver program on darwin shows the name of the process as the first letter of the binary. The binary named helloworld would have a label of h. It looks like the box for the label itself is too narrow for the text. If you use a string like \"!!!\" for the name, it shows as \"!.\", as though it might decide the name is too long and replace it with \"!...\" but there's still only room for ! and one . .\r\n",
