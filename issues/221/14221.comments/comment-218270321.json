	"body": "No, you'd record the handshake on the underlying conn and return a new underlying conn which would eat those parts for the second *tls.Conn, so the net/http's use of the *tls.Listener thinks it's handshaking, but it's speaking to a script instead. You'd probably have to set the *tls.Config.Rand io.Reader to something deterministic between the two, using crypto/rand.Reader the first time, recording it too, and using the same randomness in the later one.\r\n\r\nI haven't actually implemented this, but it seems plausible. In any case, I'd prefer to see such hackery put into the code that is implementing a TLS mux, because it's already aware of TLS, rather than infecting APIs for everybody else.",
