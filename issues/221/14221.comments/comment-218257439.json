Maybe we shouldn't even \"fix\" this.\r\n\r\nGenerally people want this so they can use https://godoc.org/github.com/spacemonkeygo/openssl or something, but that's not something I really want to encourage.\r\n\r\nFor a mux, can't you record the traffic seen at the beginning of the handshake during routing and then replay it, stitching together the captured traffic and the underlying net.Conn, feeding that into https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#Server?\r\n\r\n@tamird, can I can get an update on the motivation for this bug?",
