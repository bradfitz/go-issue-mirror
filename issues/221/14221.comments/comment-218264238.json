This case is pretty rare because your mux usually wants to direct traffic based on the decrypted data read from the connection.\r\n\r\nYou want to be able to:\r\n```\r\nnet.Conn -\u003e tls.Conn -\u003e mux -\u003e something\r\n                         |\r\n                         -----\u003e something else\r\n```\r\nwhere `something` and `something else` both want to consume a **`net.Listener`** that yields `*tls.Conn`s (e.g. all the methods on `net/http.Server`). You can't have your mux listener double wrap the connection with `tls.Server` (or can you?), so you're stuck.",
