That will work poorly with the go tool because\nthe go tool discards the .o files, hence the error message you are seeing.  I believe\nthis issue is unrelated to the main problem here.  If you can open a new issue for the\nOS X specific problem, that would be helpful.  It would also be helpful if you could\nlook at the man page for the system linker and see if there is an option to tell it to\npull in debug info from .o files into the final executable.\u003c/pre\u003e",
