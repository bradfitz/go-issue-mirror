As for copying code that is then not lowered to opcodes (because of name change) it might also be the case that it does not produce equal results for some float math.\r\n\r\nSadly math.sqrt already seems to violate what you said. But i guess we can at least move math.Sqrt from frontend as intrinsic to the backend for cleanup since removing its special treatment would otherwise cause a performance regression. \r\n\r\nSo for now i have a look at lowering sqrt as an intrinsic and leave the rest alone :) (unless other reasons and candidates surface to handle more math functions as opcodes directly). If needed for compiler or runtime performance we could always have internal function names and lower only those.",
