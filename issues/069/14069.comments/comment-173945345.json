	"body": "Recounting this to @aclements I figured out what is going on with CMOVLEQ. The GNU form is `CMOV[cond][size]` but the form added for Go is `CMOV[size][cond]`. So GNU's cmovleq is cmov-le-q while Go's CMOVLEQ is CMOV-L-EQ. The Intel syntax has no size suffix and is CMOVEQ/CMOVLE, but it seems clear that Go should not be inserting a size _suffix_ in the _middle_ of the defined opcode name. While in general I feel that we need to put up with past mistakes in our assembly definitions to avoid breaking existing assembly programs, this one seems so egregious and error-prone that I think we have no choice but to change these names for Go 1.7 to match the Intel and GNU syntax.",
