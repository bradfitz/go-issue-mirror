However\nI can't share the instance I have, and haven't been able to create another one with this\nproperty. The fix that's in place now will still work, so this is just an academic point\nfor posterity.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/7069/4/zip64.zip\"\u003ezip64.zip\u003c/a\u003e (266 bytes)",
