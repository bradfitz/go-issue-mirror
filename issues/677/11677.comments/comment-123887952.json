The write barrier must be on before we enable assists, but since we turn it on in the scan phase, we can in principle enable assists quite early. Unfortunately, this introduces other problems. For example, it's possible for assists during the scan phase to drain everything we have so far and signal completion even though the scan is still collecting pointers. I can work around this, but this change still has deleterious effects I don't yet understand like doubling the duration and heap size of TestTraceStress.",
