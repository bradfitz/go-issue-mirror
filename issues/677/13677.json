	"body": "Debugging a hang in a program using Go 1.6.\nLooks like the sqlite3 driver has buggy cgo usage, which triggers a panic during a call to a driver method with one of the database/sql locks held. The panic invokes some deferred functions higher up the stack without unlocking the lock. Those functions try to get the lock for themselves and deadlock. Looks like maybe database/sql needs to use defer to guard its various calls into the driver.\n\nI started this for the driver.Stmt methods, but there are a lot.\n\n/cc @bradfitz",
