	"body": "The goal of the check there (which I only added relatively recently) was to make sure that NumGoroutine was not consistently different from than the number of stacks shown (because one includes system goroutines and one does not). The check is fundamentally racy in that they might see different pictures of the world. I sent CL 19002 to try to reduce the race window. That may be enough. We'll see. In any event I'm not worried about the failures, except as far as they are annoying. Hopefully that CL will cut the frequency enough. If not we can do a retry loop up to 10 times or something.\r\n",
