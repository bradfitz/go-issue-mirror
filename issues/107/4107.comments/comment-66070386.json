As a result, the relocation code actually checks the following symbol\nand if it does not have a type of STT_SECTION then the relocation is skipped.\nUnfortunately, all of the objects used for the existing relocation tests have symbols of\ntype STT_SECTION that follow the symbol that requires relocation, hence they relocate\ncorrectly.\n\nThere are two obvious fixes - stop skipping over the first symbol in the symbol table or\nadjust the index when performing relocation. I suspect the first of these is more\n\"correct\" since any data that contains an index into the symbol table will potentially\nencounter the same issue. Furthermore, code that uses debug/elf or debug/dwarf should\nnot need to know that they must adjust for this.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @4a6f656c._",
