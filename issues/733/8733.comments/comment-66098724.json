Then I set up a workspace to build the additional\n\"code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/...\". But there is no $GOPATH/bin/godoc.\n\nSo I tried to install it again by hand: `go install\ncode.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc` which exits silently(!) but does not install\nanything.\n\nNext step is to move cwd to the godoc directory and do a `go build`, which exits\nsilently and build a godoc, that actually works, but `go test` fails. `go install` in\nthat directory still fails and still does not report any error. The test says:\n\n2014/09/24 10:12:39 open $GOROOT/src/fmt: no such file or directory\n2014/09/24 10:12:39 lstat $GOROOT/src/fmt: no such file or directory\n2014/09/24 10:12:39 ReadFile: open $GOROOT/src/fmt/print.go: no such file or directory\n\nI assume this is somehow related to the original problem. But what disturbs me most,\nwith this error is the silence of `go install`, that actually does nothing.\n\nThe complete `go test \u003e test.out 2\u003e\u00261` is attached.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/8733/1/test.out\"\u003etest.out\u003c/a\u003e (30288 bytes)",
