I got confused by the cross\ninstall from GOPATH to GOROOT.\n\nI assume the src path error comes from a similar source. The `go test\ncode.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc` still fails and the source files are still mapped\nto a wrong path.\n\nAn update to the same release branch of code.google.com/p/go.tools in \"the\" GOPATH helps\nwith this source mapping too (with the original reported error): So\n\n   `(cd $GOPATH/src/code.google.com/p/go.tools; hg update release-branch.go1.3)`\n\nActually the `go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/...` moves you to the tip.\n\nIs there a way to tell get which branch it should `go get` get or even better if the\nuser automagically gets code.google.com/p/go.tools they should automagically update to\nthe same branch GOROOT is at.\u003c/pre\u003e",
