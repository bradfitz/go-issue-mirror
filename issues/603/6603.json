Is anyone\naware of such implementation?  The idea is to set there some rlimit of a process and\nsuch. \n\nIt would be interesting to have such feature.\n\n[1]\n\u003ca href=\"http://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html?highlight=subprocess#subprocess.Popen\"\u003ehttp://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html?highlight=subprocess#subprocess.Popen\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
