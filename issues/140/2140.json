(hg identify)\nbb28251f6da4+ weekly/weekly.2011-07-29\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThe default round tripper (cleverly) uses gzip encoding transparently when making\nupstream requests for a client that doesn't support compression.  The trouble is that it\nmutates the http.Request struct and doesn't put it back.  This breaks any software that\nlooks at the request after performing the round trip.\u003c/pre\u003e",
