In\nmail.ParseAddress, any character encodings other than utf-8 and iso-8859-1 are not\nhandled.\n\nIt would be nice to support windows-1252 with a preference towards being able to plug\nmore charsets in. (Perhaps, with a similar interface as go.text/transform#Transformer.)\n\nExample:\n\n\tstr := \u0026quot;=?windows-1252?Q?Michael_Bo=DFlet?= \u0026lt;michael.bosslet@example.com\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\n\ta, err := mail.ParseAddress(str)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\u0026quot;%s\u0026quot;, err)\n\t}\n\tlog.Printf(\u0026quot;%s\u0026quot;, a)\n\nThis will crash, unfortunately.\u003c/pre\u003e",
