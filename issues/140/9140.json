	"body": "by **Ephrones**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eDial() wants as addr a scheme as defined in \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/net/#Dial\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/pkg/net/#Dial\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nSendMail() calls Dial() internally, but without looking at its source one can only guess\nfrom the docstring what scheme it needs as addr.\n\nIt gets fun when you create a PlainAuth(), which wants a host (that is basically addr\nbut without the colon separated port). I thought: “Ah, already got that!” and put in\nmy addr from before. Now you get a rather meaningless “wrong host name” error.\nAs it turns out this one is thrown in net/smtp/auth.go because host doesn’t like the\nport.\n\nimho Dial() should have host and port as separate arguments, but I see that the API\ncan’t be changed now.\n\nSo I suggest the following:\n1. Clarify the docstrings (reference to Dial() in net in all Dial() docstrings and in\nSendMail)\n2. Improve “wrong host name” to Sprintf(\u0026quot;wrong host name (%s)\u0026quot;, hostname)\n\nPull request coming, will reference this issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
