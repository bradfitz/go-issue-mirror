This already works, because it doesn't have anything to do\nwith the go command.\n\nWhat you asked for in this issue is to be able to write the quoted\nversion, creating an environment variable that itself contains ~, and\nforce every program that looks at the environment variable to apply\nthe tilde expansion itself. That is not required by POSIX, and it is\nnot done by any shell I could find, except bash, which does\neverything.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
