With the\nexample above it seems the go tool creates $HOME/~/foobar/src/code.google.com/p, which\nseems like the right thing to do (although slightly unexpected to some people...) if you\nare not expanding the ~.\n\nHowever as in the example above it when it calls the mercurial command:\n\nhg clone -U \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go-tour\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go-tour\u003c/a\u003e ~/foobar/src/code.google.com/p/go-tour\n\nthe error message is:\n\nabort: No such file or directory: /home/kamil/foobar/src/code.google.com/p/go-tour/.hg\n\nwhich seems to imply that Mercurial does its own tilde expansion and so the paths don't\nmatch.\u003c/pre\u003e",
