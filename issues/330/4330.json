	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eSummary: If a package is present on GOPATH, godoc should find it, perhaps only after\nfailing to find it in GOROOT.\n\nI believe there are a number of related problems here, hard to tease out. The exact\nmeaning of the arguments to godoc is not well documented, which is part of it.\n\nBut the key point is that godoc is too aggressive about resolving those\n\u0026quot;names\u0026quot; inside $GOROOT even if $GOPATH is set, or even if it's not. On the\ncommand line at least, godoc seems to disregard GOPATH completely.\n\nExample (Ignore the fact my documentation is missing and just observe how godoc behaves):\n\n% cd\n% echo $GOROOT\n/Users/r/go\n% echo $GOPATH\n/Users/r\n% \n% cd rspace.cmd\n/Users/r/src/code.google.com/p/rspace.cmd  # IN GOPATH\n% ls\nAUTHORS\t\tLICENSE\t\tcodereview.cfg\tnow\t\ttypo\nCONTRIBUTORS\tREADME\t\tfreq\t\ttranslate\tunicode\n% godoc now  # WHY DOESN'T THIS WORK?\n2012/11/01 12:52:06 open /Users/r/go/src/pkg/now: no such file or directory  # TRUE BUT\n\u0026quot;now\u0026quot; EXISTS IN THIS DIRECTORY AND/OR ON GOPATH\n% godoc ./now # THIS DOES WORK, BUT IS FUSSY.\nPACKAGE\n\npackage main\n    import \u0026quot;./now\u0026quot;\n\n\ntubenose=% godoc ./unicode\nPACKAGE\n\npackage main\n    import \u0026quot;./unicode\u0026quot;\n\n\n% cd  # BACK HOME\n% godoc now\n2012/11/01 12:53:57 open /Users/r/go/src/pkg/now: no such file or directory  # WHAT\nABOUT GOPATH?\ntubenose=% godoc /Users/r/src/code.google.com/p/rspace.cmd/now/ # GIVE FULL PATH AND IT\nWORKS\nPACKAGE\n\npackage main\n    import \u0026quot;/Users/r/src/code.google.com/p/rspace.cmd/now/\u0026quot;\n\n%\u003c/pre\u003e",
