	"body": "The major challenge in a common API is that iOS has async, Android has sync APIs.\r\n\r\niOS provides notifiers for location and network reachability and notifies the main thread (or another delegate) about the changes. Notifiers should be on iff the application requires the be updated with the current state of the things. Otherwise, it's a battery-life problem.\r\n\r\nEven though permission models are different for the location APIs, we can always provide a noop implementation of the permissions dialog on Android and document that AndroidManifest needs to be updated. Additionally, iOS requires the app to provide a description text in info.plist to justify why it needs the user's location. There is much fragmentation when it comes to location :-/\r\n\r\nI want to work on trivial cases such as accelerometer and gyroscope first.",
