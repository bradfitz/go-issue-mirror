Whether the safety of\nchecking sanity is important though is a matter for the devs. As it stands (and if a\npanic is chosen as the solution) then code like the following becomes necessary:\n\nl := sizeCalculation(someParameter)\ntv := reflect.MakeSlice(v.Type(), l, l)\n\nwhich I feel is less readable than:\n\ntv := reflect.MakeSlice(v.Type(), sizeCalculation(someParameter), 0)\n\nPersonal opinions obviously.\u003c/pre\u003e",
