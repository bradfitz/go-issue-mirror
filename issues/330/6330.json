	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe code.google.com/p/go.text/encoding/charmap package contains variable pairs like:\n\nvar CodePage437 encoding.Encoding = \u0026amp;codePage437\nvar codePage437 = charmap{ /* a data table */ }\n\nencoding.Encoding is an interface, so that the CodePage437 variable currently requires a\nconvT2I call, in a package init function. (\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/6289\"\u003eissue #6289\u003c/a\u003e is possibly related, but even if\nthat was fixed, suppose for argument's sake that CodePage437 was initialized by a\nconstructed-at-runtime composite literal.)\n\nBecause CodePage437 is implicitly referenced by a package init function, the linker\nconsiders it used by any program that imports that package, even if it otherwise doesn't\nrefer to CodePage437. The linker thus can't drop the unused data table (and maybe other\nrelated metadata like pclntab??), and likewise for the N other encoding.Encoding\nimplementations in that package.\u003c/pre\u003e",
