If you change your program to http://play.golang.org/p/PxBAbmlIiU you get the same result in both cases:\r\n\r\n1.234 * 5 / 7 is the same as (1.234 * 5) / 7, where / is a floating-point division (resulting in a fractional value)\r\n\r\n5 / 7 * 1.234 is the same as (5 / 7) * 1.234, where / is an integer division (since 5, 7 are integer literals), resulting in 0.\r\n\r\nIf you make the 5 a float (5. or 5.0) you get the same results on both lines.\r\n\r\nWorking as intended.",
