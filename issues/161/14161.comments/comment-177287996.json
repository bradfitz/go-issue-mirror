	"body": "This addresses Konstantin numbers. \r\n\r\nFrom the narrative and the gctrace logs it looks like the program is using 40 HW threads (GOMAXPROCS=40) on a 40 core machine with a target heap size close to 4 - 5 MB at GOGC=100 up to 33MB for GOGC=800. This is on a machine with 160 GBs of RAM. The GC is doing a fine job keeping the heap size at the default minimum of 4 MB or, for GOGC=800, 33 MB. Throughput could be improved by allowing the application to use more of the available RAM. The increase from GOGC=100 to the GOGC=800 reveals how effective this strategy can be. The machine should have no problem supporting heaps many orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the default minimum heap size should be increased on machines with lots of cores and lots of RAM. For machines with \u003e 8 cores even 100 MB * GOMAXPROCS (# of HW threads) seems modest.\r\n",
