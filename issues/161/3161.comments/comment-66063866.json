That is, the\n32-bit and 64-bit systems will both reject 2**32 + 1 as an exponent.\n\nThe only thing left for this issue is whether we need to expand the RSA API to\naccommodate these giant keys in practice. It sounds like we do not, so I am updating the\nsummary and closing this as WorkingAsIntended. agl@, please speak up if you disagree.\n\nTo see if the sites were still using F5, I tried looking at the dnssec keys for .us\nusing the dig commands in comment #3, but I cannot just look at base64 output and tell\nwhat exponent is encoded.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
