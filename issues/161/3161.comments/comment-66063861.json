Since there was a big\nfuzz about weak keys, people added \"-e\"  to their dnssec scripts.\n\nsomeone at ISC changed the default from F0 to F4, but left the -e option in to mean \"the\nnext fermat prime\". \n\nPeople upgrade their bind, and get a double whammy......\n\nI see more zones based on F5. It is very common :(\n\nThe solution would be for \"-e\" to get ingnored in the next dnssec-keygen release, but\nthe damage is already done....\u003c/pre\u003e",
