In this case, large public exponents are both obscure and\ncrpytographically illiterate and so are exactly the sort of thing that we omit.\n\nIt looks like BIND's keygen utility makes it too easy to do something stupid and I'll\ntake that up with them.\n\nFor your needs, it's perfectly ok to write your own code to address corner cases. In\nthis case, since we have math/big, it's straightforward too.\u003c/pre\u003e",
