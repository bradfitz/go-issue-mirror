See e.g.\n\u003ca href=\"http://lldb.llvm.org/scripting.html\"\u003ehttp://lldb.llvm.org/scripting.html\u003c/a\u003e. Ideally, whatever we build will be usable with both\ngdb and lldb, and will continue to work as debugger support moves back and forth between\nexternal integration (gdb-runtime.py) and improved DWARF.\u003c/pre\u003e",
