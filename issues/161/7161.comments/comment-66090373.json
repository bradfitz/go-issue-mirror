Try\nrunning `debugger-test -v testdata/{simple,fail}.go`. The code is very quick and dirty,\nthough, and lldb support is yet to come, so don't look too closely. If you add more\ntests, or have any problems, let me know. Next steps, probably next week:\n\n* Add lldb support.\n* Clean up the code a bit.\n* Write docs for \"how to write a test\" and \"how it works\".\n* Add a few more actual tests, covering the new runtime-gdb fixes.\n* Get early feedback from golang-dev before polishing and building out any further.\u003c/pre\u003e",
