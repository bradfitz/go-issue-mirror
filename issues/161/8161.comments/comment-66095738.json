The devils lie in the\ndetails.\n\nunlike GOGCCFLAGS, which is hardcoded in cmd/go source code, C{C,XX}_FOR_TARGET\nare embedded during the make.bash process because they have to provided by\nthe user.\n\nEach run of make.bash can only build for one platform. Then how to manage the\naccumulation of embedded CC/CXX for different platforms. Up to now, Go builds\nwith make.bash doesn't depend on previous builds, and that is a good virtue to\nkeep. Perhaps we can let the user create their own configuration file for cmd/go.\n\nAdditionally, because the current state is that each Go toolchain can only be used\nfor a single cross-compiled platform. Just embedding two separate sets of CC/CXX\nfor the host and the target seems enough.\u003c/pre\u003e",
