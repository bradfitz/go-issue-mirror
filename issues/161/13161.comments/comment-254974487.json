	"body": "I looked into this for an hour or so. The mechanism does not seem quite robust enough still. After arranging for GOTRACEBACK=all to pass a SIGQUIT around like in GOTRACEBACK=crash, I only managed to find the missing goroutine running on another thread about half the time. I assume the other half of the time it had stopped by the time the SIGQUIT came in. We will probably need to be more aggressive about searching for the missing goroutines in order to be sure to print them all. And doing so will require cleaning up the SIGQUIT token passing a bit, so I'm not posting my code here. It was awful.\n\nTest program:\n\n\tpackage main\n\t\n\timport \"time\"\n\t\n\tfunc main() {\n\t\tfor i := 0; i \u003c 3; i++ {\n\t\t\tgo func() {\n\t\t\t\tselect {}\n\t\t\t}()\n\t\t}\n\t\tgo func() {\n\t\t\tfor {\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}()\n\t\ttime.Sleep(2 * time.Millisecond)\n\t\tpanic(1)\n\t}\n\nGoroutine 7 is the one that only shows up half the time.",
