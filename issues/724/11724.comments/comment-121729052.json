I might've missed that, but [the package docs](http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/xml/) don't seem to mention that. Might be a documentation issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, why can't that be changed to \"if no namespace is specified in the struct tag, it will match any namespace including the empty namespace *but excluding fields with the same name that explicitly specify their namespace*\" (or something better worded)? This doesn't seem like it would break anyone's code, because right now having `xml:\"foo,attr\"` and `xml:\"bar foo,attr\"` in the same struct results in an error.",
