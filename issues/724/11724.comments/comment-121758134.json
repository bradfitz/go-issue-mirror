Might be a documentation issue.\r\n\r\nYes - this could definitely do with better docs - please feel free to raise an issue.\r\n\r\n\u003e Also, why can't that be changed to \"if no namespace is specified in the struct tag, it will match any\r\n\u003e namespace including the empty namespace *but excluding fields with the same name that\r\n\u003e explicitly specify their namespace*\" (or something better worded)? This doesn't seem like it would\r\n\u003e break anyone's code, because right now having `xml:\"foo,attr\"` and `xml:\"bar foo,attr\"` in the same\r\n\u003e struct results in an error.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that would work very well. If I'm trying to unmarshal from an attribute\r\nin the empty namespace, I don't want any interference from other attributes that\r\nI never heard of before. For example in the code linked above, if the code just\r\nwants the `type` attribute and not any others such as `xsi:type` then there's\r\nno way to do that currently.\r\n\r\nThis is a particular problem because attributes are in the empty namespace by\r\ndefault, even if there's a default namespace set up (XML is weird).\r\n",
