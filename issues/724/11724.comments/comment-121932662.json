This is more explicit than a single space (which might as well break existing code), looks consistent with `xml:\"-\"`, and doesn't collide with anything since XML names [can't start with \"-\"](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-Name).\r\n\r\nStill, when there's a change to change the convention (e.g. 2.0), I'd suggest to make `xml:\"name\"` match only empty namespace, while something like `xml:\"* name\"` could be a wildcard to match any namespace.",
