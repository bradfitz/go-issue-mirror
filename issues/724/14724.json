To follow the circumstances with minimal maintenance cost, I'd like to propose having an internal package that provides routing message/socket parsers.\r\n\r\nExposed APIs:\r\n- ABI agnostic routing message/socket types\r\n- Routing message/socket parsers\r\n- Destination address prefix lookup for helping address selection in net.Dialer\r\n\r\nIt's also fine vendoring \"internal/x/golang.org/x/net/internal/route \" if possible.",
