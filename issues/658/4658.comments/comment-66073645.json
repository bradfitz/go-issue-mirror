However, setting the hostname to an IP\naddress isn't supported.\n\nSo I think this bug boils down to \"we should try parsing the hostname that the user\nasked us to verify as an IP address and fail immediately if it looks like one\". Do you\nagree?\n\nIf, in the future, we support IP addresses like that, we would need to be careful to\nmatch only against IP address SANs, but we don't currently support that at all.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
