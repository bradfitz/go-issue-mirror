	"body": "It might make sense to defer the creating/initialization of elements until a slice/re-slice brings the \"capacity objects\" into view/existance.\r\n\r\nAn often used pattern for an arrays is to create one with no objects and add objects to it until some condition is met (ie, dynamic/variable length array).  This is also true for strings (which as far as I know doesn't have a reserve capacity).  The implementation in go pretty makes one choose a capacity that on average doesn't initialize too many objects and one that doesn't make too many copies when extending.  Either that, or code up their own dynamic array.",
