If I was an\nexpert, I'd understand what codereview is doing in git terms, if I was a\nnovice I'd probably just use codereview, but at my level, I find it\nconfusing -- especially 'git mail' and especially when I was working with\nthat stack of 15 changes for shared library support.  Instead, well, I just\nuse git (git mail becomes \"git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master\" and\nsomehow I find that easier to understand).\n\n\u003e If this were added, it would be a pre-commit hook, so if you use the\n\u003e hooks, it'd be picked up.\n\u003e\nAh yes I still use the hooks (although given I have \"(add-hook\n'before-save-hook 'gofmt-before-save)\" in .emacs, all it does over the\nstandard gerrit hook is tell me I can't commit on master from time to time).\n",
