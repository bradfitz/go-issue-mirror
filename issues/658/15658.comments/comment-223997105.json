	"body": "@derekmarcotte, argh, I'm sorry. That wasn't a useful test. :( That eliminates the fork, the exec, *and* the finalizer, so there isn't really anything left. It needs to be something like:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc run(done chan struct{}) {\r\n\tcmd := exec.Command(\"/doesnotexist\")\r\n\tcmd.Start()\r\n\tcmd.Wait()\r\n\r\n\tdone \u003c- struct{}{}\r\n\treturn\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's important that the path be absolute. Otherwise, Go will try to resolve the path itself, fail at that point, and not do anything for the subsequent method calls. It's also important that the `cmd.Start()` still happen (even though it will fail). Again, without that, the Wait just returns nil immediately.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I didn't catch that earlier.",
