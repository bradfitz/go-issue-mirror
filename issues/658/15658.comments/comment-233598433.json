If you have more, by all means, set it higher.\r\n\r\nTry it a few times, and you'll see.  I just stuck it in a loop like `while true; do date; ./ex-from-comment-225006179; done`, and then you can see them over a day period.\r\n\r\nAnecdotally, I've been able to run a longer-lived process with `GOMAXPROCS=2`, but will be doing more thorough testing.\r\n\r\nMost of those dumps are from a jail running on bare metal.  The Xeon was straight on the jail host (although there were jails running).",
