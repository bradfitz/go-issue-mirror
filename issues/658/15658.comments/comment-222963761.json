	"body": "@aclements, Thanks for your suggestions.  I'm currently exploring a different option.  I was using gb for building my project (sorry! forgot to mention), and additionally for this test case.\r\n\r\nI certainly didn't expect wildly differing binaries in a project with no external dependencies, as gb uses the go compiler internally.  I've got more research to do here to account for this, so I apologize for that.\r\n\r\nI've built using go directly and am in the process of testing.  So far it has been running for 12 hours, without problem (with the SetFinalizers disabled).  I have had previous test runs last this long, so I'm not ready to call it a success just yet.  I'll be out of town for the next few days, so I can leave it running for a while and see where it ends up.\r\n\r\nI think this is a very promising lead, based on the objdump of the two artefacts.  It might be interesting to include in the Issue Report template, with the build tool ecosystem that is currently out there (or that there is an ecosystem at all).",
