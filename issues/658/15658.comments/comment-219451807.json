It's actually quite likely a race, but it's resulting in corruption of internal runtime structures, which suggests that the race is happening on freed memory. The \"workbuf is empty\" failure mode especially points at memory corruption, which is why my initial guess is that the finalizers (and the specials queue in general) may be victims rather than perpetrators. It's also easy to get finalizers out of the picture, while it's harder to get fork/exec out of the picture without completely changing the program. :)",
