Would you be interested in running 15658-doesnotexist.go to completion?  Should be on the order of 8-12 hours, maybe more?  If I could suggest pulling the command line from the bisect-15658, to get the environment a bit more hostile.  Check the logs directory for the bisect.\r\n\r\nIf there were a kernel problem, I would expect others to have problems with say, inetd (because it is a glorified fork/exec machine), in the wild.  This would be a pretty hot code path for many production FreeBSD uses.  Additionally, when looking at whether this is a kernel problem, the kernel data structures themselves would become corrupt (and panic like DragonFly), but I see no evidence of this.  My main testing machine has a current uptime of 105 days, with probably hundreds of runtime panics, yet no other services have faltered, and everything behaves flawlessly.",
