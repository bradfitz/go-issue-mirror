	"body": "I cannot seem to find much information on using go for a solution required to be compliant with FIPS 140-2.  Has any work been done on getting go's native crypto provider validated, and if not, is there any movement/interest in doing so?  If not, are there current recommendations for go adopters building solutions which have to comply with FIPS 140-2?\r\n\r\nIf there were to be interest in moving this forward, I'd love to see an API for putting the provider into FIPS mode, in which any unapproved algorithm (e.g.) would simply be disallowed/disabled/generate an error.\r\n\r\nIf this is something better proposed on golang-dev, let me know, and I'll close this issue and start a thread there.",
