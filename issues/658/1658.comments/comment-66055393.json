I tried to ignore the addend for these cases (explicitly\nzero it), but this just makes it always reference the first float value.\n\nAlso, the symnum of the relocation points to the __literal8 section and not a particular\nsymbol, so I'm guessing that the addend in this case should be the offset into the\n__literal8 section, somehow...\u003c/pre\u003e",
