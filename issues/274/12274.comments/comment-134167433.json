You wrote that \"So the best you can say in general is that P(X | Y) increases as n does.\". Is this true? I mean: maybe `4^-n` is not precise, but is it a valid bound? I'm reading the last part of the link you provided:\r\n\r\n\u003e In such cases, only the error bound of `4^âˆ’k` can be relied upon.\r\n\r\nI'm not a bayesian, but is there a way to express the statement `at least 4^n : 1 in favor of` in term of a [0..1] probability? Like in\r\n\r\n\u003e // If it returns true, x is prime with probability at least 1 - 1/4^n.",
