Leaving this up in case anyone else reading is unsure.\r\n\r\n\u003e Now I don't understand why did you remove the 4^(-n) figure (which is a provably correct bound on the probability of an error) and replaced it with a vague statement on the increasing of the confidence..\r\n\r\nSorry, I wasn't clear. The original statement states the bound incorrectly. My first suggestion replaced it with the correct statement of the bound.\r\n\r\nThe Wikipedia link explains this also, but it's easier to see with symbols. Let X be the event \"x is prime\", and Y be the event \"ProbablyPrime returns true\". The correct statement of the bound is this:\r\n\r\nP(not Y | not X) \u003e= 1 - 4^{-n}\r\n\r\nThe original comment is saying\r\n\r\nP(X | Y) = 1 - 4^{-n}\r\n\r\nwhich does not follow, even if you replace = with \u003e=. You need to use Bayes rule to compute that probability, which in general depends on the number x and the density of primes around it. So the best you can say in general is that P(X | Y) increases as n does.",
