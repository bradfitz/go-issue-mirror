It only show that I can't use simple (*ZZZ)(p).\n\nOne another example is to do a package analizer, concurency.\n\nThat is why it looklike: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/akrennmair/gopcap/blob/master/decode.go\"\u003ehttps://github.com/akrennmair/gopcap/blob/master/decode.go\u003c/a\u003e\nIPPACKET(ETHERNETHAEDER...(IPHEADER...(TCPHEADER...(HTMLHEADER...)))) is the only one\nleaf of the tree.\n\nIt can be so simple with __unaligned but here is a monster.\nConvert(not copy) from struct to []byte is not posible in place of alignment.\nI must reinvent the wheel or simply stay with c :( No.\nI know Golang struct mast be aligned in general. \nSo nice to have addon \"unaligned struct\" keyword :)\n_____________________________________________________________\nIs it unposible to implement it in \"experimental\" of Golang ?\nTell me the \"closest\" place in code where is it ?\u003c/pre\u003e",
