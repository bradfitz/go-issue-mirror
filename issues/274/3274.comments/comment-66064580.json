If you need to use an externally defined memory layout, and you want to\naccess it as a Go struct, then in some cases you need to write code to convert the data\nbetween the externally defined representation and the Go struct.\n\nSimply adding \"unaligned\" or \"packed\" to Go would address your specific issue but it\nwould not address the general case of the problem.\u003c/pre\u003e",
