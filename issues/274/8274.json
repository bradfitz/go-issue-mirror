	"body": "by **kyle.erf@10gen.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003ego version go1.3 darwin/amd64, built from source\ngo tools changeset 975:66877af85da7\n\nRunning `godoc -analysis=\u0026quot;pointer,type\u0026quot; -http=:6060`\n\nGodoc static analysis finds all of my packages, and completes processing without any\nerror messages. \n\nHowever, on certain source pages, all callgraph-related links appear twice in a row.\nThis is quite visually jarring, as you can see in the attached screenshot. Additionally,\nit appears as though some of the links contain different values for \u0026quot;callees\u0026quot;.\nNote that this does not appear on all package source pages, just some. I've attached raw\nhtml for one of the source files in the gzip package, as an example.\n\nPlease let me know of any additional tests or flags I can run on my end to help diagnose\nthis issue. As far as I know, there is nothing exceptional about my go setup. I'm happy\nto provide any information that doesn't involve leaking our proprietary code. This new\nfeature is awesome and I'd like to see it working properly :)\n\nThank you\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/8274/0/Screen%20Shot%202014-06-23%20at%204.26.35%20PM.png\"\u003eScreen Shot 2014-06-23 at 4.26.35 PM.png\u003c/a\u003e (134488 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/8274/0/broken_gzip.html\"\u003ebroken_gzip.html\u003c/a\u003e (142913 bytes)",
