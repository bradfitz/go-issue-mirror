Sorry but I don't know\nmuch about the organization and compilation flow of go sources :-(.\n\nIn the end what I pretended was to get a 386 windows binary without\nSSE2. I still have to test it. It runs in the modern box -- AMD\nFX-8320 8-core, -- where I compiled under Windows 7 - mingw - gcc\n4.6.2, -- but for that machine I have the offcial binaries, of course.\nThat's not the point.\u003c/pre\u003e",
