I suspect, your CPU is old and cannot execute SSE2 instructions that supplied\nbinaries have. These make programs run much faster, and most computers have them this\ndays. So, you are out of luck here - you cannot run pre-built binaries.\n\nBut, you can built Go yourself, if you like. The build process should be able to\ndetermine that your CPU does not support SSE2 instructions, and build everything\naccordingly.\n\nHere is \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/install/source\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/install/source\u003c/a\u003e general instruction. Please, tell us how\nyou went.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-windows**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
