Such as:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/gKPkO0JuUI\r\n\r\nor in the opposite direction, which might end up with a double slash, or some other variation of that.\r\n\r\nI don't know if that would happen in practice (e.g., maybe when switching levels?), but I was able to trigger a problem with a simple replace with something like a trailing slash on the command line:\r\n\r\n`%GOPATH%\\bin\\gomvpkg -from github.com/user/ -to github.com/new_top_level/newhello`\r\n\r\nwhich triggered similar error of:\r\n\r\ngomvpkg: invalid move destination: github.com/new_top_level/newhello; package or subpackage github.com/user already exists.\r\n\r\nBut that same example on the command line with the path.Clean() seemed to work...\r\n\r\nIn any event, thanks for the comment, and I guess I'll see if there are further comments about original intent or otherwise desired approach here.\r\n",
