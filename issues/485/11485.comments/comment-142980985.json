	"body": "I think I understand the synchronization (and lack of synchronization) involved here. I'm going to try moving this in to the concurrent phase. We can separately optimize it by reducing the loop to O(# of finalizers) or even O(# of non-trivial finalizers), but at the end of the day, we could still have a program with a legitimately large number of finalizers and I don't want STW to be proportional to that. Plus, it won't be a big time sink compared to other things in the concurrent phase, so this will shift the focus to other things that affect overall throughput more.",
