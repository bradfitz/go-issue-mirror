There are a variety of options that can be set in /etc/host.conf (influences /etc/hosts) /etc/gai.conf (influences getaddrinfo in general) as well as the usual /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/nsswitch.conf. In the mind of a sysadmin or a distro maintainer I really need a way to tell Go to use libc because it isn't practical for Go to reliably know when its behavior differs from libc.",
