	"body": "We should prefer the Go DNS resolver (over libc's) if the /etc/nsswitch.conf file permits, to avoid the cgo \u0026 thread overhead.\r\n\r\nInitial CL is https://go-review.googlesource.com/8945\r\n\r\nBut before I submit that, I want to gather a bunch of `/etc/nsswitch.conf` files from different systems for more test data.\r\n\r\nPlease post yours here if it's unique.\r\n\r\nPlease include the OS/distro/version information, and which interesting OS packages you might have installed (e.g. Avahi) or not. Whatever's interesting info.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
