This can be very confusing to Go newbies who are\ntrying to learn the API and figure it out from godoc.\n\nCombined with inability to do search for implementers of Listen or even a simple search\nfor \"func Listen\" on either the golang.org search box or the search on code.google.com,\ncan be very frustrating to newbies.\u003c/pre\u003e",
