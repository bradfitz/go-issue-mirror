I was expecting to see the top\nlevel function net.Dial  or net.Listen grouped together under the top level functions of\nthe net package. This might be my poor understanding of go code. \n\nI read some code that had net.Listen(\"unix\", filename) and I wanted to learn more about\nit, when I visited \u003ca href=\"http://weekly.golang.org/pkg/net/\"\u003ehttp://weekly.golang.org/pkg/net/\u003c/a\u003e and tried to look for it in the\nlist of top level functions, I could not find it. Maybe permanent newbies like me might\nget stumbled. I could not figure out that net.Listen was a constructor for Listener, now\nI know better.\u003c/pre\u003e",
