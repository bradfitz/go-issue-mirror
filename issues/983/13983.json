	"body": "While doing some benchmarking, I noticed that strings.IndexByte was slower than a simple index-based for loop. This was originally reported here:\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/Vjy_UUcugPE\r\n\r\nKeith observed that the benchmark ran faster when the string length was increased to 16 characters.\r\n\r\nFor a \u003c 16 character string, the results change dramatically:\r\n```\r\nBenchmarkGetHostIndexByte-8    \t100000000\t        23.3 ns/op\r\nBenchmarkGetHostIndexLoop-8    \t200000000\t         9.92 ns/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a 16 character string, the benchmarks are:\r\n```\r\nBenchmarkGetHostIndexByte-8    \t200000000\t         5.91 ns/op\r\nBenchmarkGetHostIndexLoop-8    \t200000000\t         9.17 ns/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeith mentioned that the `REP` instruction was most likely to blame.",
