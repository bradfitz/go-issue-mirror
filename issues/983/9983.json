	"body": "@griesemer wrote in #9966:\r\n\r\n\u003e I have long advocated a -ss mode (\"strong simplify\") which could do things like this (and more); and which wouldn't be restricted as much as \"-s\".\r\n\r\nOne thing -ss could do is remove the select from selects with only a single case (or default). Again, see #9966.\r\n\r\nThis issue is for discussion about whether gofmt should have a -ss flag and possibly also to collect ideas for what -ss might do over and above -s.\r\n",
