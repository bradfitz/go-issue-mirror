At least for git.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n@tamird  CL https://golang.org/cl/9815 is not the whole updating story at least for for git. Conversion between a sub-directory tree and submodule and back is not handled by this change. \r\n\r\nThose conversions are very error prone. People also keep forgetting to commit/refresh the git submodule reference while working with a repository containing submodules.\r\n\r\nI have even seen missing git submodule checkouts used as an advantage by putting an integration test-suite with full of ruby dependencies into a submodule and keep the go gettable sources small and neat that way.\r\n\r\n",
