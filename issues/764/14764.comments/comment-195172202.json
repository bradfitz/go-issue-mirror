BUT, if the command \"go get github.com/aa/bb\" fails, it will break the process of making. although i can use \"make -i init\", but as a programmer, it feels uncomfortable to see any exceptions.ðŸ˜‚\r\n\r\ni want to know or as a suggestion, if go can provide any callbacks of cmd/go tools, so we can register some events to do specified functions",
