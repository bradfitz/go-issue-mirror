I have working network code (a Redis driver) that is\nworking fine with weekly.2012-01-27 that now simply hangs on net reads (and writes are\napparently not sent to end point either) with RC 1.  Besides the minor sig change\nrequired by bufio.Writer nothing else is changed.   \n\nI back tested to weekly 02-22 and problem was also present -- haven't bothered to look\nback to an earlier post 01.27 release.\u003c/pre\u003e",
