Issue appears to be networking.   Started with update on existing\nweekly-2012-01-27; then zapped to fresh src install; and finally the .pkg binary. \nSource build tests clearly indicated net test fails.\n\nIs this a known problem? (noted nothing on\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/3208)\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/3208)\u003c/a\u003e\n\nLast working update on this machine/platform (for me) was weekly-2012-01-27.\u003c/pre\u003e",
