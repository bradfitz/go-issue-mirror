I suspect, the reasoning is that too\nmany false positives. Also we can't do much about them anyway. But I can see its effect\non windows - linux would remove the file regardless whether you are running it or not,\nbut windows is picky in that situation.\n\nI think, the best we could do here is warn you about the problem. Perhaps we could check\nos.Remove error for os.IsNotExist. We should skip the once that match os.IsNotExist, but\ndisplay the others.\n\nI am not certain, it will look. So leaving it for others to decide.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-windows**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
