	"body": "I think `C:` means `C:\\` in Windows system. If the base directory is `C:\\Go` then it must be written as filepath.Rel(\"C:\\\\Go\", \"C:\\\\Windows\").\r\n\r\nLike the example in filepath.Rel() that `filepath.Rel(\"/a\",\"/a/b/c\")` is `b/c`. I'll get the same result when I run it no matter where my current directory is. The \"/a\" means the current directory of \"/a\", that is \"/a/.\"(dot) or simply \"/a/\". Likewise, `C:` should means the current directory of `C:` drive, that should be \"C:\\\\.\"(dot) or simply \"C:\\\\\".\r\n\r\nThat said, the `basepath` in filepath.Rel() means the current folder(`path`) of the basepath. Rel() should add a Separator to the basepath if there is none.\r\n\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\n",
