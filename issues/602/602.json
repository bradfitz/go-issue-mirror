I don't \nunderstand exactly what happens, but I've provided an example here:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://pastebin.com/f76146b6a\"\u003ehttp://pastebin.com/f76146b6a\u003c/a\u003e\n\n(The Println at the bottom shows which if clauses are expected to be entered under this\nbug -- i.e., \nonly the first two.)\n\nThe error doesn't seem to be with the standard library, as the value 1, returned from a\nfunction, is \nfound to be neither greater than or less than 0, nor NaN -- but only if the call is\nevaluated directly \nin the condition. If assigned to a variable, it behaves once again as 1.\u003c/pre\u003e",
