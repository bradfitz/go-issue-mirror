Then, they're replaced according to the SQL\nengine.\n\nHere it's the function that I use to replace:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/kless/modsql/blob/7c86ebaca0a8bef8bba2afa2c6ec4c0f9e5e1b82/modsql.go#L75\"\u003ehttps://github.com/kless/modsql/blob/7c86ebaca0a8bef8bba2afa2c6ec4c0f9e5e1b82/modsql.go#L75\u003c/a\u003e\n\nand like example of statements, where I'm using:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/kless/modsql/blob/7c86ebaca0a8bef8bba2afa2c6ec4c0f9e5e1b82/testdata/model.go#L50\"\u003ehttps://github.com/kless/modsql/blob/7c86ebaca0a8bef8bba2afa2c6ec4c0f9e5e1b82/testdata/model.go#L50\u003c/a\u003e\n\n* * *\n\nThe function that I use to replace could be taken like idea to implement something\nsimilar in the standard library.\u003c/pre\u003e",
