I cannot reproduce the bug nor\nprovide any information about the environment in which this is happening. I only have\nindirect evidence that this is true.\n\nAlso, this seems like a real bug in Go itself too. Even if it is not indefinite,\ngoroutines are piling up for as long as the underlying call hangs, and that can happen\nfor several minutes as you point out. Not only that, but the logic that is in place\ntoday prevents follow up calls from proceeding until the previous call returns.\u003c/pre\u003e",
