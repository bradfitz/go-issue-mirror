It would be interesting to know which glibc version\nwas in use by the person who observed this bug.\n\nNote that that bug is about having a very large number of file descriptors open\nsimultaneously for DNS lookups.  The reported problem is a large number of goroutines\nwaiting to check a DNS timeout.  You can have the latter without the former.\u003c/pre\u003e",
