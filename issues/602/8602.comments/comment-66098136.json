But I admit that is complex with the use of singleflight.\n\nYou mention the documented cap of 30 seconds, but I think you are slightly misreading\nit.  That is the maximum length of time the resolver will wait for a specific name\nserver.  If that name server does not respond, the resolver will try another.  And then\nthere is a number of times that the resolve will query a name server, which is attempts\nin resolve.conf.  The default for attempts is 2 and the cap is 5.  So I think that if\nyou have three name servers in resolv.conf, the default time to wait is 3 * 5 (default\ntimeout) * 2 (default attempts) == 45 seconds, and the maximum time to wait is 3 * 30 *\n5 == 450 seconds.  Imposing our own deadline of 30 seconds in all cases would mean\nignoring the values set in resolv.conf in some cases.\n\nIn the original bug report the core problem appears to be that getaddrinfo is hanging\nindefinitely, despite the timeouts in resolv.conf.  That seems to be a bug in\ngetaddrinfo.  It's not obvious to me that using getaddrinfo_a will avoid that bug. \ngetaddrinfo_a is a more complex code path.  Do you know if anybody has tried to report\nthe real bug?\u003c/pre\u003e",
