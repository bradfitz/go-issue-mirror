	"body": "by **jdnurmi@qwe.cc**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhile the current 'hidden' flags to syscall.ProcAttr allow great flexibility when\nexecuting a child process, it would be nice if we could also control the 'Unshare'\nattributes of the child.\n\nI've attached a patch that works on Linux, but it will break all other *NIX builds (and\nthus I'd like some outside advice on how to best re-write this patch)\n\nUnshare is a Linux specific call, so I _think_ the right way to apply this (if others\ndesire it) would be an exec_linux.go fork of exec_unix.go;  The attached is just a\nstraight patch to exec_unix.go\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1954/0/unshare.patch\"\u003eunshare.patch\u003c/a\u003e (702 bytes)",
