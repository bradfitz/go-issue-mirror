Because so is my cron job.\n\nAnyway, my cron job (by virtue of using --mirror) does push tags.\nI checked by hand - they are all up to date on Github.\n\nThey appear here: https://github.com/golang/go/tags\n\nThey do not appear in the 'tags' tab of the 'branch' dropdown on the main golang/go page however. Maybe that page has a limit to the number of tags it will fetch, and it only grabs the oldest N. It also doesn't have things like release.r56. That seems like a Github problem, not our problem.",
