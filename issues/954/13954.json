	"body": "I was installing Go from source on a new clean Windows installation today and the installation broke because the default build behavior is CGO enabled whereas Windows doesn't come with a C compiler installed by default. This is not documented in the [installing from source](https://golang.org/doc/install/source) page.\r\n\r\nWhile the fix is pretty simple (either disable CGO via an environment flag or install a C compiler), this should be documented in the install from source doc. A known working compiler should also be recommended if we want CGO enabled like we used to earlier.\r\n\r\nI installed TDM-GCC as I seem to recall Go 1.4 build-steps used to recommend it and got a working installation but I also seem to recall Go used to recommend a different C compiler installation for windows in earlier days.",
