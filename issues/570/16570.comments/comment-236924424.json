	"body": "Go used to be written in C, so it could be built from source on a system that didn't have Go already on it. Starting with Go 1.5, this was changed; now Go is written in Go, and you need a Go installation to build Go from source. So if you want to build the latest version of Go entirely from source, you have two options:\r\n\r\n- build Go 1.4 from source in `$HOME/go1.4`, which only requires a C compiler (such as the Xcode command-line tools), or\r\n- install a Go binary package and use that as your bootstrap environment (this is what the `$GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP` variable is for)",
