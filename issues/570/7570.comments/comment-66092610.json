Do you want\nto propose a different behaviour?\n\nI am not good at expressing myself, so I will defer to your judgement re documentation.\n\nI'm rearranging os/exec to fix \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/7377\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/7377\u003c/a\u003e, and\nI'm worried about breaking things. So I value your input here. Thank you.\n\nI also asked that question because in\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/7570?c=1\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/7570?c=1\u003c/a\u003e Brad said \"Having the current\ndirectory in $PATH is a security problem. I see no desire to mimic that behavior in Go\n...\", but exec.Cmd{Path: \"date\"} actually looks inside your current directory (PATH or\nnot PATH). So, I though, perhaps there is some contradiction here. But I will take it as\nis.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
