It seems to me, it means different\nthings in different context.\n\ncmd := Command(\"./prog\")\ncmd.Dir = \"/tmp/d\"\n\n\".\" in ./prog means /tmp/d\n\nwhile \".\" in the PATH means \"my current directory\".\n\nI can live with that. But our current code\n\u003ca href=\"http://tip.golang.org/src/pkg/os/exec/exec.go#L115\"\u003ehttp://tip.golang.org/src/pkg/os/exec/exec.go#L115\u003c/a\u003e is not helping with my confusion.\nPerhaps it needs to be documented better too.\n\nI will see if I can implement all that on windows.\n\nThank you for your input.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
