	"body": "DotReader handles lines only ends with CRLF in document, but source code seems to handle ends with only LF too and I expected that behavior.  \r\n\r\nThis issue is one that DotReader can't determine end of data after empty line ends with LF not CRLF.  I confirmed that this issue still exists in current master ( 08ca401444cd3e08a98d7fd3f57e44b95243b4fb ).\r\n\r\nI am ready to send the patch to fix this issue.",
