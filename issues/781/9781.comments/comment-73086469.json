In particular, the sequence \"\u003cLF\u003e.\u003cLF\u003e\" (bare line\r\nfeeds, without carriage returns) MUST NOT be treated as equivalent to\r\n\u003cCRLF\u003e.\u003cCRLF\u003e as the end of mail data indication.\r\n```\r\n(From Section 4.1.1.4 DATA)\r\n\r\nI think that net/textproto follows this spec, isn't it?",
