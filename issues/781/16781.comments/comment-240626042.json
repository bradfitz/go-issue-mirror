Dup of #16775, #16720, #16680, #16112, etc.\r\n\r\nThe panic is caused by out-of-date .o files, and the fact that we have a new exporter. go install will fix it because it updates the .o files.\r\n\r\n/cc @griesemer (you should probably make a golang.org/s/ shortlink to a doc explaining this)\r\n",
