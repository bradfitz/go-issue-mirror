To get the PC of the\ncall instruction you have to back up one instruction. It suffices on all systems to back\nup one byte, provided you're not already at the start of the function (meaning something\nfunny is going on and there was no call instruction). This is partly why runtime.Caller\nreturns the file and line, so that ordinary uses don't need to do this computation.
