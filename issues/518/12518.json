	"body": "See https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-dev/oIB-wBj3ufw/discussion.\r\n\r\nThe language specification never mentioned binary exponent float representation, but it was previously included in the gc implementation and it is included as a formatting option via strconv.AppendFloat with the 'b' fmt argument. However, it now lives on as a parsing option only in the compiler and test code in strconv.\r\n\r\nThe capacity to represent exact float values in a clear human-readable way is valuable in numeric code, for example [here](https://github.com/gonum/lapack/blob/master/native/general.go#L78), where otherwise comments are required to explain the magic hex.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear how this should be included, since parsing a string is failable at runtime and these values are likely to nearly always be compile time constants.\r\n\r\n/cc @griesemer \r\n\r\n",
