Programs that care about _end are\nalmost always\ndoing it to make assumptions that Go violates.  For example, one common use of\n_end is to then use sbrk for memory allocation, and that could easily\nconflict with\nmemory that Go has already allocated.\n\nWhat library does this?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
