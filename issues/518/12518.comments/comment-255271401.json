	"body": "The fmt scan overflow to inf behavior for binary exponents is a bug. Note that decimal exponents are handled right: https://play.golang.org/p/SHc0zAdyhx. It's just one more corner case that makes this non-trivial. It would be fine to support 1.2p4 as fmt.Scan does. In fact that's probably important. But it adds more corner cases.\n\nI think we should probably postpone this to Go 1.9 since it's not urgent and there's little time left in Go 1.8. I'm interested to see this happen though.",
