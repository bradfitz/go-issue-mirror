	"body": "@kortschak FWIW, in Go we can express 1p-53 quite elegantly as the constant expression `1.0/(1\u003c\u003c53)`. All the various forms agree with the value computed from the bit pattern: http://play.golang.org/p/VjkVDA8PrL .\r\n\r\nOr more generally, any float constant of the form xxxp+exp or xxxp-exp can be expressed as xxx\u003c\u003cexp or xxx.0/(1\u003c\u003cexp) . Thus, the need for the p notation in code is diminished.",
