And I am often wrong, but ...\n\nThere are 2 scenarios here:\n1) network read completes successfully and returns 0 bytes read (EOF);\n2) network read completes with error (not sure about other OSes, but on Windows you\nmight get many different error messages depending on situation: who closed connection,\nhow, where and so on).\n\nThe main question here to Brad - do you care if connection is closed because of 1) or\n2)? Can you treat them in them similar fashion? If not, then why not? You then have to\ndecide what you are looking for in these error messages. If you just want to know\nwhether peer closed connection on you, I say you can't, because network will not provide\nthis level of details. Is user closed their browser? Is user turned their PC off? Is\nuser pulled their network cord out? Is ISP router turned off? Why should you care which?\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
