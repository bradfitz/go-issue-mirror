	"body": "Hi Russ,\r\n\r\nMy understanding of IPNet is that it represents an IP network. That was my intention of adding the type to net package and is the reason of existence.\r\n\r\nThe type can be used for conveying the information of IP network. For example, APIs surveying network interfaces in net package use the type to represent on-link address prefixes that designate connected networks and addresses on the node. The information is necessary for applications discovering and making some association between on-link neighbors.\r\n\r\nApplications using only global-scope addresses never suffer with the lack of Zone, but applications using link-local addresses may suffer. What if the returned list of IPNet from InterfaceAddrs contains a few address prefixes which are the same, such as \"fe80::1/64\". The applications need some information to distinguish IP links.\r\n\r\n\u003e Now it is really an IPNetZone but still called IPNet.\r\n\r\nInteresting, I've never thought that it would be confusing. My understanding is that IP of IPNet would be the entire address space, a functional address, or address blocks. Mask of IPNet helps to cut certain address blocks, and Zone of IPNet helps to identify the required link. IPNet just represents a network at IP layer not only for network-to-network communication but node-to-network (or node-to-node) communication.",
