Adding a zone gives you something conceptually different, because an interface name is only relevant to the machine that created it.\r\n\r\nWhatever change is made, a primary goal should be to be as unobtrusive as possible to the \"normal\" users; if people need to start adding `nil`s to their IP geolocation and spam filtering libraries, then it's a lost cause.\r\n\r\nMy inclination would be to make IPNet and IPNetZone distinct types, so that the type system can highlight the cases where a zone is actually relevant.",
