	"body": "Hi Mikio,\r\n\r\nCan you explain to me why this makes sense? The type is called IPNet and it used to be an IP address plus a network mask. Now it is really an IPNetZone but still called IPNet. This is confusing to me, and adding the field is going to break a TON of composite literals that assumed the thing called IPNet would only ever contain two fields: an IP and a net. That code shouldn't do that, but it will break nonetheless.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the main reason IPNet exists is to provide the Contains method, and of course the Zone has no bearing there. That's also confusing. \r\n\r\nIt looks like IPNet is being extended only because it was already in use in certain data structures. Maybe that use is the real mistake and this change should be reverted. I know we've already reverted this change once, in 2013 (#4501), but I still don't understand the rationale. Can you help me understand?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
