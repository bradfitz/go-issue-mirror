When using the iphone5 simulator \u0026 framework, I couldn't reproduce the first warning. Is the crash reproducible with iphone5? \r\n\r\nSince your build set up is different, I want to check if that's the build set up difference, or simulator vs. real device. It's a static framework, and xcode error message about dylib looks suspicious.\r\n\r\nBTW, the PIE warning didn't stop us from our Ivy app release. But our Ivy app release was done before we decide to let gomobile bind generate frameworks. :-( ",
