It looks like you're using the released version of Go 1.5, is that correct?\r\n\r\nI have a device here we can try it on (an armv7 iPad). I'll give it a go in the next couple of days. It looks like from your stack trace that the program is failing very early in the runtime initialization. However just to be sure, you may want to try compiling with -tags=lldb, which will enable a signal handler that may provide more information.",
