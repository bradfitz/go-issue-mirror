	"body": "Currently when the Transport of a ReverseProxy returns an error (such as from a bad upstream gateway) we return a `StatusInternalServerError` to the end user and close the client request [See reverse_proxy.go#L194](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/http/httputil/reverseproxy.go#L194-L199). It would be nice if this were easily customizable.\r\n\r\nOne option would be the let the developer specify an error handler function and handle the client connection themselves. This would also resolve #9864.\r\n\r\nSomething as simple as the following may be enough:\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/compare/0b5bcf53e...mdp:proxy_error\r\n\r\nIdeas? Another option would be to just have the developer write their own `Transport` and handle the error inside of that. \r\n",
