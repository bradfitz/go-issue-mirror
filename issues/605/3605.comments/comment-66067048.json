Can you\nexplain how to reproduce the problem, with actual code?\n\nI don't know what you mean by dependency.  Normally we mean an\nexplicit import statement, but if you have an import cycle your code\nshould not compile at all.  If you mean one goroutine waiting on\nanother, then you should have gotten tracebacks of the goroutines\nalong with the panic about the deadlock.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
