	"body": "Yeah, I mentioned this option at the end of opening issue. As you've shown, it's a trivial amount of code to implement without modifying ReverseProxy.\r\n\r\nMy arguments for:\r\n- Having the TransportErrorHandler makes it clear in the docs how to handle errors.\r\n- It's a fairly common use case to catch upstream errors and handle them with custom logic for downstream clients, so having a simple handler would make it clear to the developer that it's something they should probably handle.\r\n- It doesn't break existing implementations.\r\n\r\nBut like you've shown, it's easy to work around without any modification to ReverseProxy. I'm happy to close the issue if that's what's determined. Thanks\r\n",
