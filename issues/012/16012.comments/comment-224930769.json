The benchmark will keep ramping up the number of iterations until it finds the answer.  On your system, it seems that the answer is: more than the system can handle.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that you put a limit in your code on the number of simultaneous open connections.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue because at this point I don't see anything to be fixed in Go.",
