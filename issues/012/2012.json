	"body": "by **trevor.strohman**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003ehttp.ReverseProxy buffers writes (because\nof NewReadWriter in http/server.go).  This can break server-push\napplications where the client is expected to read pieces of the\nresponse as they arrive.\n\nCurrently ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP does this:\n  if res.Body != nil {\n    io.Copy(rw, res.Body)\n  }\nthe buffering is built into the rw.  To add flushing you'd need something like:\n  for {\n    nr, err := res.Body.Read(buf)\n    if err != nil { return err }\n    rw.Write(buf[0:nr])\n    rw.(http.Flusher).Flush()\n  }\n\nBrad remarks that buffering is usually good so this hurts the common case, and perhaps\nthis should be an parameter setting, or perhaps the Copy function itself could be a\nparameter.\u003c/pre\u003e",
