My output on localhost:4000 was \"404 page not found\" and I could not understand what was wrong. I check a posted solution, and mine was virtually identical. When I ran the the posted solution it too gave a 404. My friend told me that the first argument in the http.Handle function specified the path. No where was the pointed out when this was function was introduced (for the first time in this exercise). While I understand we're expected to look things up in the documentation, this is one of those times where you wouldn't know what's wrong and where to look. I recommend briefly clarifying how http.Handle works.",
