In fact, if you really do have a runaway stack,\nthe program will already crash.  CL 12541052 just changes the point at which it will\ncrash: changes it to a point where it is likely to tie up all your system resources.\n\nCreating more and more goroutines does not normally indicate a program error.  It\nindicates that your server is carrying a heavier load.  There is no clear point where\nthe runtime should say \"this program is in error and should crash.\"  Adding more\ngoroutines is unlikely to exhaust the program's resources.  It's other things that will\ndo that.  And simply limiting the number of goroutines won't let your server handle a\nheavy load any better.  Or so it seems to me.\u003c/pre\u003e",
