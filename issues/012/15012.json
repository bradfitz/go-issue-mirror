I had to hunt for the message, it's [coming from here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/2e90192b0e774f44a2d918509e0bd32823ce5c2c/src/cmd/link/internal/ld/objfile.go#L366). It was easy for me as an experienced developer to know that I should probably delete my `$GOPATH/pkg` directory, but others might not easily find where the error message is coming from and determine what to do.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I cannot provide the corrupted input, I cannot trivially determine which file is causing the problem and it is in private code. I will keep my corrupted pkg directory around for a few days in case anyone wants me to check anything, but otherwise I presume it is not useful.",
