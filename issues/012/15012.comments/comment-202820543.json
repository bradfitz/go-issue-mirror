I see that very few others have ever hit this message and reported it publicly.\r\n\r\nI also note that the code is littered with `Fatal` and `panic` calls with no other context, so it may be that the fixing \"this problem\" (corruption causing error messages with no further context) would require substantial work, and therefore may not be worth doing.",
