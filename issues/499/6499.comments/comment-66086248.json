The data processing is more dynamic\nand keys being accessed are user-supplied.  I used the scanner as part of evaluating an\nexpression to dig data out of, in some cases, large JSON objects.  The first version\n(Map above) was necessary using only encoding/json where I have to parse the entire\nthing into a map[string]interface{} and then traverse that structure to find the key I\nwanted.  The rest are how I do it with scanner.\n\nI also needed to do some streaming transforms of JSON for which I *almost* used the\nscanner I'd exposed, but since I was only doing simple substitution in strings, I used a\nmore simple state machine.\u003c/pre\u003e",
