I'm\nrunning OS/X 10.6.7. It seems likely that something changed in this release of Xcode. \n\nI also ran the AI_MASK test code:\n\nspark:golang$ cat test.c \n#include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;netdb.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;\n\nint main() {\n\tprintf(\"AI_MASK: %d\\n\", AI_MASK);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n\nspark:golang$ clang test.c -o test.o\nspark:golang$ ./test.o \nAI_MASK: 5127\n\nI don't have a sense for where to start troubleshooting, but I'd be happy to try any\nexperiments which would help diagnose the issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
