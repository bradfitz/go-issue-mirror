	"body": "I've spotted a minor issue with the comment formatting, I'd like to point it out.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/net/blob/5aa7325eaa14d7ed4b520f40d58adf2834c8de01/websocket/server.go#L99\r\n\r\nThere seems to be some problem with the comment content/formatting there.\r\n\r\n```Go\r\n//. that doesn't\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere should not be a period after the two forward slashes. But it also feels like some words are missing between \"you could use Server\" and \"that doesn't\", maybe? Maybe not. I'm not quite sure because I didn't write the comment, @ukai did.\r\n\r\nIt was introduced in https://codereview.appspot.com/8731044.",
