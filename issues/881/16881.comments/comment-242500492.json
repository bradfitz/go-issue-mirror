	"body": "The new export format does recognize old versions and does try to work gracefully around them.\r\n\r\nMany of the prior issues had to do with the transition from textual to binary format. The textual format had no versioning, and the binary format was in development, with people using mixes of the two, and sometimes even mixes of two different binary formats.\r\n\r\nThe \"gracefully working around issues\" was done only partially (in x/tools/gcimporter) as I (wrongly) assumed that people would always re-build when working at tip (we don't guarantee anything across different compilers). That's obviously not the case.\r\n\r\nThe trivial solution is to bail with an explicit error requesting recompiles - at least when working at tip. It's a bit more complicated than that because x/tools/gcimporter15 also needs to work on tip but also legacy installed packages.\r\n\r\nOn it.",
