Therefore ```gomobile``` does not work.\r\nI've tried to reinstall the command line tools from the DMG \"Command_Line_Tools_OS_X_10.10_for_Xcode_7_beta_5\" without any more success.\r\nMy understanding is that I have to wait for iOS 9 to be installed on my iPhone to enable a \"developper mode\". I am right ?",
