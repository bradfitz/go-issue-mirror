I've downloaded it and ran into the same problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gomobile build -target=ios golang.org/x/mobile/example/basic\r\ngomobile: xcrun xcodebuild -configuration Release -project /var/folders/tw/kgz4v2kn4n7d7ryg5k_z3dk40000gn/T/gomobile-work-121840117/main.xcodeproj failed: exit status 65\r\n=== BUILD TARGET main OF PROJECT main WITH CONFIGURATION Release ===\r\n\r\nCheck dependencies\r\nCode Sign error: No code signing identities found: No valid signing identities (i.e. certificate and private key pair) were found.\r\n\r\n** BUILD FAILED **\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following build commands failed:\r\n\tCheck dependencies\r\n(1 failure)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI went to Xcode, Preferences, Accounts, and added my Apple ID. Still same issue.\r\n\r\nThen I went to View Details and pressed Create action button next to \"iOS Development\" of signing identities:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1924134/9928875/e8fb9960-5cdd-11e5-85b7-3e8e1fa83a0e.png)\r\n\r\nAfter that, the error became different:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gomobile build -target=ios golang.org/x/mobile/example/basic\r\ngomobile: xcrun xcodebuild -configuration Release -project /var/folders/tw/kgz4v2kn4n7d7ryg5k_z3dk40000gn/T/gomobile-work-329279846/main.xcodeproj failed: exit status 65\r\n=== BUILD TARGET main OF PROJECT main WITH CONFIGURATION Release ===\r\n\r\nCheck dependencies\r\nCode Sign error: No provisioning profiles found: No nonâ€“expired provisioning profiles were found.\r\n\r\n** BUILD FAILED **\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following build commands failed:\r\n\tCheck dependencies\r\n(1 failure)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that even with Xcode 7, you still need a signing identity and provisioning profiles? Or am I missing/doing something wrong? Note, I haven't plugged in a physical iOS device yet; I was gonna try the .app bundle on simulator first.",
