GNU ld accomplishes\nthis by offsetting the read-exec segment to cover both the actual code sections and the\nPHDR.\n\nDoing this in a Go program is somewhat less elegant, because of how the linker's code is\nstructured. Instead, I opted to create a separate PT_LOAD segment that specifically\ncovers the PHDR.\n\nWith this change, elflint no longer complains, and tools like `paxctl` no longer crash\non Go ELF files. I'm currently setting up virtual environments to test this change on\nall flavors of linux (I lack other OS flavors), and will submit the patch once done.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Started**._",
