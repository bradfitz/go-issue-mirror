We\nshould be able to eliminate these, if we use runtime netpoll facility (just like linux\nand darwin do). There is quite a bit of room for memory management improvement in\nwindows net implementation. But it is not going to happen until after go1.1.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
