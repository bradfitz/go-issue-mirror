The simplest solution would be to have a test\nlibrary where gotest \nwill expect to find all the modules for which a test function exists (I believe gotest\nis working in a similar way \nright now). So the gotest could be simply:\na) extract the test functions\nb) generate the glue code to run the test functions\nc) compile and link the whole stuff with the a test library that will be created from a\ntarget provided by the \ndeveloper\nd) run the tests\n\nThe places to look for source files and libs could be given from command line options.\u003c/pre\u003e",
