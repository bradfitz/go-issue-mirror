	"body": "It appears that the `Marshal` function from `encoding/json` treats false booleans as if they were `nil` values, and thus it omits them from the resulted json. I believe this behavior is a bug. I couldn't find reference in the json spec, but it has caused some issues with my client code, that makes a distinction between a non-existent boolean and a false boolean. \r\n\r\nSee example here: http://play.golang.org/p/i3cNXqorif",
