So I realize this is not a bug, but it's also somewhat confusing and perhaps even unexpected. When writing `go` code, this isn't a big deal. But in the case of `JSON` data being passed from client to server (one of the largest use cases of `JSON`) , this makes `go` somewhat inconsistent with the rest of the world (clients and servers), and can confuse a lot of people. Not sure what a good solution would be. \r\n\r\n@spenczar that's a great idea, thanks. That's exactly what I was after. ",
