	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Download file 'go1.1.1.darwin-amd64.pkg' from this website\n2. Execute installer.\n3. Wait for the yellow ! sign and a message 'Installation failed' to be displayed to\nuser.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nGreen tick sign and message 'Installation succeeded'\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nyellow ! sign and a message 'Installation failed'\n\nNo further diagnostic debug messages are displayed, so I can't troubleshoot the issue.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nMac OS X 10.8.4\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nnone; trying to install go 1.1.1\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nAfter some investigation, it turns out that the last step in the postinstall script was\ncausing the failure:\ncp $GOROOT/misc/xcode/* $XCODE_MISC_DIR\n\nThe fact that $XCODE_MISC_DIR has a space seems to make the cp command fail (at least\nwhen being executed manually). However, that's not the only problem. This copy command\nis supposed to copy the content of /usr/local/go/misc/xcode/3 OR\n/usr/local/go/misc/xcode/4 but it currently fails because it tries to copy\n/usr/local/go/misc/xcode/* and the content of that directory are two sub-directories. \n\nIn the end, I changed the cp line in postinstall to the following (double quotes to\npreserve the space in XCODE_MISC_DIR):\ncp $GOROOT/misc/xcode/4/* \u0026quot;$XCODE_MISC_DIR\u0026quot;\n\nI then recreated the package and it installs successfully now.\u003c/pre\u003e",
