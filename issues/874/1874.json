	"body": "by **alexander.orlov@loxal.net**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIn template.html files you can embed CSS and JavaScript. Both languages are using curly\nbrackets.\n\nCSS example: \n\nstrong {\n color: red;\n}\n\nJavaScript example: \n\nfunction test() {\n//\n}\n\nTo be able to use CSS and JavaScript within a template.html file you have to override\nthe default settings, which might happen quite often as you'll often use embedded\nCSS/JavaScript within template.html â€” even just temporary to test something. So you\nhave to use the the SetDelimis func all the time to override the default.\n\nDjango's (Python) templating engine uses \u0026quot;{{\u0026quot; / \u0026quot;}}\u0026quot; as default\ndelimis. \n\nMy proposal is to use the same delimis as Django's templating engine.\n\nI could provide a patch to fix this issue if you're willing to accept it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
