If we want to be really precise we should\nlist those as possibly breaking backward compatibility for Go 1 source code.\n\nI don't think we should worry about the fact that future Unicode standards could change\nthe behaviour of Go 1 programs that use the unicode package.  I think that is an\nacceptable sort of package change, even though it will cause program behaviour to\nchange.  I don't think we need to mention this specifically.\u003c/pre\u003e",
