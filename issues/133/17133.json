	"body": "I was reviewing some code for performance issues, and the profile pointed me to a function that was accessing the same map element multiple times like this:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ndata[key].Foo = 1\r\ndata[key].Bar.Baz += 4\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe profile showed many calls to `runtime.mapaccess1_fast32`. I was wondering if it would be legal for the compiler to optimize this straight code to do only one map access, and then of course if it's worth doing it or not.",
