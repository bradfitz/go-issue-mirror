If the Go package has more than one file that import \"C\" and #include\nthat .h file, then we get this error from cgo.\n\nIn cgo terms, the problem is that the typedef has been given the Go name of the struct. \nSince the structs are untagged, they get Go names like _Ctype_struct___INDEX, where\nINDEX differs.  So we appears to have the same typedef referring to two different\nstructs.\u003c/pre\u003e",
