	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eNow that there is net.DialOpt() and net.LocalAddress(), it would be quite\nconvenient to have a net.ResolveAddr() function so that you can generically\ncreate the local address Addr that net.LocalAddress() wants. Right now\nyou have to write code that switches on the network type to call the\nappropriate Resolve\u0026lt;whatever\u0026gt;Addr() function; among other issues, this\nburns knowledge of what network types the net package supports into your\nown code.\n\nBasically all of the code necessary already exists in the internal\nnet resolveAddr() function; all that would be necessary would be\nexposing a public interface to it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
