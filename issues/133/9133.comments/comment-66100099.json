Neither GNU ld\nnor gold sort output sections alphabetically.  The suggested renaming may work\ncoincidentally because the external linker will first pick up non-Go start up files that\nhave both .data and .bss sections.  Future .data and .bss sections will be attached to\nthose.  Future writable/loadable sections not named .data will be placed after .data in\nthe order in which they are seen, and future writeable/empty sections not named .bss\nwill be placed after .bss in the order in which they are seen.\n\nThat said, please test your patch with both GNU ld and gold, as they use completely\ndifferent approaches to laying out output sections.\u003c/pre\u003e",
