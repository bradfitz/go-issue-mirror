	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIf one uses a package identifier without specifying an item in the package, the error\nreturned is \u0026quot;use of package foo not in selector\u0026quot;\n(\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/Q-KDAvp9mN)\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/Q-KDAvp9mN)\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI think the wording of this error message could be improved. It can be interpreted as\n\u0026quot;use of a package that is not in the selector\u0026quot; which makes it sound like the\npackage hasn't been imported (or something). A simple rewording to improve clarity could\nbe \u0026quot;use of package foo without selector\u0026quot;. This makes it clear the problem is\nwith how the package is being used, and not a problem with the package itself.\u003c/pre\u003e",
