	"body": "I think you shouldn't turn on -shadow by default in your plugin. That is the underlying motivation for this change, but -shadow just isn't reliable enough to depend on. It doesn't work well at all. That's why it's disabled.\r\n\r\nIf you really want it enabled always (which is a very bad idea), just have the plugin turn it on.\r\n\r\nWhether another experimental feature comes along, and what its properties, reliability, and safety might be are all unknown at this point, so planning for them in a way that others may depend on seems unwise.\r\n\r\nI vote against this proposal.\r\n",
