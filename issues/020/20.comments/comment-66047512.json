I'm running ubuntu 9.10 and all firewalls (iptables) are disabled (double \nchecked with iptables -L -n). \nlcgong's issue is \"connection reset by peer\" which should be related to the firewall. \nBut why \"unexpected EOF\" is related to firewall? I use firefox to get the URL, it works \nwell. So may be some issue in this test code.\u003c/pre\u003e",
