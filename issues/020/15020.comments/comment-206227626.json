	"body": "I added a reference to CodeReviewComments because Go programmers expect to see packages listed in a well defined order, and this order is not respected by godoc.\r\n\r\nHowever the real problem is that godoc package listing seems to be specialized for https://golang.org/pkg/.\r\nPackages are listed in a section named \"Standard library\".  The problem is that when godoc is executed on a local system, all installed packages are considered part of the standard library.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution is to add an additional section, that it is only visible when there are third-party packages installed on the system.",
