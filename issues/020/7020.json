The docs are quite vague.\nDo we want to support a use case when an application itself changes HTTP_PROXY at\nruntime? Then I think the app just need to specify the proxy programmatically rather\nthan changing HTTP_PROXY.\n\nI am asking because querying HTTP_PROXY accounts for 15% of memory allocations on\nend-to-end client/server http benchmark (10% of garbage generated).\n\nWindows syscall package reallocates the string several times and we query it twice.\u003c/pre\u003e",
