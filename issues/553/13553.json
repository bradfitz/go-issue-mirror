	"body": "This may be the same as #9976, but rather than being a problem in `go get` I think it might be a problem with go.googlesource.com.\r\n\r\nOn an AWS box running Ubuntu 14.04 I get intermittent failures running `go get` against various repos hosted on go.googlesource.com.  Git is version 1.9.1 and I've tried git compiled against both an OpenSSL-linked and GnuTLS-linked libcurl.  My estimation is that it happens about 5% of the time.\r\n\r\nIt never seems to happen against other servers (such as github.com) and I've never seen the error on my OS X box where I do the majority of my development.  It only seems to happen on our CI and deployment systems.\r\n\r\nWhen git is compiled against OpenSSL, the error is:\r\n\r\n    fatal: unable to access 'https://go.googlesource.com/oauth2/': Unknown SSL protocol error in connection to go.googlesource.com:443 \r\n\r\nAgainst GnuTLS, the error is:\r\n\r\n    fatal: unable to access 'https://go.googlesource.com/text/': gnutls_handshake() failed: A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.\r\n\r\nProblems with git and gnutls are [well documented](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnutls26/+bug/1111882) and I got fed up enough with the failures that I recompiled git to link against libcurl-openssl rather than libcurl-gnutls expecting that to fix the problem, but we see errors just as often as before, leading me to think it might be somehow server related.\r\n",
