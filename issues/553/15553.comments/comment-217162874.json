	"body": "This is working as expected.  `go run` builds the Go program and then runs it in a subprocess.  If you use the `kill` command on the `go run` process, you are just killing that process.  `go run` is a convenience command; it's not intended to do things like catch signals and pass them on to the child process.  Use `go build` or `go install` and run the process directly.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this as expected.  Please feel free to reopen if you disagree.",
