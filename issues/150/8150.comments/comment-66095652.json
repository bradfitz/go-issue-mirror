The former situation\napplies when the IV has no dynamic type because nothing has been assigned to the IV. The\nlater situation applies when the dynamic type of the IV is nil.\n\nThe static type of an IV is the type IV was declared to be:\n\n        var v1 interface{}\n        var v2 myInterface\n        var v3 int\n\nThe static type doesn't change exactly as the type of v3 never changes.\n\nEtc., ie. all (of the other) observations in the OP are already well defined in the\nlanguage specification.\n\n  [0]: \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/ref/spec#Interface_types\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/ref/spec#Interface_types\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
