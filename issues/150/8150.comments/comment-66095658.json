I'm happy to review any proposal and provide early feedback - just post\na link here if I can be of service.\n\nAlthough I agree that programmers seem to be getting by with the current level of\nexplanation of interface types, I don't feel there has yet been a sufficiently\ncompelling and precise explanation and, when there is, I think all Go programmers will\nbe considerably better off.\u003c/pre\u003e",
