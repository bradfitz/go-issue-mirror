Each such value's concrete type (== the\nvariable's dynamic type) \"implements\" the interface type of the variable. The variable\nvalue may also be nil, and in this case has no dynamic type because there's no concrete\nvalue in the variable (and I'm casually claiming that \"nil\" is not a concrete value). A\nvalue can never have interface type.\n\nBut let's not discuss this in this CL. There are already several issues open that ask\nfor the clarification of interface types, so eventually we will get to them. The CLs are\nthe place for the refinement.\n\nThis is also not urgent since all implementations agree on what is meant (even if it's\nnot written down clearly); and generally programmers seem to understand the intent.\u003c/pre\u003e",
