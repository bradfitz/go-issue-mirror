Microsoft recommendation (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms775147(v=vs.85).aspx) is to use something more specific (e.g. `application/go-error-message`). Other browsers are OK (they will respect `text/plain` and not interpret it as HTML).\r\n\r\n2. As Ian just said the main problem is plugins, on all browsers, as they ignore headers (`Content-Type`, `X-Content-Type-Options`), read the content, sniff, execute then can execute javascript (XSS).\r\n  - Adobe Reader (PDF) will execute a PDF if it's found anywhere in the page\r\n  - Adobe Flash (SWF) is a bit more restrictive, it'll only execute if the flash file is at the beginning. Often errors are prefixed with a program string (e.g. `error: %v`) in which case this attack would not work, but that's not a guarantee.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps so you can make a decision, let me know if you need more info.",
