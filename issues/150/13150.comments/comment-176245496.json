The ResponseWriter has the request inside of it, so we can cheat and interface assert it to the private `*http.response` type to get the Request. It's not super gross, almost no code, and at least it won't impact user code. It won't work for custom ResponseWriter types, but I think that's okay. http.Error is just a small helper utility.",
