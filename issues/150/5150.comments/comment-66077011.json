If I put\n/usr/bin/gcc (the one distributed by Apple) before it, all.bash passes. The version of\ngcc should not matter when I define the compiler to be clang. Ideally, I should be able\nto uninstall gcc and still comile Go with cgo support (I know that's not possible at the\nmoment).\n\nAnyway, I don't believe this should be a Go 1.1 issue - unless you want Go 1.1 to\nsupport gcc 4.8.0 for cgo builds, but that's another issue, this one is about clang\nsupport on cgo.\u003c/pre\u003e",
