Set CC = a version of\nGCC from home brew - \u003ca href=\"http://brew.sh\"\u003ehttp://brew.sh\u003c/a\u003e\n2. Launch the program with gdb for debugging\n\nWhat is the expected output?\ngdb loads the symbols from the file and is able to step through the file\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nFollowing output from GDB:\nGNU gdb (GDB) 7.6.2\nCopyright (C) 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later \u0026lt;\u003ca href=\"http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\u0026gt\"\u003ehttp://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\u0026gt\u003c/a\u003e;\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
