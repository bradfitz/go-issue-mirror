	"body": "We know that the argument to the function is a pointer, but passing a pointer is OK.  What we don't know is whether that pointer points to a pointer.  In the original example, it obviously does, because `i.payload` is a Go pointer.  But in general we don't know whether the `*C.either` points to memory that contains a Go pointer.  If it this happens to be the `DIRECT` case, we must avoid reporting a false positive if the `d.payload` field is an int that happens coincidentally to have the same value as a Go pointer.",
