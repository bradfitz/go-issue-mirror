I still don't see how handling a pointer-to-union is fundamentally any different than handling `void*`, which we already do for this case.\r\n\r\nI guess it might be different because the runtime assumes that it knows the structure of types other than unsafe.Pointer?  (Could we pass another parameter to runtime.cgoCheckPointer to say \"you may think you know what type this thing is but really you don't\"?)",
