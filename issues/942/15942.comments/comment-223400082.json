The `unsafe.Pointer` handling is problematic in general because it doesn't obey the restrictions on field/slice pointers and therefore produces false positives as in #14210.  But now I finally get it: if we pass a pointer to a C union, and if we can figure out that a C union might contain a pointer, then it would be reasonable to treat the union pointer as an `unsafe.Pointer`.\r\n\r\nI'll change the milestone to 1.8.",
