I see the following sections in the fmt documentation:\r\n\r\nFor compound operands such as slices and structs, the format applies to the elements of each operand, recursively, not to the operand as a whole. Thus %q will quote each element of a slice of strings, and %6.2f will control formatting for each element of a floating-point array.\r\n\r\nHowever, when printing a byte slice with a string-like verb (%s %q %x %X), it is treated identically to a string, as a single item.\r\n\r\nNot sure that's sufficient. Leaving for @robpike to comment.\r\n",
