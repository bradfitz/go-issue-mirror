(the arm port used to be\ndeveloped with qemu-arm, but then as the port is able\nto run on real hardwares, we no longer test on qemu-arm.)\n\nThe signal patch is originally intended for qemu-ppc64,\nbtw. I doubt that even qemu-ppc64 is able to run Go\nbinaries, other than the most trivial one.\n\nAs beefy arm boards are widely available, I don't think\nwe should invest into qemu usermode emulation any\nmore. It's slower than the more powerful arm boards,\nand it doesn't support multithreaded programs well.\n",
