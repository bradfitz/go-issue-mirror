This is inspired by Internet\r\n    RFC 3339 and is more consistent with numeric time zone\r\n    abbreviations already used elsewhere.  The change affects several\r\n    arctic and antarctic locations, e.g., America/Cambridge_Bay before\r\n    1920 and Antarctica/Troll before 2005.\r\n\r\n    Asia/Baku's 1992-09-27 transition from +04 (DST) to +04 (non-DST) was\r\n    at 03:00, not 23:00 the previous day.
