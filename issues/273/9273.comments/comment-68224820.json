That makes me lean away from\n\u003e them.\n\nWe can make the codereview tool always use the configuration file from the\nmaster\nbranch (or even the origin/master branch), so it's independent of which\nbranch the\nuser is in.\n\n(It seems this is how .gitattributes works, so there are precedent on\nalways using\nthe configuration from the master branch)",
