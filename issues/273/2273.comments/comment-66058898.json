The answer is not to do that,\nprecisely because it puts the caller in a weird\nstraightjacket where the type cannot be mentioned.\n\nYou are fighting the language.  Zero values happen.\nGood solutions include:\n (1) define Xer somewhere and make NewX return\n     Xer instead of *x (this is what hash/adler32 does).\n (2) document that the zero value is not valid\n     and maybe provide an Init method\n     (this is what tabwriter.Writer does).\n\nTaking away the caller's ability to speak about\nthe return type - which is what returning *x does -\nis not a good solution.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
