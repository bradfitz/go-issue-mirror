Instead the usual approach is to\ndocument the function that is returning the interface\nvalue.  So the adler32.New doc says not just that\nit returns a Hash32 but that it returns a Hash32\ncomputing the Adler-32 checksum.\n\nI just noticed that compress/zlib demonstrates\nboth choices: NewReader returns an io.ReadCloser\nand describes that the ReadCloser is a decompressing\nreader.  NewWriter returns a concrete *Writer, because\nit needed to add the non-standard Flush method and\nassociated documentation.  If you were to declare\n\n    var w zlib.Writer\n\nthen using w would crash.  That's okay.  We trust\nprogrammers either not to do that or to accept the\nconsequences.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
