(The part about using the working directory isn't in the docs or\nhelp for go test and someone on go-nuts told me to try it.)\n\nShould go test even be using the working directory?  I didn't know anything in the go\ntool chain used the working directory.  Does the go tool chain normally include the\nworking directory or is this a one-off?\u003c/pre\u003e",
