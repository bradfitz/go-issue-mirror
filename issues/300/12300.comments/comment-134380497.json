The 75-char limit is optional according to the RFC.\r\n2. Users can manually break words where they want.\r\n3. Popular services like Gmail do not respect this 75-char limit. \r\n\r\nThat is why the 75-char limit was not implemented.\r\nHowever if it is really causing bugs in email clients we could automatically break encoded-words when the charset is UTF-8 or when there is a space character for example.",
