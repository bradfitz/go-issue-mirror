For instance, when printing the imports, it sees the following\nfile name transitions (in the [] boxes):\n\nimport [-\u0026gt;/src/pkg/image/format.go](\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"image\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"os\"\n\n\t[/src/pkg/image/format.go-\u0026gt;/src/pkg/image/decode_example_test.go]// Package image/jpeg is not used explicitly in the code below,\n// but is imported for its initialization side-effect, which allows\n// image.Decode to understand JPEG formatted images. Uncomment these\n// two lines to also understand GIF and PNG images:\n// _ \"image/gif\"\n// _ \"image/png\"\n_ \"image/jpeg\"\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\n[/src/pkg/image/decode_example_test.go-\u0026gt;/src/pkg/image/format.go])\n\n(The \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; markers show increases/decreases of indentation).\n\nAt the moment, each time the file name changes in the position information, the printer\nassumes that the formatting state should be reset - basically it assumes that we are not\nbuilding ASTs that contain pieces of different files within a single declaration.\nHowever this is the case here.\n\nWhen the formatting state is reset, the indentation goes to zero; hence the\nmisalignment. In fact, before the end of the import declaration, the indentation goes to\n-1, and in debug mode (go/printer/printer.go:22 debug = true) we get a respective panic.\n\nThe offensive line is go/printer/printer.go:228 p.indent = 0. Commenting that line out\nwill resolve the issue.\nSee: \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/6849066\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/6849066\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/pre\u003e",
