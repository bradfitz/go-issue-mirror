The default hash isn't particularly good, which is why the constant\norder has that pattern.\n\nSo the 20 items in the map are one per bucket in the first 20 buckets.  There are 256\ntotal buckets.  So with probability (256-20)/256, the iterator starts at the item in\nbucket 0.  We do 80 tries, which works out to about 0.1% failure rate.\n\nI'll up the # of tries for now.  Long term, we should make the default hash better.  All\nthe non-x86 platforms use it.  I'll open a separate bug for that.\u003c/pre\u003e",
