After deleting them (`rm -r /home/akavel/gopath/pkg`), the problem disappeared. But I hoped `go build -i ./...` would give me the same effect as I'd expect from `go install ./...`, i.e. rebuild all go1.4 artifacts to go1.5, as I believe it's advertised w.r.t. go install (?), only difference being it would not install the executables (\"package main\"s). Is that not what should happen? I haven't tested `go install` before deleting the stuff, unfortunately; but I didn't want to pollute my bin dir with unwanted executables.",
