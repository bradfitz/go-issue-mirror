I've only tried it on 6g.\n\nBelow is a simple program that exhibits the issue. In this program, compiling with -N\nand -l causes the issue to crop up. I've seen the problem occur in more complex programs\ncompiled *only* with -N, but have yet to boil down an acceptably-simple repro.\n\n--- snip ---\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\ntype Foo struct {\n  X, Y int\n}\n\nfunc callMe(back func()) {\n  back()\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n  foo := Foo{42, 54}\n  callMe(func() {              // set a breakpoint here. \"info locals\" will show foo as \"\u0026foo = NNNN\"\n    fmt.Printf(\"%v\", foo)\n  })\n}\u003c/pre\u003e",
