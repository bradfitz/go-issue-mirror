	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCurrently the spec says:\n\n\u0026quot;If the capacity of s is not large enough to fit the additional values, append\nallocates a new, sufficiently large slice that fits both the existing slice elements and\nthe additional values. Thus, the returned slice may refer to a different underlying\narray.\u0026quot;\n\nAs far as I can tell, the spec does not currently prohibit append from allocating a new\nslice when the capacity is sufficiently large. This should be prohibited (if that is the\nintent), or clarified that it as a possible behavior if that is okay.\n\nSee accompanying discussion \n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#\u003c/a\u003e!topic/golang-nuts/o5rFNqd0VjA\u003c/pre\u003e",
