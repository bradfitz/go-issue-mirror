Every step we take in that direction makes cross-compilation harder.\n\nThe main thing that needs to be done is that the linker needs to be made clearer about the difference between virtual alignment requirements and file offset alignment requirements. That is, the systems with 64 kB pages do not require the file data mapped into those pages to be 64 kB aligned within the file. They only require something smaller, probably 4 kB. With that distinction made, we can adjust the virtual address alignment upward without affecting binary size. We should do that.\n\nChanging _PhysPageSize in the runtime and syscall.Getpagesize are both trivial, especially in comparison.\n\nBut it's now too late to be doing any of this for Go 1.5.",
