You can not allocate memory.  You can not start a goroutine.  You can call almost none of the functions in the syscall package.  Instead our procedure has been that for things that have to happen between clone and exec in the child, we add entries to syscall.SysProcAttr.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this, but please feel free to reopen if you meant something else.  An example would help.",
