	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eFrom golang-dev:\n\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\nMatthew Endsley:\n\nI was testing the go1.3rc1 release on our codebase and found it failed one of our test\ncases involving http responses.\n\nIt appears that in some cases, http.Response.Write will emit 2 Content-Length headers. A\nshort example the reproduces the behavior can be found here:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/qsH1MeVSHu\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/qsH1MeVSHu\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIn go 1.2 this generated the following output:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Length: 0\n\nIn go1.3rc1 I'm getting the following:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Length: 0\nContent-Length: 0\n\nFor reference, on current tip (087e446f2c41) I see the same output as go1.3rc1\n\nAs a side note, this issue only occurs if response.Request.Method is \u0026quot;POST\u0026quot;.\nIf the request method is \u0026quot;GET\u0026quot; the duplicate Content-Length is not emitted.\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n\n\n\nThe problem was introduced in revision b2ebbbcfc615 for fixing \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/5381\"\u003eissue #5381\u003c/a\u003e. The net/http\nServer doesn't use this code, but it is a regression from 1.2.  In the earlier fix, I\ndidn't take care of the case where PUT/POST were special-cased in transfer.go ages ago\nin revision 4d792b5bea35 for HTTP Requests, but the transfer code deals with both\nRequests and Responses, so a Content-Length of length 0 was always being sent for\nResponses too.  That code deserves a second look in Go 1.4, but will fix minimally for\nnow.\u003c/pre\u003e",
