	"body": "@ianlancetaylor: The OS X sigaction(2) [man page](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man2/sigaction.2.html) says this:\r\n\r\n\u003e Restart of pending calls is requested by setting the SA_RESTART bit in\r\n\u003e sa_flags. The affected system calls include open(2), read(2), write(2),\r\n\u003e sendto(2), recvfrom(2), sendmsg(2) and recvmsg(2) on a communications channel\r\n\u003e or a slow device (such as a terminal, but not a regular file) and during a\r\n\u003e wait(2) or ioctl(2).\r\n\r\nThe sentence structure is ambiguous, but I read that as saying that open(2) is not guaranteed to be restarted for regular files. Note that the [Linux man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html) also unambiguously says that open(2) is only restarted when \"it can block\". Technically that is true of fuse files, but it is not true of regular files in general and so I wouldn't be too surprised if it didn't restart for any regular file.\r\n\r\n@davecheney: I can't reproduce it on Linux with my minimized test case. The larger program where I found this issue deadlocks on Linux due to issue #11155, so I'm not sure about that one.",
