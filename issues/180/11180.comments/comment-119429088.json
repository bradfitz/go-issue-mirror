	"body": "EINTR, EAGAIN and EBUSY are special cases in POSIX, interestingly defined vaguely and implemented vaguely from filesystem to filesystems, and of course operating systems to operating systems. \r\n\r\nOSXFUSE sending EINTR is perfect in accordance with POSIX, it is the client application which is layered on top of OSXFUSE perhaps your own filesystem built out of OSXFUSE which could potentially handle this at POSIX level and perhaps even want to make sense of it - for simple example https://github.com/bazil/fuse/blob/master/fuse.go#L522\r\n\r\nThere are other good examples too, GlusterFS which is built on top of FUSE for example handles EINTR perfectly fine for all network operations, sockets, polling etc. \r\n\r\nWhile writing this i stumbled upon python PEP 0475 - they thought convenient API's on top of regular syscall's  should be python's responsibility - for example here http://bugs.python.org/issue23285, https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0475/ - so python3.5 handles this automatically. \r\n\r\nPotentially it can be handled gracefully to remove some burden perhaps of switch casing through os.PathError* - but given a choice personally as a user of os.OpenFile(), i would prefer it returns the EINTR up the chain and let me handle it.\r\n\r\nCan be debated further .... :-) ",
