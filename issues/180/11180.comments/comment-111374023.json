	"body": "If a signal is installed with SA_RESTART, as is always true of signals installed by the Go runtime, then only a limited set of calls should ever return EINTR.  On a GNU/Linux system the complete set can be found in signal(7).  I don't know about Darwin.  open is not on the list for GNU/Linux.  Can you find the list for Darwin?  On GNU/Linux it would be a clear bug if open ever returns EINTR for a signal whose handler is installed with SA_RESTART.\r\n\r\nWe do not want to sprinkle EINTR loops through the os and net packages unless they are documented as being required.  I think we would prefer not to change the core Go libraries to work around bugs in FUSE.",
