On a GNU/Linux system the complete set can be found in\n\u003e signal(7). I don't know about Darwin. open is not on the list for\n\u003e GNU/Linux. Can you find the list for Darwin? On GNU/Linux it would be a\n\u003e clear bug if open ever returns EINTR for a signal whose handler is\n\u003e installed with SA_RESTART.\n\u003e\n\u003e We do not want to sprinkle EINTR loops through the os and net packages\n\u003e unless they are documented as being required. I think we would prefer not\n\u003e to change the core Go libraries to work around bugs in FUSE.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/11180#issuecomment-111374023\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
