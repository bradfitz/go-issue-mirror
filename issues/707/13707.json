	"body": "So I found this issue when switching to 1.6 from 1.5.2. The issue is when i try to get some data from my AWS bucket. I am using github.com/mitchellh/goamz/aws and github.com/mitchellh/goamz/s3 to get the data. What happens is that if i call the method \"Get\"  in a go-routine the request will not go through, but if I do not put the call in a go-routine it will work just fine.",
