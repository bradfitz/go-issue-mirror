See example use case in mholt/caddy#829.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the same can be said about NextProtos (already a desired feature, to have HTTP/2 enabled only on some hosts, mholt/caddy#189), CipherSuites, SessionTicketKey, ClientSessionCache, CurvePreferences...\r\n\r\nI suspect some of them have issues open about them already, but couldn't find them.",
