Strings also seem to have more well-defined content: you\nalways know that a string (should) contain printable characters that are meaningful when\nprinted. Converting from a []byte to a string is less common and useful, if you wanted a\nstring then you would have allocated a string in the first place. []bytes can also\ncontain arbirary content, and often do, so implicity converting them to a string is\nsomething you should probably think twice about.\n\nWorth noting is that if this is often an issue for users of your API, you can simply\nprovide a String() method on the named type, circumventing the issue entirely.\u003c/pre\u003e",
