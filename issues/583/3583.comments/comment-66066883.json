But sometimes it happens to be in your\n\"current\" directory. The way Windows finds executables to run, it looks in the current\ndirectory first, then it searches every directory listed in PATH environment variable in\nturn. Your PATH is quite long, but the only one that looks like Go related is C:\\Go\\bin\nin the very end. Please, run\n\ndir C:\\Go\\bin\\\n\nto see if go.exe is in there. Also, if you run this:\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"os/exec\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\texe, err := exec.LookPath(\"go\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tfmt.Printf(\"go program lives in %s\\n\", exe)\n}\n\nit should tell you where your go.exe lives.\n\nIf you have go.exe in C:\\Go\\bin\\, then you should be able to run it from there, like this\n\ncd c:\\go\\bin\n.\\go.exe\n\nTry it from command line see if that works.\n\nPerhaps, your c:\\go\\bin\\go.exe is corrupted or something, and you are actually running\ngo.exe from some other directory. But when you are in c:\\go\\bin then go.exe there has to\nbe tried first, and it fails. Try my little program above and run it from different\nplaces and see what it does.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
