Please show us output of all\nthese commands:\n\ndir C:\\Go\\src\\pkg\\code.google.com\\p\\go-tour\\gotour\ndir C:\\Go\\bin\\gotour.exe\necho %PATH%\n\nThank you.\n\nThere are many problems you are seeing. It seems, gotour sometimes can't find go.exe to\nbe able to compile code samples from web browser. We do not know why yet, but if you\nanswer my request, I might make some suggestions.\n\nYou do not see error message, because gotour.exe does not show it to you (as you have\ndiscovered). It is not correct behavior, so I have asked to change gotour\n(\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/6201066/)\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/6201066/)\u003c/a\u003e. Hopefully, if my change is accepted, you will\nbe able to see your error message properly.\n\nNext problem is the error message: \".\\go.exe: error 2 (Format Message failed with\nerr=15100)\". My message now says \"exec: \"go\": executable file not found in %PATH%\". So,\nI wonder, why yours is different. Also, it seems syscall.FormatMessage winapi function\nfailed to fetch English error message for your error #2 (ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND). That is\nanother mystery to investigate. But one thing at a time. :-)\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
