It shaved about .5Mb from the resulting unminified JS (1.5Mb-\u003e961k), which was a bit over 33%. So, while the premium of 9% in pure-Go might seem mild, for GopherJS it's a huge difference.\r\n\r\n*Addendum;* these successful reductions also came from removing `fmt` from another upstream tool; took me a while to hunt it down in that dependency and I [ended up pulling it into my tree](https://github.com/cathalgarvey/go-freeboard/blob/master/jsWrap.go). After removing `net/http` from my GopherJS code, which removed ~1.5Mb, the biggest reduction has been the 0.5Mb reduction from removing `fmt`. It matters, this can be the difference between using Go and simply using straight JS!)",
