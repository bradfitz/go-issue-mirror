	"body": "What I objected to with -- in the past was the idea that you'd put more flags after it. The long-established definition of -- is that it _stops_ flag processing, even (especially!) when what comes next look like more flags. There's also a compatibility issue. From the beginning, -- has been passed through to the underlying binary, so that it had the same meaning in the underlying test binary command line as it did in the go test command line. There may well be tests that expect that.\r\n\r\nThe same compatibility issue could arise with -args, but -args is not a long-established convention being given a different meaning, so it's less likely that a test already expects it and also less problematic to give it the meaning we need.",
