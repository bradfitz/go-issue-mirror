We've worked pretty hard\n(and, I would argue, successfully) so that users don't think about that:\nthey see a single thing, even though underneath there are two different\nprograms implementing that thing. It would be strange for --, which means\n\"the rest of the command-line is _not_ flags\" to mean that only for 1/2 of\nthe pieces.\n",
