	"body": "A more common place you'd see -- is in something like `ls -l -- -n` as an\nalternative to `ls -l ./-n`.\n\nThe sh example is at the very least convoluted. I can't think of any other\nexamples where -- means \"the rest of the command line is not interpreted as\nflags by the top-level command\". Most people don't know sh -c CMD takes\nadditional arguments at all, and what it does with them is inconsistent,\nand sh -c is explicitly about reexecution in a direct way that I would\nargue 'go test' is not.\n\nAlso, fun on my Mac:\n\n```\n$ sh -c 'echo $*' -- -n a b c\n-n a b c\n$ sh -c '/bin/echo $*' -- -n a b c\na b c$\n$\n```\n\nAgain maybe not the best example. :-)\n\nAlso, for the record, the way git uses -- (to separate one kind of non-flag\nargument from another) is non-standard too.\n",
