The go test command treats flag arguments as if they were package\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThis no longer works (note: all our code uses Gustavo's gocheck package\r\nwhich adds its own flags to the test):\r\n\r\n    go test -gocheck.f MyTest\r\n\r\nInstead, one is required to write:\r\n\r\n    go test -gocheck.f=MyTest\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    go test . -gocheck.f MyTest\r\n\r\n",
