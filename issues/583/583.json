	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCurrently when global variable initializers and init functions use a go \nstatement, the goroutine is queued up to run when main.main starts.  This \nmeans that some natural patterns fail to work, such as using a for statement \nwith a range clause over a vector.  It means that for any initializer you \nhave to know whether the initializer uses a goroutine or not.\n\nWe should revisit this decision to see whether it can reasonably be relaxed.  \nMailing list discussion at \u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/golang-\"\u003ehttp://groups.google.com/group/golang-\u003c/a\u003e\nnuts/browse_thread/thread/df0cb121ee3d8504/da8dec4bc9bff4d8 .\u003c/pre\u003e",
