	"body": "I've done something like this in u-root. My approach needs work, but I'm pretty sure you could build on it and get where you want to be without changing the toolchain. I've got a tool called bb that rewrites programs into packages, adjusts the names of the args, and so on, and builds them all into the u-root shell. It may not be enough to do what you want, however. I am using it today in initramfs embedded in bios flash with a kernel. \r\ngithub.com/rminnich/u-root/src/bb/...\r\n\r\nI wish it were a bit cleaner to do what I'm doing but I'm not sure you really want to change the go toolchain. I welcome suggestions on the code btw.",
