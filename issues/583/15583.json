	"body": "Would there be interest in a PR that removes `fmt` as a dependency in `encoding/json`, if doing so didn't overly complicate the code?\r\n\r\nI ask because `fmt` is a large dependency to pull in for what appears to be exclusively error formatting in `decode.go`.\r\n\r\nHappy to contribute this.",
