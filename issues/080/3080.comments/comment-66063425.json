I measured that the compiler\n(8g) is allocating many instances of struct Node. I created a new struct FuncNode and\nhave put there some of the fields which were in struct Node. This lowered the memory\nconsumption when compiling the godoc package by approximately 10% (from 110MB to 100MB).\n\nI am unsure whether to continue work on this because the C code manipulating the fields\nin struct Node is hard to understand, and in consequence of this it is hard for me to\nverify whether the new code is correct.\n\nWould somebody be interested in taking a look at the new code? That is, provided that\nthere is agreement that lowering the memory consumption in this way is a valid goal.\u003c/pre\u003e",
