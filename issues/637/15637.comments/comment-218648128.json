So when adding windows, we had to define all unix constants like EINTR and EMFILE, because os package used to use them. Otherwise os package wouldn't build.\r\n\r\nBut Windows syscalls do not really return EINTR or EMFILE or ECONNRESET or ECONNABORTED.\r\n\r\nWhen time came to implement net package, windows version was very much separate code. So net package does not use ECONNRESET or ECONNABORTED.\r\n\r\nI just checked our current source:\r\n```\r\n# cd $GOROOT\r\n# grep syscall.ECONNRESET * -r\r\n# grep syscall.ECONNABORTED * -r\r\nsrc/net/fd_unix.go:                     case syscall.ECONNABORTED:\r\nsrc/net/error_unix_test.go:     abortedConnRequestErrors = []error{syscall.ECONNABORTED} // see accept in fd_unix.go\r\n#\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo windows code uses ECONNRESET or ECONNABORTED.\r\n\r\nAlex",
