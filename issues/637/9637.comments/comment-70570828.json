This can be useful if the source is a local fork\r\nof the original. **Also, it enables insecure protocols when fetching packages.**\r\n\r\nThe point of a separate flag with clear meaningful name is to point out insecurity (or rather, make it scream). Similar to `InsecureSkipVerify` in crypto/tls package, not just `Force` or `SkipVerify` , or `hg push --insecure` in Mercurial, or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React.js.\r\n\r\nAgreed on announcement before release.",
