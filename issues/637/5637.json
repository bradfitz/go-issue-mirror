This would not be markup as such, but\nwould be ways to organize the presented docs.  For example, a way to indicate which\nnames in a package are important and which are not.  The important names would appear\nfirst.  The unimportant ones would be hidden by default.\n\n* When the text has a capitalized word that is the same as an exported name in the\npackage, link the text to the docs for that name.\n\n* Provide some way to automatically know which types implement which interfaces, ideally\nacross packages.\u003c/pre\u003e",
