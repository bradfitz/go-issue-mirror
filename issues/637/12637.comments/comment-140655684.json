But the race detector can only detect the\r\nrace if it actually happens, so you need to run the program\r\nmultiple times with various inputs and work loads. (And note\r\nthat while the race detector can show races, it can never prove\r\nthat the code is free of any data races.)\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
