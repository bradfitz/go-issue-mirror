Relaxing interface equality will cause the switch to take the wrong branch, and the program (which previously worked) will fail when that branch tries to type-switch to unpack the variant parameter.\r\n\r\nA toy example: https://play.golang.org/p/Lrql97NtI6\r\nIt currently runs successfully, but with the proposed change would panic.\r\n\r\nIt may be that no such programs exist in practice, but I don't think it's correct to claim that the proposed change is strictly backward-compatible in theory.",
