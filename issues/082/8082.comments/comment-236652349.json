You can only usefully switch on interfaces if there is some method in the first interface that isn't in the second.  For the \"variant types as bounded interfaces\" use-case, you need to either deal exclusively with concrete types or accept that constraint on the interface types.\r\n\r\nThe same workaround - adding a possibly-unexported method to the first interface - works regardless of this proposal.\r\n",
