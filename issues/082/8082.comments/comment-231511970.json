But as well…\r\n\r\n\u003e The exact error values that represent distinct run-time error conditions are unspecified.\r\n\r\nThus, there is no possible correct code that can depend upon a type assert and only a type assert throwing a panic. Any deferred function recovering run-time panics must by necessity handle _all_ possible run-time panics. (like instead of let's say nil-pointer dereference)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, they are—by necessity—depending upon unspecified behavior.",
