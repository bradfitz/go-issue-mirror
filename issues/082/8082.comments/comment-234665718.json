I'd appreciate if you reflected on your approach and going forward presented your arguments in a more constructive manner.\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I've never said we can't address this issue *in some way* for Go 1.  That's not even my decision.  I've only clarified that the code samples presented are valid Go 1.\r\n\r\nI've also not ruled out the possibility of finding some other solution to gRPC's use of x/net's Context.  E.g., the type alias proposal (#16339) would be a generic solution to that.  I can envision other non-generic proposals if it becomes really problematic; e.g., maybe the compiler could treat \"golang.org/x/net/context\" as a *path* alias for \"context\".\r\n\r\nLastly, like @cespare points out, backwards compatibility for gRPC is technically outside the Go 1 compat guarantee (though that doesn't mean we should cavalierly ignore the problem either).",
