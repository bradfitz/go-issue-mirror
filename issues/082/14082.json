	"body": "I use this [go-embed](https://github.com/pyros2097/go-embed) tool for embedding resources into my executable directly. It produces a file like this https://github.com/pyros2097/go-embed/blob/master/examples/assets/main_prod.go.\r\n\r\nBut When I use this to build my frontend images which approximates to 20MB into a single main.go file which is also 20MB but is 300K+ lines of code It takes forever to compile and then crashes my CPU. I guess this is a problem because I have only 4GB of memory and an core i3 processor.\r\nBut it seems to compile properly on my friends 16GB laptop core i7.\r\n\r\nIs there anyway I can make it compile on my laptop? Maybe by splitting the single file into many files or something?\r\n\r\nMy GoENV and go version go1.5.2 linux/amd64\r\n```\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/home/pyros2097/Code\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/usr/lib/go\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/usr/lib/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64\"\r\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\"1\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n```",
