Products like the Arietta G25 from ACME systems (which I use) will become incompatible with future versions of the GO ARM runtime if what I'm reading here is correct.\r\n\r\nWhile I generally agree with what is proposed here for GO 1.8, is there no way for a developer to re-introduce a V5-compatible runtime into his/her own GO development environment?\r\n\r\nIf the architecture requirement gets bumped to ARMv6 or 6K, how long will that be good for?\r\n\r\n-Pete\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
