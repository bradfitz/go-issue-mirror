I took a quick look through all of the 64-bit atomic operations and we're pretty careful to amortize the cost of almost all of them. It might worth turning `gcController.dedicatedMarkWorkersNeeded` and `gcController.fractionalMarkWorkersNeeded` into int32s, since those can get hit on every scheduling decision during GC, but those are also perfectly fine as int32s (I think I just made them int64s because we don't have atomic ops on int32).",
