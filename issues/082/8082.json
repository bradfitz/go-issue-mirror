	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eAn interface is a collection of method names and signatures.\n\nSay, we have:\n\npackage a\n\ntype Writer interface {\n\tWrite([]byte) (int, error)\n}\n\n\ntype WriterTo interface {\n\t WriteTo(Writer) (int64, error)\n}\n\ntype WriterTo2 interface {\n \tWriteTo(w interface{Write([]byte) (int, error)} (int64, error)\n}\n\n\nFrom the perspective of the one writing an implementation, the a.Writer\nand io.Writer are the same: As long as the Write method has the right\nsignature they are both fulfilled. \n\nHowever a.WriterTo and io.WriterTo are not, simply because they refer\nto Writers of different packages although they have the same definition. Even WriterTo2\nwould only be compatible with io.WriterTo if\nthey later had an anonymous interface too.\n\nsee \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/kOH11TOlsE\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/kOH11TOlsE\u003c/a\u003e\n\nSince interfaces are all about reusable code this behaviour must be \nconsidered an artifact of the way, interfaces are represented and treated during\ncompilation.\n\nSince interfaces have no methods and no values, their only value is to help the\nprogrammers via the type constraints. \n\nFrom the implementation perspective a.WriterTo, io.WriterTo and a.WriterTo2 must be\ntreated as being the same, a contraint to have a method WriteTo(w\ninterface{Write([]byte) (int, error)} (int64, error).\n\nThe names (and packages) of the interfaces should not be relevant for the compiler.\nInstead the definition should be the representation and the names just shortcuts to\nrefer to them.\u003c/pre\u003e",
