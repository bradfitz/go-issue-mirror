	"body": "As the title indicates, running go build on the same machine with no changes does not produce identical binaries on Windows even though it does on Linux/BSD.\r\n\r\nTo see this in action, run the following one-line command on Windows and Linux/BSD:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ mkdir $GOPATH/src/unstable; cd $GOPATH/src/unstable; echo \"package main; func main() {}\" \u003e main.go; go build -o a; go build -o b; openssl sha a b\r\n```\r\nOutput on Windows:\r\n\u003e SHA(a)= 5d5a08499e18e2475fb51d72eee2100afb8ec277\r\n\u003e SHA(b)= 49a016bf798c8a3c0fa88f06372303dd4b3f224f\r\n\r\nOutput on Linux:\r\n\u003e SHA(a)= 28f40782581aece883589efaa5dc5e269a46b71d\r\n\u003e SHA(b)= 28f40782581aece883589efaa5dc5e269a46b71d\r\n\r\nOutput on OpenBSD:\r\n\u003e SHA(a)= 962127cf3e97dd22aa8a879c9be58a9643ede0ae\r\n\u003e SHA(a)= 962127cf3e97dd22aa8a879c9be58a9643ede0ae\r\n\r\nFurther, I've compared the output of strings between the two binaries and there is no difference, but by doing `$ cmp --verbose --print-chars a b`, it appears to be a time stamp that is the cause.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nIssue submission questions:\r\n\r\n\u003e What version of Go are you using (go version)?\r\n\u003e What operating system and processor architecture are you using?\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ go version\r\ngo version go1.4.1 windows/amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003e What did you do?\r\n\r\nI ran the commands provided above.\r\n\r\n\u003e What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nThe generated binary should be identical and therefore have the same hash on Windows like it does on Linux and BSD.\r\n\r\n\u003e What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nThe generated binaries are not identical on Windows although they are on Linux/BSD.\r\n",
