	"body": "No.  The problem here is that vendoring makes the interpretation of an import path a function of two parameters, and the `go/types.Importer` interface exposes only one.  Ideally, we would add a `srcDir string` parameter to the interface's method, and its implementations would plumb this value through to `(*build.Context).Import`.  That, of course, would be an incompatible API change, though I suspect there are few if any clients that define their own Importer types.\r\n\r\n(It's possible that flipping the flag causes the tests to pass, but it wouldn't solve the general problem.)",
