	"body": "We should be able to parallelize large parts of cmd/compile to make builds faster.\r\n\r\nParsing could be done in parallel on multiple files in a package.\r\nTypechecking may be parallelizeable to some extent, I'm not sure.\r\nThings like escape analysis might have to remain serial.\r\nCompiling functions (order+walk+SSA+obj) can easily be done on each function in parallel.  My only concern is making sure we don't use too much memory.\r\n\r\nFor all of these changes, we'd need to de-globalize the current compiler.\r\n\r\nSee also #9887 #15736\r\n\r\n@josharian ",
