	"body": "Exhaustive tests (such as found in math/big and strconv) can generate a phenomenal number of errors when they fail. At some point, there is no value in additional errors.\r\n\r\nI think that we should maintain an error counter in `testing.T` and call `t.Fatal(\"too many errors\")` once we hit (say) 100 errors in a test.\r\n\r\ncc @adg and @robpike for feedback. I'll implement if you're ok with it, since this is a pain point for SSA development.\r\n",
