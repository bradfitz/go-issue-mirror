FWIW, this is the sort of thing I'm looking for, except that this program succeeds: http://play.golang.org/p/aW9S8XQcNJ.\r\n\r\nThe certs in that program are the samples that you linked to earlier. They are fine as far as I can tell. It should be the case that if you paste your real certificate into the program instead, the program should fail, with an error coming back from ParseCertificates.\r\n\r\nNote that 'BEGIN CERTIFICATE' data only contains a public key, not a private one. If you're worried about exposing the non-cryptographic details (view with `openssl x509 -in foo.crt -text`) publicly but are okay with emailing it to me (rsc@google.com), that's fine too.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
