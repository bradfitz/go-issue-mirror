	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eAnalyzing this program \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/aWILUB_GHi\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/aWILUB_GHi\u003c/a\u003e with vet, produces the\nfollowing problem\n\n\u0026gt; arg i for printf verb %p of wrong type: main.Foo\n\nThis occurs because the variable i is an interface and the function matchArgTypeInternal\nin go.tools/cmd/vet/types.go does not mark interfaces as OK for the verb %p. I would\nlike to propose that this usage is not marked as a problem, since the program executes\nwithout errors and prints the address to the interface.\n(Which is also the same address printed by the verbs %#v and %+v using the example\ncode.) I can send a CL if you like but I wanted to confirm first that this is not\nintentional since I could not find any documentation about it.\n\n$ go version\n\u0026gt; go version go1.3.2 linux/amd64\u003c/pre\u003e",
