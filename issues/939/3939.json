It's odd, though, and no longer necessary, if it ever\nwas. It also causes inconsistencies, since string(0xD800) cannot produce the UTF-8\nencoding for that code point (by definition, surrogates are not legal in UTF-8) so must\nproduce something else. We chose the \u0026quot;\\uFFFD\u0026quot; since that's the only reasonable\noption, but that means:\n\n1) the result isn't obvious\n2) string(0xD800) and \u0026quot;\\uD800\u0026quot; do different things: the former produces the\nUTF-8 for U+FFFD while the latter is statically rejected.\n\nI propose that, in some remote future, we eliminate this conversion from the language.\u003c/pre\u003e",
