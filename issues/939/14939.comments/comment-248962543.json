	"body": "\u003e I don't quite see how your proposal would correctly handle the case of a panic that occurs while executing a deferred function. At that point some of the deferred functions have been executed and some have not, but what is the PC value you will use to determine which remain to be executed?\r\n\r\nThat's a good question. If you're simply in the function epilogue executing local defers and one of them panics, then the PC in the epilogue tells you what's left. However, if you're running defers because of a panic and one of them panics, then you're right that things get more complicated. One possibility would be that when a panic happens, before running any defers, you walk the stack to find any frames that have PC value-based defers and weave those into the linked list of defers at the right points. Then panic just works from the linked list. If a second panic happens while walking this linked list, we know that we're already handling a panic, so it wouldn't rebuild the list, it would just keep going from the current list.",
