Unless, say, we record which defers need running by storing into a bitmask of defers-to-(not-)run; this would also handles Ian's problem.  Store a zero byte on entry, store a different value on the branches to the common area that don't enable all the defers.  PC range has to mention the location of the which-defers-not-to-run byte, of course.",
