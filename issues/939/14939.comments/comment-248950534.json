	"body": "A similar approach that might work would be to record a linked list of stack allocated deferred closures in the stack frame.  You could even choose to always start the list from the same place in the stack frame, just below the return address/frame pointer, so you would only need a single bit in the traceback information.  Then each time you defer a function, you update the linked list to point to the new stack allocated closure.  At the end of the function, you remove each closure from the list as you execute it.",
