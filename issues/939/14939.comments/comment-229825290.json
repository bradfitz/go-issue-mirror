And I actually don't think the runtime side of this is very complicated.\r\n\r\nThis is on the list for 1.8. I'm planning to either do it myself or get someone else to do it. :)\r\n\r\nIf it turns out we need to simplify things, we could limit this to defers with at most one (possibly implicit) argument, which would handle the cgo case as well as the mutex unlock case. Another possible simplification would be to only stack-allocate defers in functions where *all* defers can be stack allocated, which would probably simplify creating an efficient prologue.",
