In this case Go can have a\nbarrier over processes that will want to complete.\n\nI think I'm coding to a different set of problems at this point than other people.  In\nfact this makes me think I should want a \"reset\" function in my API so I can set the\nbarrier \"Check in\" count back to 0 for multi-stage algorithms that might need a few\nbarrier checkpoints over a set of goroutines.\n\nIn that case I don't want the goroutines to exit early.  I just want them to pause\nbefore continuing their work.\n\nI think our solutions and APIs start to diverge here :-)\u003c/pre\u003e",
