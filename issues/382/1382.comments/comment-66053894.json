I've got two\nexamples that look more like what I implemented than the proposed API.  (pthreads and\nMPI).\n\nIf this is properly a barrier, what's the other thing called? :-)  I guess that's for\nanother thread.  \n\nI think both APIs are useful, but I don't think it makes sense to combine them either as\nit kind of muddies either up a bit and makes it a little less clear how to use them.\n\nHonestly I'm just glad this is such an open process.\u003c/pre\u003e",
