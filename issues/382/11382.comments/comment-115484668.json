	"body": "A Go panic has a lot of technical similarities to Java exceptions, but several conventional differences. Java exceptions are part of normal programming, Go panics are not.\r\n\r\nWe may be able to match the conventions by throwing a java.lang.Error. While throwable, it's not a subclass of java.lang.Exception, so the usual ```try { } catch (Exception e) {}``` boilerplate won't get catch it.\r\n\r\n(It is more than a little confusing that Java Errors are like Go panics, and Java Exceptions are like Go errors.)\r\n\r\nThe only concern left is any potential performance impact from the defer/recover block, but I believe the language barrier will always incur a more significant overhead.",
