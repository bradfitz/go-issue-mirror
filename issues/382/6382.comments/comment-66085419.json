That panic at testUnixAddr is intentional to report \"guys, are you sure what\nare you doing right now on your node under the test?\". Also you need to extend some per\nprocess resources such as maximum number of file descriptors because Russ added a pretty\nbig dragon called TestDNSThreadLimit to nettest for Go 1.2. It consumes tons of threads\nand file descriptors, and leaves tons of worker threads during test.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/net/dialgoogle_test.go#110\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/net/dialgoogle_test.go#110\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Retracted**._",
