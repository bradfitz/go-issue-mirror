	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n1. Use a poor network connection. For example, on OS X, use the [Network Link\nConditioner](\u003ca href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9659382/installing-apples-network-link-conditioner-tool)\"\u003ehttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9659382/installing-apples-network-link-conditioner-tool)\u003c/a\u003e\nand enable profile \u0026quot;Edge, Lossy Network\u0026quot;.\n2. go test net\n3. Don't forget to turn off the Network Link Conditioner! I have wasted a few frustrated\nhours that way... :)\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nAt worst, a few test failures, perhaps for time-sensitive tests. At best, all tests pass.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nA slew of \u0026quot;too many open files\u0026quot; errors and a panic:\n\u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/josharian/6553711\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/josharian/6553711\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nOS X 10.8.4\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo version devel +238939762b61 Fri Sep 13 10:28:30 2013 +1000 darwin/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\n`go test net` passes in the same conditions with Go 1.1.1.\n\nI'm not really sure whether this is a bug; perhaps it is an expected side effect of\n\u0026quot;Go becoming a better citizen\u0026quot; (\u003ca href=\"http://www.honnef.co/go-tip/2013-08-30/)\"\u003ehttp://www.honnef.co/go-tip/2013-08-30/)\u003c/a\u003e. That\nsaid, it doesn't feel right--do I generally need to worry about panics when the network\nis poor?--so I thought I'd report it just in case.\u003c/pre\u003e",
