Unfortunately this function is not a lexical\ncleanup of a path -- it reaches out into the filesystem and reads links, which is very\ndifferent (eg, cannot clean up non-local paths; orders of magnitude performance\ndifference).\n\nIt appears to me that this is a specification error and should be correctable per Go 1\nAPI guarantee, as the documentation first guarantees an equivalent path then later\ndescribes an algorithm that does not return equivalent paths.\n\nI would expect developers to care more about the primary guarantee of an equivalent path\nthan a minor detail of the implementation and whether it removes a \"..\" sequence in some\ncases.\u003c/pre\u003e",
