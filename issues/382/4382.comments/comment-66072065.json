We are aware that removing .. can in the presence of symlinks result in\na different path. That is why the docs go out of their way to say that Clean only\nconsiders lexical equivalence, not actual file system equivalence.\n\nGo is not alone in this. Bash and other tools make the assumption too. See the first\npage of the dot-dot paper for an example.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
