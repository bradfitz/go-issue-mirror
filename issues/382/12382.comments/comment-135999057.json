In larger queries that have many steps and many queries in them that rely on the data passed to them this quickly becomes sub-optimal, possibly a deal breaker for large datasets where you don't want to send intermediate result sets back and forth. Again you can work around that with global or session temp tables, but again that isn't always optimal.",
