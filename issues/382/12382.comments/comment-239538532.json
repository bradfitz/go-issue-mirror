	"body": "Yeah, my example could be how you generically buffer all the result sets up before you deal with them.\r\n\r\nYour example would be how you might use it interactively.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that `rows.NextResultSet()` would involve reading the wire, so reading rows.Err() would be needed to call afterwords. So rather then panicing you'd probably want to `return errors.Wrap(rows.Err(), \"expected more rows\") or something like that.\r\n\r\nIt would work. I think it would be better then `Rows.NextResultSet() (bool, error)` as wouldn't need to deal with odd combinations, and behavior would depend on what order they were checked.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
