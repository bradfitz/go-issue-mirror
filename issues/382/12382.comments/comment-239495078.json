	"body": "@freeformz Yes, I think `Rows.NextResultSet()` would be more ideal. With the exception of certain drivers that give you the option of multiplexing multiple result at the same time (uncommonly used, only a few RDBMS support), result sets are streamed sequentially. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think the signature would be `func (Rows) NextResultSet() bool` (maybe also return an error?) and reuse the existing rows statement. After all, the previous result set can't be accessed anymore anyway and a new column list should be fetched as well.\r\n\r\n@bradfitz Opinion on this signature?\r\n",
