I thought I would see some unusual\noptions, but I don't.\n\nNext please try, in the misc/cgo/test directory\n    go test -work -ldflags \"-linkmode=internal\"\nThen cd to\n    $WORK/_/home/iant/go/misc/cgo/test/_test/_obj_test\nand run\n    objdump -dr _all.o\nWithin the first 20 lines or so there should be a reference to _cgoexp_NNNN_goCallback. \nAttach five or so surrounding lines in each direction.
