	"body": "dnsConfig currently reflects the contents of /etc/resolv.conf, but that means some of the fields need to be repeatedly processed in dnsclient_unix.go before being used.  For example, in tryOneName we have to call JoinHostPort every time for each queried server, producing extra garbage, or convert cfg.timeout to time.Duration.  (\\*dnsConfig).nameList could be simplified if we ensured search list entries always ended in a period.  Maybe there are more.\r\n\r\n/cc @dpiddy @bradfitz ",
