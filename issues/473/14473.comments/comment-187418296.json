Use `eg` to convert `NodeList` manipulations into methods.\r\n1. Create a `*[]*Node` type with those same methods.\r\n1. Profit.\r\n\r\nI did some work on (1) that never got mailed, for a variety of reasons. It is at the top of https://github.com/josharian/go/commits/nodelist/removal-prep. Some of it has been mailed by @davecheney and some of it (like the order.go work) has been duplicated. @mdempsky, please feel free to poke through those commits and appropriate anything you please. My time for contributing is now very limited and bursty, and this is not near the top of my list.\r\n\r\nMy attempts at (2) and (3) informed (1) above. I (obviously) never got it working.\r\n\r\nI'm glad that you're pursuing this.\r\n",
