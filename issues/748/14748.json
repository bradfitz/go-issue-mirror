	"body": "Currently, running the 'implements' query requires setting a scope. Is this necessary? Why is pointer analysis required for checking the implements relation? Why can't it default to the entire workspace, like 'referrers'?\r\n\r\nAlso, there's at least a bug here: `implements.go` checks if a scope has been provided, and if not, uses a different way of determining the packages. However, `len(q.Scope)` is always greater than 0. If no scope is provided, it's a slice with one element, the empty string.\r\n\r\n/cc @alandonovan ",
