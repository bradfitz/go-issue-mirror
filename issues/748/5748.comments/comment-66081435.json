So long as MakeStruct rejects structs whose fields\noverlap, you can't create pointer/uintptr union types.\n\nMakeStruct should probably also reject anonymous fields, since the resulting struct\ncould have a non-empty method-set but would have compiler-generated wrapper methods for\nthem.\u003c/pre\u003e",
