Moreover there's no way that\r\nwe can provide enough information in the resulting JSON (or YAML or ...)\r\nthat the original error can be reassembled.\r\n\r\nImplementing MarshalText on errors.errorString is never going to be that useful.\r\nIf you're marshaling an error, you're almost certainly making a mistake.\r\n\r\nFor the record, our approach to error marshaling is to have a function\r\nthat is called to explicitly transform errors to marshalable values,\r\n[for example](http://godoc.org/github.com/juju/httprequest#ErrorMapper):\r\n\r\n    func(err error) (httpStatus int, errorBody interface{})\r\n\r\nThat function can inspect the error and decide on how it should\r\nbe represented as an HTTP response (in this case), falling back\r\nto using the error string if it doesn't fit with any of the known types.\r\n\r\nThis is not something that can be done by the individual error types themselves,\r\nas an error may be used in many different marshaling contexts.",
