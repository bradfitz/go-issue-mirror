However, the current situation is such: referrers doesn't take a scope argument at all, and implements claims that it optionally takes one, but is broken if you don't provide it one.\r\n\r\nPersonally I'd like to standardize both queries on \"default to all, but do accept the -scope flag\".\r\n\r\n\u003e I like simply providing a stream of results and letting the user kill the task when they've had enough\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't really help when there's thousands of matches before the ones I care about appear. It also needs a lot more attention by the user now. Unless the editor provides a way to filter the list, but that's even more UI.",
