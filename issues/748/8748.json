	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe net.DNSError type has an IsTimeout field which seems to be set a single time inside\nthe Go-only resolver. Besides being public, this field is also the direct result of the\nDNSError.Timeout and DNSError.Temporary methods, which means all three are always false\nin a standard build, whether the error was a timeout or not.\n\nFound that out while looking at \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/8602\"\u003eissue #8602\u003c/a\u003e. Probably deserves to be documented, if not\nfixed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
