	"body": "by **jessevdk**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI've been using ast/parser and friends to parse some go sources. I've come across a nil\ndereference panic when processing a file containing errors. Specifically, I've tried to\nparse something like the following:\n\nimport (\n    \u0026quot;fmt\n)\n\nvar _ = fmt.Println\n\nfunc main() {\n}\n\nThe problem which occurs is that the resulting AST contains an ast.ImportSpec node with\na Path set to nil. This is ok, but s.Pos() will try to dereference the nil pointer when\ncalled. It would be nice if the ImportSpec node would still be able to report a valid\nPos.\n\nThis also affects go.tools/types which does not check for Path being nil.\u003c/pre\u003e",
