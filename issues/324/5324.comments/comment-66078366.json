If you do writes to the console, this is most likely not considered as\npreemption point now. However I am not sure why the goroutine is not preempted if you do\nnetwork IO. It should.\n\nWe should think about preemptive scheduling. Non-preemptive scheduler is too unintuitive\nand fragile.\u003c/pre\u003e",
