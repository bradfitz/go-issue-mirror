This is an implementation detail and different implementations will\nbehave differently.\n\nIn the current gc implementation there is no assumption that the select statement will\never enter the scheduler, whether or not there is a default case.\n\nThe use of the work \"blocks\" in the language spec should not be taken as an indication\nthat any other goroutine will get a chance to run.  In particular, \"blocks until one of\nthe communications can complete\" does not imply that the select statement will block at\nall, since it is possible that one of the communications can complete at the time the\nselect statement is entered.\u003c/pre\u003e",
