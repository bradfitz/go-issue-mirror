A running program runs one or more goroutines concurrently. Goroutines\nthat reach a statement that blocks (see 'receive statement' and 'select statement')\ncannot be run anymore until the unblocking condition is satisfied.\"\n\nThe reason why your program makes you unhappy is that your select statement is not \"a\nstatement that blocks\" according to the specification.\u003c/pre\u003e",
