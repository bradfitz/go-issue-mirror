The first rule should\nmaybe read\n\n  An element list that does not contain any keys must list\n  an element for each struct field in the order\tin which the\n  fields are declared.\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo version devel +fc8137c00f9c Sat Oct 13 19:05:22 2012 +0800\u003c/pre\u003e",
