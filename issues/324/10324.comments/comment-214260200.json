I use this very often to quickly open files and fix small mistakes when compiling.\r\n\r\nMost of the time the line number is enough, but at times it can be confusing. Example: https://play.golang.org/p/eFauWxodFX\r\n\r\nThis may sound silly since you can very quickly see the func signature and figure out which of the two `s` is causing the error. But in the more general case, it might not be as obvious. Having the compiler point at the line's byte offset for the identifier would be useful.",
