	"body": "@griesemer Thanks for the answer. It does make sense that there would be little interest in this functionality if none of the Go team is using an IDE (or graphical editor). As for efficiency though, wouldn't it be okay if the detailed tracking was only enabled with a compiler option? This way, an implementation that wasn't as efficient as ideally possible could be allowed in. \r\n\r\n@rsc A byte offset instead of code point would be very welcome too. The conversion back to code point could always be done back in the IDE, and it would be relatively straightforward.",
