A few people, including @robpike, are known for using proportional fonts in their editors. In this context \"column\" is less meaningful.\r\n\r\n\"column\" is just the term that it is called because its what it looks like on fixed-width fonts. Yes there are no columns in non-fixed-width fonts, but the term and the value are still useful. Just as software \"bugs\" are not actual insects, and when we save files we no longer save them in \"floppy disks\", but that is still the icon most graphical applications use. You can call it what you want, as long as the tool gives the value I want... :)\r\n\r\nI did give a definition of what I meant by \"column\" in my previous post, but I will clarify it:\r\nThe \"column\" of the start position of the error is:\r\n* The byte index of the character where the error starts, counting from the last newline (or from the beginning of the file if no newline exists before the error). This index can be a zero-based index, or a one-based index. (Most tools of other languages report it as one-based. For IDEs it makes no difference as it can easily be converted to the other)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, instead of a byte index, a **Unicode code** point index could be provided. *This is preferable.*",
