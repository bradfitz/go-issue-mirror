FWIW, the root cause of this bug probably may lie down on the protocol stack inside kernel (IP protocol control block bookkeepers and IO event notifiers), the runtime package (are we missing some important thing on epoll/kevent usage?), or the net package (are we testing it in the wrong direction?). The first analysis would just dissect the timeout TCP connection, by scraping the TCP information inside the kernel out.",
