However in Firefox - with and without pentadactyl\nplugin - and Chrome it is causing issues navigating via the keyboard. Simple page\nup/down has stopped working and trying to tab from the header to the main area so page\nup/down does work is hit and miss as there is no visible indication of where I have\ntabbed to within the menu.
