	"body": "Hi @aclements - here's an annotated graph of the normal heap size for this service. My general takeaway is that the heap size appears to be within expected bounds for this service, and the normal operating size does not appear to be \"changed\" as of 1.5.\r\n\r\n![heap-usage](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1119967/9390855/b37f576a-4741-11e5-8d1a-8ea7baafbbd4.png)\r\n\r\nThis service is essentially an HTTP cache using the [go-cache library](https://github.com/pmylund/go-cache/tree/93d85800f2fa6bd0a739e7bd612bfa3bc008b72d) with some additional features focused on analyzing the traffic it receives (those features being the primary reason this service exists). When this service is deployed (or re-spawned after a crash), it exhibits some oscillation for a short period of time, related to the initially-synchronized 10 minute cache entry TTLs, which explains the heap growth and then reduction that you're seeing. This behavior normalizes relatively quickly, and was \"normalized\" when these crashes occurred.",
