	"body": "Thanks for the outline of how to rebuild Go, that was very helpful. There were some minor details I had to tweak (Mainly, `GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP=/usr` needed to point all the way in at the go install, not just where bin/go is located), but I was successful.\r\n\r\nI was as rigorous as possible about using it to recompile my program, but there's a small chance I messed up rebuilding my program with the correct `go` compiler. It's probably fine though. I'd be sweet if `go version` output the git sha it was built from, if it was built from within a repository context.\r\n\r\nThat said:\r\n\r\nPrior to updating the binary:\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo cat /proc/`pidof $PROCESS`/smaps | grep ^Size -c\r\n131057\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter updating the binary and letting it get up to full-steam (about 27 minutes):\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo cat /proc/`pidof $PROCESS`/smaps | grep ^Size -c\r\n384\r\n\r\nEDIT: A couple minutes later:\r\n$ sudo cat /proc/`pidof $PROCESS`/smaps | grep ^Size -c\r\n276\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter restarting a not-updated binary and letting it get up to full-steam (about 18 minutes):\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo cat /proc/`pidof $PROCESS`/smaps | grep ^Size -c\r\n45242\r\n\r\nEDIT: A couple minutes later:\r\n$ sudo cat /proc/`pidof $PROCESS`/smaps | grep ^Size -c\r\n60518\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it looks like this change has had the intended effect.\r\n",
