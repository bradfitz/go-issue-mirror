But here's the exact sequence of commands that should build the right source:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://go.googlesource.com/go\r\ncd go\r\ngit checkout go1.5.1\r\ngit fetch https://go.googlesource.com/go refs/changes/91/15191/3\r\ngit cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD\r\ncd src\r\nGOROOT_BOOTSTRAP=/usr ./make.bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis assumes you have some Go version installed as /usr/bin/go, such as from your package manager. Tweak the GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP in the last line if it's somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThis should give you a go binary in go/bin that you can build with.",
