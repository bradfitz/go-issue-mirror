I think the workaround for #8832 may have dramatically increased the number of VMAs (mappings) in Go processes. Each VMA  has to have a consistent value of the HUGEPAGE flag, so if we change the flag for the middle of a VMA, it will be split from its neighbors. In Go 1.4 we didn't touch this flag and only did an madvise DONTNEED in the places where we now change the flag, which doesn't cause VMA spltting. I suspect the majority of the VMAs are adjacent to each other, but we're turning the heap into a mottled mess of differing HUGEPAGE flags.\r\n\r\nA way to test this theory would be to comment out the madvise(v, n, _MADV_HUGEPAGE) in sysUsed in runtime/mem_linux.go.",
