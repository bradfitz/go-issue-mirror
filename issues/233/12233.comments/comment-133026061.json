I suspect memory usage will do one of two things.\r\n\r\n1. climb slowly and inevitably towards a crash\r\n2. operate stably for a period of time, then skyrocket.\r\n\r\nThe gctrace log will show both. \r\n\r\nbtw. this information is always being collected, just normally supressed, so there is little impact in running it in production.",
