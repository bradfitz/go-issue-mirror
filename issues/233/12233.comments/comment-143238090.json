But the map you pasted is interesting because it looks like it's backed by a single 64K huge page, probably from Linux's transparent huge page support. The fact that you have lots of them smells very much like a kernel bug @randall77 tracked down a while ago where Linux was coalescing 64K ranges in to huge pages even when the range was only partially backed.",
