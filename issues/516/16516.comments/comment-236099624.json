If that's not the case for whatever reason adding `--checkout` to the `submodule update` command would force it to use its default behavior and should override your config setting:\r\n\r\n\u003e This option is only valid for the update command. Checkout the commit recorded in the superproject on a detached HEAD in the submodule. This is the default behavior, the main use of this option is to override `submodule.$name.update` when set to a value other than `checkout`. If the key `submodule.$name.update` is either not explicitly set or set to `checkout`, this option is implicit.",
