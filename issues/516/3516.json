	"body": "by **kballard**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe interface for time.Ticker makes it impossible to determine if any ticks have been\nskipped if the period is small. The difficulty lies in the fact that the underlying\ntimer has a \u0026quot;when\u0026quot; field that isn't exposed, and the client of the ticker\ncan't possibly know exactly what the value of \u0026quot;when\u0026quot; is. On each tick it's\ngiven the time that the tick was calculated at, but without the \u0026quot;when\u0026quot; field,\ndetermining if any ticks have been skipped is not possible with 100% accuracy. This is,\nof course, only a problem for very small periods.\n\nRather than exposing the \u0026quot;when\u0026quot; field, it's probably much simpler and better\nto simply create a second constructor that takes a Time and a Duration instead of just a\nDuration. This Time is used as the initial \u0026quot;when\u0026quot;. Not only does this make the\ncode for detecting skipped ticks rather trivial, it also allows for more flexibility in\ntimer creation for clients that need that.\u003c/pre\u003e",
