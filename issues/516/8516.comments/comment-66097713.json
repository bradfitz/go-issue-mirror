I'd suggest you to discuss at golang-dev because, a) DNS protocol\nitself never describes what's the right stub resolver, recursive server (known as cache\nserver) or authoritative server implementation even though a few supplemental RFCs are\npublished such as RFC 1912, b) NOC/NIC guys have a great knowledge about this section\nand major implementations usually follow their requests; e.g., years ago some\nimplmenetation allowed multiple CNAMEs but nowadays it's prohibited.\n\nIMHO,\n- multiple CNAMEs should be treated as error\n- if we want to handle circular CNMAEs, we should implement loop avoidance too\n- there are a few behavioural differences between primary stub resolver using\ngetaddrinfo or similar via CGO and builtin stub resolver, but we admit it because the\nbehavior of getaddrinfo is also different between platforms; e.g., glibc on Linux, BSD\nlibc on BSD variants and Windows.\n\nHope this helps.\u003c/pre\u003e",
