The current value has\nvery little meaning, it just being the time at which the runtime called nanoseconds()\nbefore starting to process the timers. All we really know about the time is that it's \u003e=\nthe fire date for any timers that get fired. By changing it to the actual fire date for\nthe timer in question (after accounting for missed ticks), the time value becomes more\nuseful.\u003c/pre\u003e",
