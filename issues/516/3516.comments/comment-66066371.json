I need to\nknow precisely when ticks have been skipped, so I can spin several cycles in the next\ntick to catch up.\n\nBecause of the lack of proper support for this in time.Ticker I was forced to roll my\nown solution, using a separate call to time.After every single time I needed to delay\n(which means almost 100,000 calls to time.After per second). Only this way was I able to\nkeep track of precisely when the next cycle was supposed to fire, so I could tell how\nmany ticks I needed to catch up.\u003c/pre\u003e",
