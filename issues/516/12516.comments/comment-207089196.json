The only functions that do not require it are functions from which no SEH exception may ever be thrown.  Transitively.  That means that ANY function that may call into C needs unwind info.\r\n\r\nOne alternative is to only call into C via an assembler trampoline that ensures no Go code is on the stack when C code is executing.",
