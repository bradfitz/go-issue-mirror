	"body": "@bcantrill asked of Go recently:\r\n\r\n\u003e I've never gotten a straight answer as to why Go makes system calls directly instead of doing what every other program on the planet does and calling into the system libraries. Certainly, it made the ports to non-Linux systems absolutely brutal: systems are required to make themselves look like Linux for Go to function correctly. So yes, this is unenlightened -- or perhaps it's a conscious attempt to make Go unportable?\r\n\r\nAnd another thread recently happened on the mailing list about the `g`, `m`, and `p` internal runtime structures.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to think we should have a documentation page for internals FAQs.\r\n\r\nThe closest we have now is a link from https://golang.org/doc/ to [Go Slices: usage and internals](https://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals)\r\n\r\nBut there's more content not as well linked:\r\n\r\n* http://research.swtch.com/interfaces\r\n* http://research.swtch.com/gorace\r\n* http://research.swtch.com/randhash\r\n* http://blog.altoros.com/golang-part-1-main-concepts-and-project-structure.html (6 parts)\r\n\r\nThere's some good stuff in https://golang.org/wiki/DesignDocuments too, but that's also not well linked.\r\n",
