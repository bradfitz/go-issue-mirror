	"title": "x/sys/unix: Add support for SocketCAN ",
	"body": "The unix.Sockaddr interface has a package local method and therefore cannot be implemented outside of the golang.org/x/sys/unix package, and without an appropriate Sockaddr structure for CAN it is impossible to create a SocketCAN socket type.  (See discussion here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/5HTN3QVC_lQ).\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to add a SockaddrCAN struct for wrapping the sockaddr_can structure defined in \u003clinux/can.h\u003e so that SocketCAN can use all the socket related functions from the package.\r\n\r\nPatch: https://github.com/elliotmr/cantest/blob/master/unix.diff\r\nTest Code: https://github.com/elliotmr/cantest",
