This is the case if the command is\nuname, echo, or if it's go commands like gomake and gofmt.  \n\nThis can only lead me to believe that it must be some interaction between dorun (and\nmore specifically probably os.StartProcess) and how it is executing the instructions vs.\nif it were run without os.StartProcess. \n\nI am not sure if it's just virtualbox by itself, because that would have to mean\nexecuting commands from shell should be slow too.  \n\nIs there a chance that os.StartProcess wouldn't play well in virtualized environments?\u003c/pre\u003e",
