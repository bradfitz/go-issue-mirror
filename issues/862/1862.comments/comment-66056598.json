Everything\nafter the process has been forked is slow.  The mmap2 before that are about 3-4ms, which\nis similar to systrace2.txt.  But after the fork, the mmap2 syscalls jump up to\n200-300ms.  It's not just mmap2 though; it's almost any syscall from the forked process.\n\nI have an Intel Core 2 Duo T9400, but I only dedicated one CPU to the virtual machine. \nWould that have anything to do with it?\u003c/pre\u003e",
