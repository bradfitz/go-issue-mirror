The main portion of the gotest program is 435 lines,\nwhich is far to large. It should be whittled down to a few pertinent lines.\n\nFor example, I did a first cut by creating the attached dorun.go program. It uses gotest\ndoRun function code to run uname, a simple and fast command. Here are my results. What\nare your results?\n\n$ 8g dorun.go\n$ 8l -o dorun dorun.8\n$ time ./dorun\ngotest 0.00s: uname\n [+0.01s]\nLinux\nreal\t0m0.020s\nuser\t0m0.004s\nsys\t0m0.004s\n$ time uname\nLinux\nreal\t0m0.010s\nuser\t0m0.004s\nsys\t0m0.004s\n$\u003c/pre\u003e",
