I recently\nread that cygwin had a problem where forking on windows was really slow for a while, and\nalthough vbox isn't exactly cygwin, i wouldn't be surprised if there were a similar\nissue.  And plus there have been complaints about the state of vbox ever since it was\nacquired. \n\nIt's enough to make me throw my hands up and consider the alternatives. I haven't\nentirely made a decision yet, but I'm considering just reinstalling linux to work\ndirectly off my machine now.\u003c/pre\u003e",
