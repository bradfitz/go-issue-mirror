For example, `*` matches symlinks to other directories. `**` cannot, at least not without extra work to avoid file system cycles. Also it's not obvious this should be considered a backwards compatible change, both for Glob and for Match. And you'd probably want to do path.Match as well. There's a lot to consider here, even though it looks trivial.",
