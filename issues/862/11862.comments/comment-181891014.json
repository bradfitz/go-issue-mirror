Thus `**` is equally well defined as matching zero or more non-separator characters, followed by a match of zero characters on the tail of the same filename.\r\n\r\nThe proposed special-casing of `**` will certainly not match less than it does now, but may match more, and the question is whether existing programs _could_ become broken through what constitutes a change in behavior.",
