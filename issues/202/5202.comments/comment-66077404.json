I realize now that what I wanted is not that actually\nthat common. \n\nWhat I meant was that this isn't supported currently:\n\ntime.Parse(\"2006-01-02 15:04:05 America/Phoenix\", \"2006-01-02 14:04:05\nAmerica/Los_Angeles\") \n\nMy reference is joda-time where 'Z' can be used to parse a timezone id\n(\u003ca href=\"http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html)\"\u003ehttp://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html)\u003c/a\u003e. On\none hand, full timezone ids are safer than 3 letter codes because they are unique and\ninclude DST info but on the other hand, systems that format date/time in such a way are\nindeed rare. \n\nI guess the question comes down to focusing the support on the more common cases out\nthere or trying to pave the way for better time handling. Does that make sense?\u003c/pre\u003e",
