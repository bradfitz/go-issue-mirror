But since most people are wrapping code which lives in a single namespace, I\nthink it is easier for the Go code to not require that.  The Go code will most likely\nalready live in different packages, so there is no name collision on the Go side.\n\nInstead, in the rare case where you need to wrap C++ code which lives in multiple\nnamespaces, I think people can use SWIG's %rename and %ignore directives to get the\nright thing to happen.\n\nLet me know if you see a real problem with this approach.\u003c/pre\u003e",
