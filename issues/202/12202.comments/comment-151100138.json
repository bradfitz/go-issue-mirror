Again, no change to the standard library is needed.\r\n\r\nThe Options.SkipSOI proposal has the same fundamental problem as the original Options.App1Data proposal: any hacky workaround added to the standard library has to be kept for the lifetime of Go 1.x. I don't see the need for a hacky workaround in the standard library when you can just as easily hack a workaround outside the standard library.",
