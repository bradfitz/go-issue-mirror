Also, if we don't allow them, we'd need at least one extra rule (a sentence) in\nthe spec. Permitting them does seem to be more regular, which is why I lean towards that\ninterpretation.\n\n(As an aside, there are similar, but not related, corner cases with blank method names\nin interfaces, see issues 6604, 6606. Not sure it does or should have any bearing on\nthis issue.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
