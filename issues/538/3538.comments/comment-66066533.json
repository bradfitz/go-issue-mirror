So having\nr.URL.Path == \"\" makes good sense to me.\n\nhttp.ServeMux is designed for a web server, not a proxy, so it's not too surprising that\nit has problems with CONNECT requests. Its path-based distribution of requests is likely\nnot what you need either. So you should probably create your own type (fulfilling the\nhttp.Handler interface) and pass an instance of it as the second argument to\nListenAndServe, bypassing ServeMux entirely.\n\nIf you do need ServeMux's routing facilities, make your type call\nhttp.DefaultServeMux.ServeHTTP when it gets a request that should be routed that way.\u003c/pre\u003e",
