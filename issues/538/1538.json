	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eHi,\n\nthis is more a wishlist than a defect.  And it will get more important in the long run\n(when go stabilizes).\n\nIt would be beneficial if godoc could pregenerate pretty printed HTML pages for all the\npkg/, cmd/ and src/ trees.  This will make the packaging of golang more compliant with\nFHS and more clean (IMO) since I won't have to include the whole source code into the\npackage.\n\nThe other part would to that godoc would be able to use the pregenerated files (stored\nin the same directory structure) - or one would just point it's browser to\n/usr/share/doc/golang-doc/html/index.html.\n\nI have tried using the godoc -html=true, but the resulting HTML is really simple and\nthere's no easy way how to incorporate it into the whole documentation package.  (Also\nthere's no way how to generate f.e. /src/pkg/runtime/type.go by hand or at least I don't\nknow how...)\u003c/pre\u003e",
