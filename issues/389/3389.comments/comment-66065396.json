Or is the whole cmd/* reserved? If it is, an error might be better than\nhaving it mostly work.\"\n\nBased on Russ's comment here, it seems the answer is that cmd/* is reserved if you are\nin a GOROOT project. Maybe the go tool shouldn't build anything under any GOPATH's\nsrc/cmd directory then? I can see other people making the same mistake as we have.\n\nsrc/pkg sorted itself out, because there your import path would be pkg/foo, which no-one\nwants.\u003c/pre\u003e",
