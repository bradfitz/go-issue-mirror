You make a system call.  You block.  The scheduler runs.  You unblock. \nYou come back in a different thread.  You unlock the mutex with an XRELEASE instruction.\n The unlock fails.  Execution resumes back at the XACQUIRE lock.  But you're running on\na different core.  Can that really work?\n\nMy point is that you need to know what happens between the XACQUIRE and the XRELEASE. \nOr so it seems to me.\u003c/pre\u003e",
