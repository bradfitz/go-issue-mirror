It will work.\nBut good heuristics are critical for efficient HLE. With the proposed new semantics we\npermanently fall back to locking iff encounter something that we can't handle within\ntransaction (e.g. a syscall). But unlock in a different thread will look like normal\ncontention (it will be detected earlier when the goroutine passes responsibility to\nunlock mutex to a different goroutine), so condition for permanent fallback to locking\nbecomes moot; and if we don't fallback (always try to execute transactionally several\ntimes first), we will waste lots of work.\n\nStatic analysis don't have dynamic information, so it won't work for static analysis.\n\nDynamic analysis may or may not work, I don't know yet how to implement it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
