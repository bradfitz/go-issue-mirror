	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI've got some code that uses github.com/steveyen/gkvlite and works fine under 1.0.3, but\nnot under tip.\n\ngkvlite compiles and tests cleanly, but when I try to import it into this other project:\n github.com/couchbaselabs/cgbg it fails to compile:\n\n./compact.go:13: cannot convert gkvlite.nodeLoc literal (type gkvlite.nodeLoc) to type\nunsafe.Pointer\n\nLine 13 is attempting to *import* this package.  It's quite possible there's something\nwrong with this code, but the compiler error is describing a conversion that isn't\noccurring here (and can't since the type it's referring to is private).  I've imported\nthat into trivial programs and it doesn't *always* break, so I'm struggling to figure\nout how to appease the compiler gods here.\n\n\nI bisected the compilation failure to the following change:\n\nchangeset:   15574:f9987258f37a\nuser:        Russ Cox \u0026lt;rsc@golang.org\u0026gt;\ndate:        Fri Feb 01 23:10:02 2013 -0500\nsummary:     cmd/gc: reject non-Go constants\u003c/pre\u003e",
