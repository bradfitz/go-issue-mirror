These should be present on OpenBSD, FreeBSD \u0026 Darwin. On Linux, TIOCGETA \u0026\nTIOCSETA don't seem to exist at all.\n\nIn fact, none of the TIOC flags were in sysctl *at all* until r59.\n\nTCGETA/TCSETA (/usr/include/asm-generic/ioctls.h) appear to be the closest equivalents,\nbut these are ignored by the script that generates zerrors_*.go in src/pkg/syscall.\n\nI'm not sure what Go's stance is on cross-platform incompatibilities regarding things\nlike this. It may be that we want to include TC{S,G}ETA in syscall on Linux, we want to\nalias them to TIOC{S,G}ETA respectively, or of course continue to leave them out on\nLinux ...\u003c/pre\u003e",
