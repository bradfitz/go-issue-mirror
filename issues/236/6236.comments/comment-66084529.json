And if you're running\ncurrent you should be following the FAQ:\n\n  \u003ca href=\"http://www.openbsd.org/faq/current.html\"\u003ehttp://www.openbsd.org/faq/current.html\u003c/a\u003e\n\nOn the 13th of August there was a system ABI break on OpenBSD:\n\n  \u003ca href=\"http://www.openbsd.org/faq/current.html#20130813\"\u003ehttp://www.openbsd.org/faq/current.html#20130813\u003c/a\u003e\n\nPart of this involved changes to system calls, hence the ENOSYS error when you're trying\nto run Go. I'm not yet sure how we will handle this in the upstream code base, however\nthe version that is in ports has already been patched. For now you should install and\nuse the port instead.\n\nRe gdb, the version that is in base (6.3) does not understand the DWARF information in\nthe Go binaries. You'd need to install a newer version from ports.\u003c/pre\u003e",
