Currently the code looks like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nif ext.Id.Equal(subjectAltName) {\r\n    var altName asn1.RawValue\r\n    asn1.Unmarshal(ext.Value, \u0026altName)\r\n    if altName.Class == 0 \u0026\u0026 altName.Tag == 16 {\r\n        data := altName.Bytes\r\n        for len(data) \u003e 0 {\r\n              var alt asn1.RawValue\r\n              data, _ = asn1.Unmarshal(data, \u0026alt)\r\n              if alt.Class == 2 {\r\n                  switch (alt.Tag) {\r\n                  case 0:\r\n                      ...\r\n                  }\r\n              }\r\n          }\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see there's a lot of magic numbers there. Almost all of those are defined constants in asn1/common.go, but they're set to private, so I can't use them. I don't think they should be private since they're well defined ASN.1 constants.",
