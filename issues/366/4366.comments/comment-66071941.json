After Stop, no more ticks will be sent.\n\nif we close the channel, i think it is almost equivalent to sending a new (zero) tick.\n\nOn the other hand, if we don't close the channel, this means uncollectable\ngarbage (if the user isn't using another form to notify tick's receiver goroutine,\nbut that will be rare).\n\nFYI, we have a test in tick_test that verify after Stop(), we won't receive anything\nfrom C.\n\u003ca href=\"http://tip.golang.org/src/pkg/time/tick_test.go#L28\"\u003ehttp://tip.golang.org/src/pkg/time/tick_test.go#L28\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
