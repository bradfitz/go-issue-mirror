It might also help to link to whatever seems most definitive about \"how to determine Android DPI in practice\". A quick query to my favorite search engine turned up http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#dips-pels but you might know of better resources.\r\n\r\nIt might also be nice to check in an example program, or modify the example/basic program, to draw a centered square that is 1 inch by 1 inch under the existing green triangle that follows touches. Maybe @crawshaw would have a better idea of a good DPI example.",
