The height reported is not the full pixel height of the device but that is normal on android as the system will subtract height of status bar and software device buttons (if they exist) before fulfilling a height request to an app.\r\n\r\nThe reported width on the other hand seemed enough to suggest there is an issue though. The device has precisely 720px width which is correct as reported but the pt value reported doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nI was going to dig into this eventually to implement density-independent-pixels and the first thing I'd like to check is pt value reported by the java api. At the very least, that result should match the gomobile result, even if incorrect.\r\n\r\nI've also never worked with pt values outside of some graphic software so my expectations may simply be wrong as well.",
