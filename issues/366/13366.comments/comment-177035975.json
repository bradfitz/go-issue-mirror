	"body": "The table here is a good example of how this works: https://www.google.com/design/spec/layout/units-measurements.html#units-measurements-density-independent-pixels-dp-\r\n\r\nThe footnote suggests a device with 1.5 inch width and doing the math for 160dp is an example of how you'd end up at exactly 1 inch. But, consider the same table for a device with 2 inch width and then you'd end up at 1.33 inches.\r\n\r\nOn my 2.45\" width device I referenced in the original issue, a 1 inch square would be 1.225 inches as it falls into the 320 bucket density. A 2\" width device with the same resolution would also fall into the 320 bucket density and a 1\" square would actually be 1\".\r\n\r\nThe density bucket is also apt to tampering by the hardware vendor.\r\n\r\nSo, for clarification, the gomobile example of drawing a 1\" square wouldn't necessarily be 1\" but it would look consistent across similar devices.",
