	"body": "I'm in the situation of using gl.UniformMatrix4v with a f32.Mat4 instance. However, the function takes a []float32 slice as argument. I see an inconsistency in that but perhaps I'm missing something. I wonder if gl.UniformMatrix4v could take a f32.Mat4 as argument or if an f32.Mat4 instance can conveniently be converted in a []float32 slice.
