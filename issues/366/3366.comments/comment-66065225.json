In particular, on POSIX os.Rename is atomic, in the sense\nthat if the destination path already exists, any other process can always open the\ndestination path and get either the old file or the new file.  Since we can't provide\nidentical semantics on different operating systems, I don't think we should try to go\nbeyond what the OS provides.  There is no one right choice.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
