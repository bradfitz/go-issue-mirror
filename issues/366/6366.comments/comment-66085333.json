Please file a separate issue for gccgo.\n\nRe #8, Robert, I think these are separate issues. They're obviously both involving\npointers, but I don't think the resolution of \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/58860043\"\u003eissue #58860043\u003c/a\u003e affects this.\n\nRe #11, Alan, I think you're wrong about the spec sentence being redundant. It is needed\nto justify automatic indirect of selectors for fields. Otherwise I don't see what\njustifies that given:\n\n    type T struct {\n        x int\n    }\n    var t *T\n\nyou are allowed to refer to t.x as shorthand for (*t).x.\u003c/pre\u003e",
