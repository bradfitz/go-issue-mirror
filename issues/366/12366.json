	"body": "GOTRACEBACK controls what gets printed on failure. By default \"a failure prints a stack trace for every extant goroutine, eliding functions internal to the run-time system, and then exits with exit code 2.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we there was a variant that printed just the offending goroutine, which is usually what you care about during development.",
