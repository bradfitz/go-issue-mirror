	"body": "I'd like to try showing only one goroutine during the freeze. I am not sure it's the right thing to do, but it's at least plausible. I certainly understand the \"but there's good information there!\" counter-argument, but I thought the same thing abot eliding runtime frames, and I worry about being too conservative here (\"it's always been that way\") and thereby discounting what may be a good idea (as my initial reply did). We won't know unless we do the experiment, and the freeze seems as good a time as any to do it.\n\nI will send a CL adding GOTRACEBACK=single and making it the default. I will file a separate issue to decide whether to restore the default for Go 1.6.\n\nThanks again for the proposal, @idank.",
