	"body": "@jimmyfrasche Please don't use SQLite as an example. If you are using SQLite, today's API is perfect. However every other RDBMS out there has a strong notion of type internally and in interfaces.\r\n\r\nAs for variety, I've done the survey. What you have in the rdb Types is like 99% of types used. There really isn't that much variety. go type string is either varchar, char, nvarchar, varchar2, or text (and varchar2 is an oracle specific type and can be ignored for our use, can be provided by driver). That's it. Numeric types are generally all tinyint, smallint int, bigint. There are custom types: SQL server allow .Net types to be defined, including table types, postgres allows arrays and other types. But... I think we can let drivers define those types.\r\n\r\nSo, yes, sqlite doesn't care about types, so the current API is perfect for it. However other databases care (for at least performance) if your param is a varchar(10) or a nvarchar(-1). If it isn't meaningful for the database system in question, ignore it. But that is mostly just sqlite where you would.\r\n\r\n",
