	"body": "@bradfitz Proposal for result type information.\r\n\r\nI've used the result types from queries in a number of places (C# ADO.Net, and go rdb). Whereas for query parameters where you want to specify in unusual cases the specific actual database type (varchar vs nvarchar vs text), the results I have typically used the generic type (text, date, date+time of day, decimal, floating point, integer, array, structured (JSON, XML)).\r\n\r\nI can think of three ways to specify this generic type:\r\n * Define a const type list in `database/sql`, in Schema.Column define a GenericType.\r\n * Define a const type list per driver that support it, in Schema.Column define a GenericType.\r\n * In Schema.Column define ZeroType which contains the zero value of the corresponding go type.\r\n\r\nWhile I view the generic type as most important for results, I would also like to allow fetching the database specific type. I could see this as either a type const defined in the driver or in `database/sql`.\r\n\r\nAre there any of these options that you would *not* want to see in the `database/sql` package? Or do you have other opinions? I can send in a more specific proposal after I get that bit of feedback. Thanks.",
