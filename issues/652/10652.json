	"body": "There are two copes of `Biobuf` in the compiler, `cmd/internal/obj/util.go` and `cmd/internal/ld/util.go`. Both are in various stages of decomposition, for example 05d53165 was applied to the latter, but not the former. The former has sort of had 05d53165 applied accidentally, and now `Bungetc` is inconsistent, some methods check the unget buffer, others do not.\r\n\r\n- If there must be a wrapper around `bufio.Buffer`, then there should be at most one in the compiler.\r\n- Preferably we should be using `bufio.Buffer` directly everywhere.\r\n\r\n@rsc @robpike thoughts ?",
