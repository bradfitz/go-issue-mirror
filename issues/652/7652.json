	"body": "by **watsonbladd**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eECDSA.go uses Math.BigInt to invert k. However, the inversion is not constant time as it\nuses the Euclidean algorithm without blinding. This leaks information about k, which is\nfairly bad for ECDSA security. In particular the runtime gives me the length of the\ncontinued fraction expansion of k/q. Whether or not this is enough information to\ncompromise the private key remains to be seen.\n\nTwo possible solutions are to blind the inversion, or to use modular exponentiation to\ncompute the inverse instead.\n\nCredit belongs to Martin Rex of SAP for informing me that this sort of leakage had been\nused to compromise smart cards in the past.\n\nSincerely,\nWatson Ladd\u003c/pre\u003e",
