Constants don't have\nthe type of their literal; they are untyped.  We don't want to use the word \"type\" here.\n\nThe spec already says \"There are boolean constants, rune constants, integer constants,\nfloating-point constants, complex constants, and string constants\" and \"A constant value\nis represented by a rune, integer, floating-point, imaginary, or string literal.\"  Later\nin the same section the spec says that implementations may have restrictions on the\nprecision they use to represent integer and floating-point constants.\n\nSo in fact I think everything is fine, or, at least, that the spec is consistent.  But\nplease feel to disagree.\u003c/pre\u003e",
