Without rewriting it as a tool that\nactually parses Go source code, it is not possible to avoid all possible such bugs. \nConsider\n\n/*\npackage x\n*/\npackage y\n\nSince it's very easy to change your source code to avoid the confusion, I suggest doing\nthat for now.  One day gotest may be rewritten but it serves well enough for now that,\nwith regret, I will retire this issue.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
