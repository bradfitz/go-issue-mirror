I was trying to figure how to\nwrite my own utimensat (unimplemented) and I was having a very hard time. What is more,\nreading the source of the package doesn't really help, as its code is supposed to be\ngoing through mksyscall.\n\nWhat I would like to see:\n\n1. An example of writing an unimplemented syscall.\n\n2. How to pass arguments to syscalls (eg. strings should be pointers to nul terminated\nbyte sequences.\n\n3. Information how to get the right uintptr (reflect or unsafe, when to use each of\nthem).\n\n4. Documentation any types introduced.\n\n5. A little bit of background information about syscalls would be nice, but that's not\nstrictly necessary.\u003c/pre\u003e",
