Working as intended.\n\nYes, the memory from Handle might not be collected as aggressively as possible, but\nthat's the stack-precise GC that Carl is working on in \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/5134\"\u003eissue #5134\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nBut this program in comment #7 still has a leak.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Invalid**._",
