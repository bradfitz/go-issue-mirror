Also I'm not sure if it works as it should in edge case tests like `\u003cnoscript\u003e\u003ciframe\u003e\u003c/noscript\u003e`. All tests are updated to new version so I think for one of the core package maintainers shouldn't be hard to understand what has been changed and check if it works OK.",
