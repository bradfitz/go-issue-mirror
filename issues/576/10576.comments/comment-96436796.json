	"body": "This can only happen in testing.  From what I can tell, this is caused by starting multiple instances of loadConfig during testing.  The parameters do not allow for the refresh time nor the quit method to be changed or accessed from the outside.   So if any lookup happens before these series of tests, it will be racy since all lookups call loadConfig.\r\nI believe fixing this properly will require redoing the current implementation as I'd tried to sneak through.\r\n\r\nI'll resubmit a full proper fix for this after fix for 10566 goes through, though it's still a rather big change.",
