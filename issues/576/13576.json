	"body": "During the translation of various C code to Go code (presumably), it looks as though the standard Go copyright header and license notice were combined with the existing Inferno/Plan9 license in a single file.  The pattern typically seen is the top of the file has this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Copyright 2009 The Go Authors. All rights reserved.\r\n// Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style\r\n// license that can be found in the LICENSE file.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is then followed eventually by an old Inferno/Plan9 copyright notice like this one:\r\n```\r\n// Inferno utils/include/ar.h\r\n// http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/source/browse/utils/include/ar.h\r\n//\r\n//      Copyright � 1994-1999 Lucent Technologies Inc.
