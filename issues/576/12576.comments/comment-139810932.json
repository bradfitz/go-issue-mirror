If we were looking for a least-impact way to break compatibility, this might be it.\r\n\r\nIf we were especially paranoid about this change we could do it in two dot releases -- in one, we warn that float32(-0) and float32(-1e-1000) will convert to -0.0 in the next dot release, and in the next we change it.  The fix is trivial, and even if unfixed it's not that likely to cause problems.",
