In this case, does the constant silently underflow to -0 or 0?\r\n\r\nOr in other words, should:\r\n```\r\nvar x float64 = 1e-1000 // underflows to 0\r\ny := -x // y == -0\r\n```\r\nproduce the same result as:\r\n```\r\nvar x float64 = -1e-1000 // currently underflows to 0 even though value is negative\r\ny := x // y == 0\r\n```\r\n",
