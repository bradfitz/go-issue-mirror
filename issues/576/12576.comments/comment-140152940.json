We have scientific notation for representing a real number, which we then represent as a floating-point number when necessary. This may sound pedantic and you may disagree, but I believe this is true and that it's important to keep the wretched peculiarities of floating-point arithmetic from leaking back across the boundary. For instance, there are no NaNs in Go constants and there shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nThere should be no negative zero in Go constants. There is no such thing as a true negative zero anywhere, there is only a fiction called negative zero that is an accident of the way floating point numbers are represented in computer memory.\r\n\r\nGo constants are (or used to be) called \"ideal constants\" for a reason.",
