Linux on-line manual\ndoesn't say nothing about the case of receiving, maybe Solaris and OS X too.\n\nBut I believe other reviews will find out a good solution for that.\n\nP.S.\nThat field represents when the destination address field of received packets has:\n- unicast address: host receiver did RIB lookup and put the result to the field\n- limited/directed broadcast address: ??? (depends on platform implementations?)\n- multicast address: ditto\n- IP tunneling or translations: ???
