Can you please elaborate more on \"the Src address when a packet\nis received. This is the local address that the packet was received on.\" ?\n\nFrom API design point of view, I don't understand why we should call the field \"SpecDst\n(specific destination, uh, for what?)\".\n\nWe use that field when we want to specify a node-local source address for the routing\ntable lookup and for setting up IP source route options. Also we use that field when we\nwant to know the last hop address on a reverse-path (not sure in the case of IP-over-IP\ntunneling or NAT/NAPT; probably it returns the result of innermost IP routing?).\n\nIn both case, the field represents an address of the routing stuff; in terms of\nlocator/ID separation, it represents an IP-layer topological locator and doesn't\nrepresent an IP-layer endpoint identifier. That's the reason why I don't understand the\nfield is called \"Dst (destination)\" instead of \"Hop (routing hop)\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
