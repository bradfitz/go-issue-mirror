This is available when IP_PKTINFO is set.\n\nIt's necessary when the IP address that a packet is received on is required, rather than\nthe header destination address (which is what Dst represents).\"\n\nThe name SpecDst is simply adapted from the referred man pages and C header files in\nLinux. Please have a good read there.\n\nI'm sorry I don't see the relevance of your last paragraph.\n\nThanks for your patience with this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
