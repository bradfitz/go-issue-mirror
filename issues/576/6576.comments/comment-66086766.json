The\ncurrent output is the result of running \"go help\" or \"go -h\", etc.\n\nIt's nice for folks running tests to see the flags that the current test execution\nexpects, in the most intuitive way. Sample output:\n\ngo test [-h | -? | help]\n\nUsage of /home/all/tmp/go-build595553679/ugorji.net/codec/_test/codec.test:\n  -bd=1: Bench Depth: If \u003e1, potential unreliable results due to stack growth\n  -tdbg=false: Test Debug\n  -test.bench=\"\": regular expression to select benchmarks to run\n...\n\nFor more detailed information on the standard test flags, run \"go help testflag\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
