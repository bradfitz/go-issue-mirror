The freeze started on May 1st, and this was sent after May 1st, and this was not tagged as a Go 1.5-blocking issue.\r\n\r\nAs such, this has to wait until Go 1.6.\r\n\r\nI've marked that CL with R=close so it doesn't show up on our dashboard, but pinging this thread at any time will make it reappear. Please reply to this bug after August 1st and we can begin the code review.\r\n\r\nThanks for working on this, though!",
