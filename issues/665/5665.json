	"body": "\u003cpre\u003ego clean blindly removes files with the same name of the directory.  At some point in\nthe past I began naming my github repos something.go, often containing a source file\ncalled something.go, which clean blindly removes.\n\nIdeally, the clean tool would know that the package isn't main so the build tool\nwouldn't produce a file called DIR.\n\nThis isn't particularly difficult to work around, but the behavior is unexpected and has\ncaused confusion a few times when cleaning up caused my compiles to fail by deleting\ndependency source code.\u003c/pre\u003e",
