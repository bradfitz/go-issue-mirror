	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe http Client should probably support Expect: 100-continue.  The server does.\n\nIt does introduce a new round-trip, though, so we should probably only send it when the\ndata size exceeds some threshold.  Probably the same threshold we use for consuming\nrequest bodies when a handler doesn't (maxPostHandlerReadBytes).\n\nI think we could see if we know the size of the request body (just as NewRequest does,\nchecking for a few known types), but if the Body is non-nil and the ContentLength is\n\u0026lt;=0 (unknown), we instead slurp up the Body into a bytes.Buffer to see if it's \u0026gt;=\nsomeThreshold.  If so, we replace the Body with a io.MultiReader(slurped, rest) and\nproceed to do a 100-continue.  If not, we blast it away HTTP/1.0-style.\u003c/pre\u003e",
