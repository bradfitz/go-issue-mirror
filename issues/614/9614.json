	"body": "In revision f956740163ad4b46237cea83357b962cada1c2df the function setKeepAlivePeriod in the net package was changed on Solaris to use TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL.  However, I am told that on Solaris 11.2, those symbols are not defined.  They are defined in our syscall package because they are defined on Illumos, which is derived from OpenSolaris.  If we want Go to have support for Solaris proper, not just OpenSolaris, we should probably go back to the earlier Solaris-specific version of setKeepAlivePeriod.\r\nï¿¼",
