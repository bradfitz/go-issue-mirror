Maybe we'll have a chance to revisit this, such beauty in Go 2\nbut I personally want to fix the issue \"net package is weird because it returns weird\nerrors\" first. So I'm gonna close this issue for now.\n\nDave, \n\n\u003e we switched to the runtime poller for the *BSDs.\n\nActually no, in a series of Happy Eyeballs CLs. See changeset: 17772:3833ddddde2b. FWIW,\nnet.Listen already behaves so since Go 1.0. Also both net.Dial and net.Listen still\nreturn a nil interface on error when you give invalid arguments.\u003c/pre\u003e",
