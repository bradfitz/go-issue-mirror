	"body": "by **alex.vizor**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat does 'go version' print?\ngo version go1.2.1 linux/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nJust to \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/85oWtwZAq9\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/85oWtwZAq9\u003c/a\u003e and Run.\n\nWhat happened?\nEmbedded struct defines XMLName field with xml.Name type and with corresponding field\ntag. xml.Marshal ignores this XMLName field from embeded struct and outer tag is\ngenerated from object's struct type name.\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\nDocumentation for xml.Marshal says:\n- an anonymous struct field is handled as if the fields of its\n  value were part of the outer struct.\nSo I expected that XMLName of type xml.Name from embedded struct should be marshaled as\nxml tag name.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
