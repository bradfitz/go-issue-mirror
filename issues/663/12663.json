	"body": "`go vet` has an error in the way it validates the suffix on examples. Currently, the tool requires that suffixes are entirely lowercase. See: https://github.com/golang/tools/commit/a25a8d567b492f9a659e1e1838cc093d5bf278a0#diff-06f3d45de583663b5ce0fc789861061fR21\r\n\r\nThe [documentation for `testing`](http://godoc.org/testing) states only that\r\n\r\n\u003e The suffix must *start* with a lower-case letter.\r\n\r\nIn fact, `godoc` will translate the first character of the suffix to uppercase when building the html and leave the rest as is. Because of this, camelCase suffixes are the only way to have \"multi-word\" names for examples. The package examples in [`sort`](http://godoc.org/sort) are a good example of these. In fact, I believe that `sort` will fail `go vet` as is.\r\n\r\nI suggest changing the `isExampleSuffix` check to check only the first rune with [`unicode.IsLower`](http://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsLower).\r\n    ",
