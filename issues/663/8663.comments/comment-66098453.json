That means that we want the spec to try to\nclearly state which programs can be compiled and which can not.  The spec currently says\n\"It is an error to specify multiple elements with the same field name or constant key\nvalue.\"  That is easy to understand and implement in all compilers.  If we use a more\ncomplex spec here, it's harder for all compilers to implement it the same way.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **release-none**._",
