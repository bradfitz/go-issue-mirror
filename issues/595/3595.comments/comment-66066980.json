I don't.\n\nI do think we could do what I said in comment 5, though, not closing the connection,\njust doing a TCP write shutdown and a full close after some timeout.  We'll let the\nkernel's TCP read buffer fill up and stop acking new packets and hopefully the client\nhas read our HTTP response by the time we RST on them.\u003c/pre\u003e",
