	"title": "Proposal: Add time.Until() to the time package",
	"body": "I'd like to propose that a `time.Until(t time.Time) time.Duration` function be added to the time package to compliment the existing `Since()` shortcut. This would make writing expressions with an expiration time a bit more readable:\r\n\r\n    \u003c-After(time.Until(expirationTime))\r\n\r\nvs.\r\n\r\n    \u003c-After(expirationTime.Sub(time.Now()))\r\n\r\nWhile it's still fairly obvious what the second one does, it takes a little longer to recognize \"sub\" as subtraction than just seeing the symbol. Also keeping time expressions more or less readable as english is a nice benefit of having the until shortcut (as you can do with the existing since function).\r\n\r\nIf this accepted, I've got a CL [here](https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/20118/) for review.",
