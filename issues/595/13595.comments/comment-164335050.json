	"body": "The point of that change was to highlight the fact that the receiver section is no different from other parameter sections and that the receiver is indeed very much a parameter.\r\n\r\nThe simpler change would be to verbally state that that receiver cannot be variadic. But note that in the explanations for parameters it is very clearly stated that only the last parameter in a function (incl. methods) can be variadic, so this may not even be necessary. Note also that the grammar is not always expressing the accepted language exactly, for simplicity of exposure. Sometimes it's just easier to refer to an already known concept (parameters) and explain constraints verbally.\r\n\r\n",
