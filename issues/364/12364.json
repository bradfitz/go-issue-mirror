	"body": "In #12361, brad mentions that he didn't know the owner of\r\ncompress/gzip, I think this might be a problem worth fixing in\r\na more systematic way.\r\n\r\nA lot of open source software has a mechanism that\r\ndocument the owners (and potential reviewers) for each\r\ncomponent. For example, Chrome uses the OWNERS file to\r\nrecord such information.\r\n\r\nShould we adopt a similar scheme?\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n1. people contributing patches know exactly who to add as reviewer.\r\n2. gopherbot can automatically add /cc to a triaged issue. (see also\r\nhttps://golang.org/cl/13475 for background.)\r\n\r\nDisadvantages:\r\nwe need to populate the OWNERS file and decide whether it\r\nlives in each package directory or there is a global file. We also\r\nhave to keep the file up-to-date.\r\n\r\nWe can use git log to populate the OWNERS file with the two\r\nor three most frequent (or edited the most lines) authors for\r\neach package, and then manually edit as necessary.",
