I have gone back and checked what error is retuned from calling Parse in\nthis manor.  Nil is returned so your statement that t1 should be considered undefined is\nnot true, furthermore there is no quick way to check that t1 is not a valid time\nstructure.\n\nRegards,\nJeffrey Bolle\u003c/pre\u003e",
