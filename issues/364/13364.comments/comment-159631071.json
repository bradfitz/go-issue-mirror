Each one failed with\n\u003e this build ID issue. The place where this error first starts is the oldest\n\u003e version where I retried the build, not the commit where it was first could\n\u003e happen.\n\u003e\n\u003e The machine where this testing is done is running DragonFly-master, and\n\u003e was updated at the time the fix for bug #13146\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/13146\u003e was applied, which brought in\n\u003e gold as the default linker\n\u003e \u003chttp://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/commits/2015-November/458732.html\u003e\n\u003e .\n\u003e\n\u003e Running the same test as @kaey \u003chttps://github.com/kaey\u003e fails on the\n\u003e build machine. Setting LDVER=ld.bfd, which sets the default linker back to\n\u003e ld and re-running the test succeeds. So, each of those failed tests is\n\u003e running with gold as the default linker, and that's the cause for the\n\u003e failure rather than an individual commit.\n\u003e\n\u003e The readelf output between the old linker and the gold linker on a\n\u003e super-basic hello.c program on DragonFly is almost exactly the same, except\n\u003e the gold linker also outputs this:\n\u003e\n\u003e Displaying notes found at file offset 0x00000b04 with length 0x0000001c:\n\u003e   Owner                 Data size Description\n\u003e   GNU                  0x00000009 NT_GNU_GOLD_VERSION (gold version)\n\u003e     Version: gold 1.11\n\u003e\n\u003e I thought it might be similar to #12178\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/12178\u003e but the offset only puts it\n\u003e past the first 512 bytes, and I think anywhere in the first 16K is OK -\n\u003e unless the gold output is the issue.
