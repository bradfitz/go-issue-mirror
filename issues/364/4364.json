	"body": "by **agm@google.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Try to make sense of the time.Format (for time.Parse) documentation.\n2.\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nDocumentation states that the time formats are for a specific time. That is:\n\n   Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006\n   which is Unix time 1136243045\n\nHowever, this disagrees with the GNU date tool:\n\n   $ date --date=\u0026quot;Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006\u0026quot; +%s\n   1136239445\n\nA difference of an hour (1136239445 - 1136243045 = -3600).\n\nI was trying to use a \u0026quot;UTC\u0026quot; format \u0026quot;YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:dd\u0026quot;, and\nthought (based on this documentation) that I should supply the date string for the\ncanonical time (in UTC). It wasn't clear based on this discrepancy whether that time was:\n\n   \u0026quot;2006-01-02 22:04:05\u0026quot; (1136239445)\n\nor\n\n   \u0026quot;2006-01-02 23:04:05\u0026quot; (1136243045)\n\nIt turns out, the format I need is:\n\n   \u0026quot;2006-01-02 15:04:05\u0026quot;\n\nwhich seems to pretty much ignore the canonical time... I feel the documentation could\nbe more clear here. Thanks.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\nDocumentation from the golang website.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nLinux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
