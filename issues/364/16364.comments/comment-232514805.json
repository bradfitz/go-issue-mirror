	"body": "As far as I can see, the only difference between a loosely-ordered channel and an unbuffered channel would be that with a loosely-ordered channel it would be unpredictable whether the goroutine reading from the channel would be able to see memory writes done by the goroutine sending on the channel before the actual send.  My apologies if I misunderstand.\r\n\r\nFirst I would say that I think that would be very difficult to implement.  Any use of channels implies locking.  So (I think) you are suggesting that the channel implementation should be rewritten to use only relaxed memory reads and writes.\r\n\r\nSecond, my first reaction is that these would be very hard to use correctly.  C++ has many different kinds of atomic operations, and they are extremely hard for non-experts to use correctly.  We explicitly do not want to emulate that in Go.",
