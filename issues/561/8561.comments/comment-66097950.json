To clarify:\n\n- this is about type assertions to interface types, not conversions.\n- the spec doesn't mention the possibility of a static error, and does talk about\ndynamic types,\n   so gc is consistent with the spec and go/types is not.  Reassigning to gri.\n- we probably couldn't change this even if we want to due to the Go 1.1 compatibility\nguarantee (and I do want to, because the current behaviour is harmful since it creates\nlatent dynamic errors when changing one interface but not another.)\n- s/interface doesn't/interface/\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @griesemer._",
