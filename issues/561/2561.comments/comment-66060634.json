We have that problem in one other place - shift -\nand we added explicit language to let the context\ndetermine the type.  But this has been an incredibly\nrich source of bugs.  My inclination would be to drop\nthe idea of an ideal bool and say that any comparison\n- even comparison of constants - has plain type bool.\u003c/pre\u003e",
