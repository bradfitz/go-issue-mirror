	"body": "I am currently attempting to use Golang v1.6 to interact with a 3rd party WS API.\r\n\r\nCurrently, they have a very limited set of supported ciphers:\r\n\r\n\u003e - TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256\r\n- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256\r\n- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256\r\n\r\nUnfortunately none of these overlap with supported Go's supported ciphers. Therefore I just get an 'EOF' response currently. \r\n\r\nPutting it out on the golang-nuts mailing list, I got a response from [Phus Lu](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/8sS9AXWfj-M/a40rs5LZAQAJ) which included a [commit](https://github.com/phuslu/go/commit/353372383f5bf452d3ca4a9425919cc423eb7e97) that adds the following ciphers:\r\n\r\n\u003e - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256\r\n- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256\r\n- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256\r\n\r\nIs there appetite to add support for these cipher suites to core?\r\n",
