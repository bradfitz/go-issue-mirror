	"body": "Was playing around manually modifying the Table in one package and was surprised to find out that it causes CRC32 errors in another package.\r\n\r\nThe name ```MakeTable``` seems to indicate that a unique table will be created and returned. But for the IEEE and Castagnoli polynomials specifically, it returns a reference to tables held globally. This has the following consequences:\r\n * Modifying a table returned by MakeTable(IEEE), may or may not cause all CRCs that use the IEEE polynomial to be incorrect. [This is because there are special cases where it uses a special iEEETable8 if the input table is a pointer match to IEEETable](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/1e0760354c8a929d9d84575106ae264fa6395132/src/hash/crc32/crc32.go#L155).\r\n\r\n* Modifying a table returned by MakeTable(Castagnoli) may or may not cause other Castagnoli polynomials to be wrong. [This is because if the input table is a pointer match to castagnoliTable and the hardware support CRC instructions, it will use the built in instructions or table.](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/1e0760354c8a929d9d84575106ae264fa6395132/src/hash/crc32/crc32.go#L151) Either way, the behavior is very confusing.\r\n\r\n* Modifying a table returned by MakeTable for any other polynomial works as expected.\r\n\r\nSee https://play.golang.org/p/IWehs0lQAc",
