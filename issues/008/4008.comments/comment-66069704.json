This is not a benchmarking issue,\nit just happens to be testing a function that has a fixed time envelope. I think your\ncomments about benchmarking are valuable, and echo comments from the 'profiling go\nprograms' blog post, but maybe they should go in a Wiki page. \n\nWith respect to this ticket, if there is little support for this devious and disgusting\nworkaround, maybe the test should be skipped on arm, or at least only enabled\nconditionally.\u003c/pre\u003e",
