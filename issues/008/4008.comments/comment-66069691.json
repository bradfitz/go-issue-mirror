(i think it all threads are sleeping, the CPU might enter\nlow power mode which will take quite some time to wakeup)\n\non my builder, after i switched to userspace cpufreq governor, this problem\ndisappeared for quite some time.\n(my userspace governor simply change frequency by measuring temperature,\nand it will try hard to maintain at least 700MHz, as cpu frequency lower than\nthat has much higher probability to fail this test)\u003c/pre\u003e",
