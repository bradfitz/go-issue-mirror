You probably agree, since you filed\nthis bug.\n\nThere is a tradeoff between skipping tests on unreliable platforms and missing bugs, and\nhaving to deal with noise from spurious test failures.\n\nThere's also the question of whether it's the platform or the test itself that is\nunreliable.\n\nI guess this clever trick tries to fix the test without changing the platform. I think\nmy suggestion is: skip the test if you can reliably detect that the platform is\nunreliable.\n\nThe clever trick fails if the platform is more unreliable than it anticipates.\n\nThe skip approach fails if and when it misses a bug.\n\nFinally, to figure out if this specific clever trick is good enough at preventing\nspurious failures, you probably have to send it out into the wild to face a hoard of\nlinux/arm systems for a few months.\n\nAll that being said, I think both approaches have about equal merit. Good luck. :-)\u003c/pre\u003e",
