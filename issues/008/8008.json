	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIn path/filepath/match.go, there two cases where os.Stat and os.Lstat are used, in which\nany non-nil error is just dropped and the filename in question is skipped as if it\ndoesn't exist. However the error returned by those calls may not be ErrNotExist; it may\nindicate any number of other possible problems, which should be reported back to the\ncaller of os.Glob rather than being silently dropped. This is easy to fix by replacing\n\u0026quot;err != nil\u0026quot; with \u0026quot;os.IsNotExist(err)\u0026quot; in the two relevant spots;\nnear the top of \u0026quot;Glob\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;glob\u0026quot; in match.go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
