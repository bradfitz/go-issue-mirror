If you were spinning off several goroutines you \nare free to ignore the resultant channel, and the compiler can optimise it away.\n\nI like the idea from comment 1 -- the type of the channel is the return type of the \nfunction being called, defaulting to chan int if there's no return type. There's the\ngotcha \nthat functions can have multiple return values, so they would probably also have to \ndefault to a chan int.\u003c/pre\u003e",
