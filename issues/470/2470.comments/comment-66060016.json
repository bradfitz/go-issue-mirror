The C spec is super vague about the concrete\ntype of an enum type, but often the compiler picks int, and in this case,\non OpenBSD/386, the defined value is negative if interpreted as an int.\n\nThere are many things we could do but the easiest is probably to\nstop using the enum values entirely.  Cgo already has code to\ngenerate a long long array with the values and then read the\nvalues out of the object file directly for Mach-O.  This was necessary\nfor Apple's latest LLVM-based gcc implementations, which have\ntaken an axe to the amount of useful DWARF information they\nleave in the object.  If we make the ELF systems read that array\ntoo, then it might all just work.\n\nWant to give it a try, Mikio?\u003c/pre\u003e",
