That should ensure that that goroutine will always see the correct TLS values.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can't see a compelling reason to penalize all Go programs that use os/user in order to work around a glibc bug that only occurs when linking with -static.  Since you want to use -static, I'm going to have to recommend that use that workaround yourself: make all your calls to os/user.Lookup from a single goroutine that calls runtime.LockOSThread.  You can drop that workaround when you get a fixed version of glibc.",
