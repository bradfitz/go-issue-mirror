	"body": "by **Matthew.Horsnell**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n1. open a file using \u0026quot;debug/elf\u0026quot;:\n\nfile := elf.Open(filename)\n\n2. it is possible to get most elf header attributes from the file, but the entry point\nis *not* exposed to the \u0026quot;debug/elf\u0026quot; type File.\n\n3. It might be useful to know the entry point, for example in emulators.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nn/a\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nn/a\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nany\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nany\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo1\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nthis is trivial to fix; the entry point is read into the Header32/Header64 structure, it\njust isn't exposed in the public facing File type in debug/elf.\u003c/pre\u003e",
