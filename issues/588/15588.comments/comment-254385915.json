Could you try my instructions https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15588#issuecomment-253391436 and check if you see any improvements?\r\n\r\n\u003e One idea to figure this out is to use a debugger to determine whether shell32 is getting loaded during process run before and after the change.\r\n\r\nHow would I do that?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAlex",
