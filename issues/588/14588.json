	"body": "This issue makes TestDriveLetterInEvalSymlinks fails in some path configuration from at least Go 1.4 up to Go 1.6. The problem exists only on windows.\r\n\r\nMy current setup has go installed at the location G:\\\\.go\\. When running all.bash, the test TestDriveLetterInEvalSymlinks will fail with this result:\r\n\u003e --- FAIL: TestDriveLetterInEvalSymlinks (0.00s)\r\n\u003e path_test.go:1200: Results of EvalSymlinks do not match: \"G:\\\\.go\\\\src\\\\path\\\\filepath\" and \"G:\\\\.GO\\\\src\\\\path\\\\filepath\"\r\n\r\nI tracked down the issue to the case-correcting procedure in symlink_windows.go. It seems that Windows's GetLongPathName will not correct the casing of a folder if it starts with a period.\r\n\r\nThe issue seem to be on Windows side and not on Go's. But it makes all.bat fail when someone's GOROOT has a folder starting with a dot in it so I prefered to make an issue for it.",
