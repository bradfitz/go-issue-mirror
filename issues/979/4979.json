I have seen the problem only under\nFreeBSD; I haven't gotten any complaints from people who are testing it on Linux. I saw\nthat it was consuming more system time than user time, so I could tell that it was doing\nsome syscalls; I decided to try to trace it with ktrace. The result is an endless\nalternation of sched_yield and _umtx_op calls:\n\n 21045 redwood  CALL  sched_yield\n 21045 redwood  RET   sched_yield 0\n 21045 redwood  CALL  _umtx_op(0xc210c8cc20,0x2,0x2,0,0)\n 21045 redwood  RET   _umtx_op 0\n 21045 redwood  CALL  sched_yield\n 21045 redwood  RET   sched_yield 0\n 21045 redwood  CALL  _umtx_op(0xc210c8cc20,0x2,0x2,0,0)\n 21045 redwood  RET   _umtx_op 0\n\n# uname -a\nFreeBSD balholm.com 9.1-PRERELEASE FreeBSD 9.1-PRERELEASE #2 r244360M: Fri Dec 28\n20:12:01 PST 2012     root@balholm.com:/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/GENERIC  amd64\n\n$ go version\ngo version devel +677c9ac552ac Sun Mar 03 08:56:08 2013 +1100 darwin/amd64\n\n(Yes, I am cross-compiling on a Mac.)\n\nThis appears to be a regression; I didn't have this problem till about a week ago.\u003c/pre\u003e",
