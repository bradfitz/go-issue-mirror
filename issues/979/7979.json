	"body": "by **garrett@damore.org**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe documentation for tcp.SetLinger() says;\n\nIf sec \u0026lt; 0 (the default), Close returns immediately and the operating system finishes\nsending the data in the background.\n\nThis seems to make a promise which is rarely true.  Indeed, it seems that the\nexpectation is that if the operating system supports this it works, but the operating\nsystems I've seen don't do this.\n\nInstead, the Close() behavior seems to be that the operating system may discard unset\ndata.  And indeed that's what I've seen.  I recommend the wording be changed to say:\n\nIf sec \u0026lt; 0; Close returns immediately.  The operating system may attempt to continue\nto send data in the background, or the unset or unacknowledged data may be discarded.\u003c/pre\u003e",
