The configuration is\nproprietary, but I will share it for debugging purposes. The configuration directory\n(attached) should be extracted as /etc/redwood. \n\nI am not including my SSL certificates, so you'll need to create new ones. Put them at\nthe paths specified in redwood.conf, on the tls-cert and tls-key lines (or change those\nlines to point to your certificates). Import your SSL certificates into your browser as\ntrusted roots.\n\nCreate the /var/log/redwood directory.\n\nRun redwood. Set your browser's HTTP and HTTPS proxies to {{the server where you're\nrunning redwood}}:6502. Browse around on the web. Many sites will be inaccessible;\nthat's the point of the program. When you run into a blocked site, just try something\nelse. Most sites related to programming should be available.\n\nThe heavier the load the server is under, the more likely it is to crash. My crash this\nmorning happened while I was running portupgrade -a.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4979/45/redwood.zip\"\u003eredwood.zip\u003c/a\u003e (548000 bytes)",
