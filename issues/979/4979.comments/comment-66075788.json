It's a nil pointer dereference\nwhere there clearly can't be one if everything is working properly. The crash is\noccurring in the line z[0] = x of the following function in math/big/nat.go:\n\nfunc (z nat) setWord(x Word) nat {\n\tif x == 0 {\n\t\treturn z.make(0)\n\t}\n\tz = z.make(1)\n\tz[0] = x\n\treturn z\n}\n\nThe previous line ensures that z has at least one element.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4979/28/crash%20Mar%2030%200943.txt\"\u003ecrash Mar 30 0943.txt\u003c/a\u003e (22938 bytes)",
