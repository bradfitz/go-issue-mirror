(run 'go version')\n\ngo version go1.0.2 +2d8bc3c94ecb\n(from \u003ca href=\"http://ppa.launchpad.net/gophers/go/ubuntu/)\"\u003ehttp://ppa.launchpad.net/gophers/go/ubuntu/)\u003c/a\u003e\nJudged by the hg revision this seems to be go 1.0.3 even though the version string still\nsays 1.0.2.\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\n1. The problem depends on the size of fragment_size in the example program. Up to a\ncertain size everything is fine, the memory usage stabilizes. But once it exceeds the\nsafe number there is unlimited growth.\n\n2. I came upon this problem while examining why our server application keeps crashing\nwith out of memory. In that application the problem occurs when the String() function on\nlarge (about 20MB) bytes.Buffer objects is called repeatedly. Either the strings or the\nbuffers or both never get freed even after references to both have been dropped.\n\n3. The problem does not occur with golang-tip from the gophers PPA, but I don't know if\nthis is because of an actual fix in the GC or because the optimizer optimizes away some\nof the useless code. I cannot test golang-tip with our actual server application because\ngolang-tip is still too buggy (The application compiles but doesn't pass the regression\ntest suite).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5109/0/testgarbage.go\"\u003etestgarbage.go\u003c/a\u003e (731 bytes)",
