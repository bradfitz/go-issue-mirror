If the local changes are compatible, the operation\nsucceeds, and the file remains changed. If they are not compatible, I get this message:\n\n$ git checkout origin/release\nerror: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:\n        skygen/skygen.go\nPlease, commit your changes or stash them before you can switch branches.\n\nThat's exactly what I want to see, since I changed a file locally that was also changed\nin the repo. The merge would fail too. I'd be more concerned about furtive merges that\ndo *not* fail.\u003c/pre\u003e",
