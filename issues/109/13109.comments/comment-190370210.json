	"body": "Sorry for the delay.\r\n\r\nIt sounds reasonable to me to make gomobile init take care of downloading. x/mobile/cmd/gomobile/release.go is the code that prepares archives that are downloaded by the gomobile init command. It also generates fetchHashes found in hashes.go. To make the release\r\nprocess easier, please put the code for building packed.arsc.gz in the release.go. Once done, we can make the file available for download.\r\n\r\nRe: use of minAndroidAPI and androidAPIPath of 'gomobile bind' is used only to pick the android.jar file needed to run javac and androidAPIPath just searches the ANDROID_HOME directory to find any target platform that satisfies minAndroidAPI requirement. gomobile bind itself doesn't deal with binary resources directly, so I doubt the binres package is relevant. \r\n\r\nRe: temporary flag. I'd like to avoid any flag if possible. We can try to communicate with current users to test it (via golang-dev or golang-nuts or forum) if there is a chance of breaking the current usage. Or, like useStrippedNDK (in init.go), we can keep the old code for a while during migration and guide users to utilize that if necessary.",
