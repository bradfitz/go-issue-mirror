Once this is done, things should be working.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of TODOs I'll be reviewing in the source and I may refactor a few things. Aside from this, I have the following concerns with moving forward.\r\n\r\n* How will packed.arsc.gz be distributed? (this is the stripped down resources from android.jar used for validation of attributes and values, currently 63KB)\r\n* Do we want to add a temporary flag to cmd gomobile for using this method to handle manifests? This may allow feedback from any current users before migrating.\r\n* should any current functionality related to android that exists elsewhere make its way into the package? In bind tool, see minAndroidAPI, androidAPIPath(), which are relevant to binres functioning as intended.\r\n* What current issues warrant the need for exports in the package? Right now I suspect providing an app icon may depend on generating a resource table in the apk, pending further investigation. All that's necessary to have exported for encoding manifest is `binres.UnmarshalXML` and `binres.XML`. Or, do we want to leave some slack since this is an internal package?",
