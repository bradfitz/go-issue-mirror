It seems like it should be the case that:\r\n\r\ntime.Parse(time.RFC1123,  time.RFC1123).Unix() == 1136239445\r\n\r\n(this is missing error checking, etc -- see the play for a working example). The MST seems to not be parsed properly (oddly it makes it into the resulting time object from Parse() and gets displayed ,but the offset doesn't seem to be applied). Note that some time formats (those with numeric offsets) do work.\r\n\r\ntime.Parse(time.RFC1123Z,  time.RFC1123Z).Unix() == 1136239445\r\n\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/FGdOKMwznE",
