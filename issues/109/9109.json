All other spaces are still there.\n\nHowever, for the \u0026quot;want\u0026quot; output, only the leading spaces of the second and\nthird lines are there. All other spaces were removed (including all the trailing spaces\n-- maybe the parser is removing all trailing spaces from comments).\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nThe documentation says: \u0026quot;The comparison ignores leading and trailing space.\u0026quot;\n\nIt doesn't say the spaces are ignored for each line, but I think it makes more sense to\ntrim leading and trailing spaces for each line. At least it should be consistent about\nhow it's removing the spaces.\u003c/pre\u003e",
