Randomization is used to avoid correlation with the user application, so common multiples shouldn't be a factor. The current code is in https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/malloc.go#L791\r\n\r\nSome variation is expected due to sampling, but the current results showing some allocations not being sampled at all, and others reported at 1700X is a bug.\r\n",
