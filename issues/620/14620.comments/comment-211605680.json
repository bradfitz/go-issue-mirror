	"body": "The problem is that when typechecking a pointer to a named type like `*msg`, cmd/compile recurses and tries to completely typecheck `msg`.  Instead, we should just do the minimum to get a `*Type` value for `msg` (in this case a `TFORW` type) so we can construct the `*msg` pointer type.  Later when we visit `msg`'s type declaration, we can finish typechecking it.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to move the `hdr` type declaration after the `msg` type declaration.",
