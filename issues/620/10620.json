	"body": "Context: /list\r\n\r\nUnder basics, flow control statement, it currently lists \"for, if, else, and switch.\" I recommend adding \"defer\" to the list. Defer is the last section of flow control statements. It is also the most interesting and unique one of this section.\r\n\r\nIt will give readers a better idea of what's in the section, and can help them decide whether they want to read or skip this tutorial better, as well as where to find \"defer\" if they want to come back to the tutorial again.",
