	"body": "Something that has come to trouble me about this: channels are level-triggered.  A channel has a value or it does not, and values do not disappear until somebody reads them.\r\n\r\nCondition variables are edge-triggered.  A call to the `Signal` method is a trigger that wakes up anything that is waiting right now.  If nothing is waiting, nothing happens.\r\n\r\nIf we turn an edge-triggered mechanism into a level-triggered mechanism, then we either do something laborious to drain the level (read the value from the channel) if nothing needs it, or we have too many triggers.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly obvious when we consider the `Broadcast` method.  The `Broadcast` method is easy to understand in terms of edge-triggering: everything that is waiting right now is alerted.  Implementing that was level-triggering, without race conditions, is much more complex.  Do we wake all select statements waiting on the channel right now? What value do we hand them?\r\n\r\nThe select statement, unlike channels, can be either edge-triggered or level-triggered.  It would be meaningful to design some way to attach an edge trigger to a select statement.  It just wouldn't go through a channel.\r\n\r\nSo I think this is a fairly subtle change.",
