What I found is that when I turn on encoding/gob/debug.go, and then call Debug(bytes.NewReader(\"...the hex...\")) the variable numFields in debug.go gets set to a too big number, undoubtedly due to the corrupted gob input.\r\n\r\nI have not yet worked backwards to find out if there's a way that gob can tell that the number of fields it is being asked to keep track of is too big.",
