You can see the\nerror in 'go list -json sample.go', and go run should report it.  Perhaps it is ignoring\nit because it appears in DepsErrors and not in Error.  Fixing this alone would fix the\nproblem, making go run print the same error that go build does.\n\n2. Because 'go run' ignores the errors, it actually tries to build the fictitious\nsql/database/driver package, and the build succeeds in creating an empty .a file.  The\nexistence of this .a file that keeps 6g from reporting the invalid import and instead\ncauses the other two errors.  You can see the build in the output of 'go run -x\nsample.go'.  Any build of a package with no .go files should fail.  (It should never\nhappen but it should still fail.)\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-soon**, **go1.1**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
