If the code never\nexecutes, you've taken a working program and made it a non-compiling program.\n\nThe fact that gccgo rejects the program already pushes me a little in that direction,\nbut I'm still wary.\n\nI feel like this has come up before but I cannot find the discussion. At the least we\nshould leave a \u0026lt;!-- --\u0026gt; comment in the spec this time.\n\nI suggest putting this off until 1.4.\u003c/pre\u003e",
