	"body": "For the record, https://2b01:e34:ef40:7730:8e70:5aff:fefe:edac:/foo is NOT a well-formed IPv6 URL. The [ ] around the IPv6 address are not optional. If browsers accept that, consider yourself lucky.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, net/url makes no attempt to parse the host in the URL. The exception is IPv6 literals, although I am not sure why we bother to check them so carefully. Maybe because they are just one giant exception to all the rules.\r\n\r\nIn any event, the grammar in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#page-22 seems to suggest that port can be an empty string even when a colon is present, so I'll make that change in the IPv6 literal parsing.",
