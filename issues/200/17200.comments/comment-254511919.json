Am I understanding correctly that you're saying that Apple might change how one dynamically links a Mach-O binary to a library? I don't think that really happens much, as the format hasn't changed in years and is publicly documented (including by Apple themselves, although I can't find the page anymore ðŸ˜®). The only compatibility-breaking changes I know of are that since 10.11, they stopped respecting custom `dyld` interpreter requests, and they've added a few oddball load commands over the past few years that might prevent binaries using them from running on older systems.\r\n\r\nDynamically linking against libSystem (Apple's recommended route) seems substantially different from writing your own syscall wrappers, which Apple has explicitly documented to be unsupported and dangerous behavior. It's not ideal to depend on Xcode, but writing a linker that knows how to dynamically link exactly one thing (with a well specified format) seems like an easier task than maintaining a mass of syscall wrappers that Apple has said they'll probably break over time.",
