There is nothing at all that constrains Apple from changing things so that linking on version N requires an algorithm different than linking on version N-1.  They aren't constrained by documentation or compatibility or tooling, they are only constrained by ensuring that programs linked on version N-1 continue to run on version N.  That means that things will inevitably change, because there is nothing that will prevent it.",
