	"body": "By 'out of scope for Go 1.x', do you mean that it would break the Go 1 compatibility guarantee, or just that it can't make it into Go 1.7 because it's past the freeze? What I'm thinking of wouldn't break the guarantee, and I certainly don't expect changes now to make it into Go 1.7.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I'm picturing a new function, probably in the `httptest` package, with a signature along the following lines:\r\n\r\n    func PipeNetwork(addr string, next func(net, addr string) (net.Conn, error)) (net.Listener, func(net, addr string) (net.Conn, error))\r\n\r\nIt would be used like this:\r\n\r\n    lis, dial := PipeNetwork(DefaultRemoteAddr, net.Dial)\r\n\r\n    s := httptest.NewUnstartedServer(someHandler)\r\n    s.Listener = lis\r\n    s.Start()\r\n\r\n    c := \u0026http.Client{Transport: \u0026http.Transport{Dial: dial}}\r\n\r\nBasically, calls to `dial` where the `addr` parameter matched the `addr` parameter given to `PipeNetwork` would use `net.Pipe` and connect to the returned `net.Listener`, while other addresses would be passed through to the provided `next` function.",
