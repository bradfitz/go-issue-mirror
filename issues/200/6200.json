	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eAndrew,\n\nThe godoc bake tool needs to put the baked file in its own package.\n\ntip.golang.org (currently broken and ugly) is its own binary and needs access to the\nbaked files.\n\nThey shouldn't be in cmd/godoc.\n\nThe point of the godoc split was to make more smaller packages.  Putting more crap into\ncmd/godoc is antithetical with that goal.\n\nI'd just bake them into cmd/godoc/template (the directory already exists).\n\nMove bake.sh too, and then just make it be like:\n\ngo run bake.go $(ls -1 | grep -v go$) | gofmt \u0026gt; template.go.\n\nAlso, the map needs to be exported.\u003c/pre\u003e",
