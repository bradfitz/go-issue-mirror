For example, I\nhave a sort of minimal IDE that can build stuff using various tools (make, waf, etc). It\nshows stderr in red so it's easy to spot errors and it greps stderr to automatically\ngoto error locations generated by various tools (usually compilers).\n\nNeither of these work well with go: errors are not in red and errors don't go to stderr\nso I have to grovel through *all* of the output of make just to find go errors. I'd\nrather not remember all of stdout just to find go errors...\n\nFor now I'm being really lame and if a stdout line includes \".go:\" I append it to the\nstderr results I grovel through.\u003c/pre\u003e",
