Also the code already casts (new|old)(len|cap) to uintptr in a few places and newarray also takes a uintptr.\r\n\r\nInt would have the benefit that the slice header uses int for cap and len and that are likely to be the most used argument types.\r\n\r\nIn any case we need to either check cap \u003c 0 for int or cap \u003e maxint for uintptr.\r\n\r\nI would be in favor to use uintptr.",
