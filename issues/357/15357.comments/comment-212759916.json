We already check len \u003c 0 in makeslice so passing in a uint/uintptr instead of int that is to large should be caught already. As for uint64/int64 there needs to be a wrapper on 32bit platforms as ianlancetaylor pointed out. \r\nIt also seems a better fit with the internals to use int since we changed newarray to take int now (even if it is not used by makeslice anymore).",
