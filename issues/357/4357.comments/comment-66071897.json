In that regard, please note that time.Time.IsZero disregards the loc\nfield, which means the outcome of omitempty would disagree with the result of IsZero,\nleading to potential confusion.\n\nPutting that aside, I've supported omitempty with the zero-struct check in other\npackages (bson, etc), and the outcome was positive.\u003c/pre\u003e",
