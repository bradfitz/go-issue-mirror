However after modifying the command to:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -v \\\r\n  --tlsv1.2 \\\r\n  --ciphers ecdhe_rsa_aes_128_sha \\\r\n  --cacert /home/nifi/robtest/nexusproxy/guard_ca.pem \\\r\n  --cert /path/to/public_crt.pem \\\r\n  --key /path/to/private_key.pem https://some.server.com:8000/some/path \\\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's still connecting, but with a supported cipher this time. That's not to say it still couldn't be an issue of curl doing something automagically for me (I guess since it works, that's pretty likely).\r\n\r\nSince opening the issue I've learned that this is what's running on the other side:\r\n\r\nhttps://nifi.apache.org/index.html\r\n\r\nI'm trying to get more information on configuration, but at least I might have a chance of getting something running to test against now.",
