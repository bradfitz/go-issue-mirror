It only took me a few minutes to modify crypto/tls and find the line that was returning the error. I was just thrown off by the section in conn.go that I referenced above - but bradfitz cleared that up.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce this on my own - that is I couldn't get a test case (with my own server) where the go client failed and curl succeeded (they either both succeeded or both failed) so this seems to be some weird edge case. Unfortunately I'm unable to find out anything more about the third party server that would help.\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, I feel like the issue is resolved as well as it can be, although I can see how a more precise error message could help in some cases.",
