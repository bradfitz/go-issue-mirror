	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThis is the first of a few bugs to track test flakiness and get it fixed.\n\nEven on a reasonably reliable 10 Mbps DSL internet connection, tests that touch the\nexternal network fail from time to time.\n\nExample:\n\n--- FAIL: TestDialGoogleIPv4 (10.03 seconds)\ndialgoogle_test.go:66: lookup www.google.com: lookup www.google.com: no such host\n\nThis leads to a constant stream of failures that have to be triaged (a few per day).\n\nThese tests need to be skipped based on an environment variable (or something) so that\nno matter if they're run through \u0026quot;go test\u0026quot;, run.bash, etc., they can easily be\nskipped.\n\nEveryone else running go test net and make.bash are constantly testing these.\u003c/pre\u003e",
