	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe root update on 3/11/2014 removed the Verisign root cert that the Go tests use. This\nonly affects the 'TestSystemVerify' test in crypto/x509. I fixed the windows-amd64\nbuilder by manually adding the certificate back to Windows using the instructions at\n[1], except that I had to explicitly change the cert from 'Code Signing' to 'Verifying\nServers'.\n\nagl says that the tests need to be updated, but it's a little non-trivial. For now the\ncrypto/x509 test will fail except on the builder. If that's a problem we can disable the\ntest, but I'd like to keep it if we can.\n\n[1] \u003ca href=\"http://www.sqlservermart.com/HowTo/Windows_Import_Certificate.aspx\"\u003ehttp://www.sqlservermart.com/HowTo/Windows_Import_Certificate.aspx\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
