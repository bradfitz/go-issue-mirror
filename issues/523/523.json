What do you see instead?\n\npkg1.go:11: Id redeclared in this block\n\tprevious declaration at pkg2.go:13\n\nLine 13 of pkg2.go is the import of pkg1\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n\ndarwin, amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\nf467eb7716c4+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nMy packages are organized in separate directories using the makefile \nstructure suggested in the GO documentation.\u003c/pre\u003e",
