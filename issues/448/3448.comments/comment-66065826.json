That's not Go code: it's the dynamic linker.\nThat explains why the Go runtime did not get a chance to print a nice\ntraceback: it's not running at all.\n\nIf you run 'env | grep DY' does it find any variables?\n\nFor what it's worth, sw_vers on my Mac says version 10.7.3\n(like yours) but build version 11D50b (not 11D50 like yours).\nI don't know if that matters at all, but if there is a minor update\nthat Apple wants to install on your Mac it might be worth trying,\nespecially if you don't have any DY environment variables set.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
