	"body": "I think it's fine to make the newly added methods of Resolver in Go 1.8 more deterministic and configurable for people who want to use Lookup APIs deterministically such as telco operators, but am not keen to change the default \"non-deterministic\" behavior because IP infrastructure consumers usually don't take care with details of underlying stuff, they care about only the returned error value and result.\r\n\r\nFortunately we've not seen reports like \"exchanging multiple different RRs on multiple DNS transports is inefficient\" or \"exchanging multiple different RRs on a single DNS transport makes some L4-7 appliance malfunction\" yet. Maybe it's a good timing to start improving the existing builtin DNS stub resolver, though I guess it requires some blueprint.",
