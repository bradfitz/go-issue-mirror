	"body": "What version of Go are you using (go version)? *1.5.1*\r\nWhat operating system and processor architecture are you using? *Ubuntu Intel 64 bits*\r\nWhat did you do? *use mime.ParseMediaType*\r\nWhat did you expect to see? *error mime: invalid media parameter*\r\nWhat did you see instead? *no error or different type of error*\r\n\r\nThe following is actually output from bad email client for an attachment mime header:\r\n\u003e Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name=Viktoria C\r\n\u003e Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=Viktoria C\r\n\r\nThis type of header email will output \"mime: invalid media parameter\" error under golang. But the same email when open/parse by Thunderbird and other C email library will give the attachment with file name *Viktoria* instead of *Viktoria C*.\r\n\r\nI understand the main problem is the bad email client and not golang library but the same mail can be opened with other application which is not using Golang library may give the wrong perspective that Golang library capability - the fact is Golang error handling too good that expose those scapegoat buggy software problem. But just because of this tiny error the whole email can not be parsed.\r\n\r\nMay be Golang library can have something as [this](https://github.com/cention-sany/mime/blob/master/mediatype.go#L139) to discriminate certain error that can be recovered.",
