It booted, but the stage0.exe was gone. It must've failed and died.  I don't know why, but maybe networking wasn't fully up yet?  It should loop a few times with a sleep.\r\n\r\nThen we should rebuild the Windows image too with a 40 GB base instead of a 100 GB base. (since we'll have to rebuild anyway to update stage0, and 40 GB is now available I hear, whereas only 100 GB was available before)\r\n\r\n/cc @adg ",
