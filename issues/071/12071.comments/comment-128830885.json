For some reason I appear to subconsciously interpret \"Close and comment\" as \"Cancel\" I think.\r\n\r\n(It's really a bad UI layout. Close should be red, and not the biggest button right next to \"Comment\").\r\n\r\nBut now that I'm here:\r\n\r\nI 100% agree with Alan Donovan's sentiment. Probably the single-biggest useful feature of the \"C1\" (client) compiler in the Java HotSpot VM (written back in the day) was the relatively \"pretty\" and easy-to-read output of the intermediate representation. It was (basic) block-by-block, with one line for each \"instruction\". The original code was not based on SSA but had an SSA-like format. The one major piece of code that survived from that time (almost 20yrs back!), even after they transitioned to SSA intermediate representation, is the code printing that output. So, yes, great, _readable_ output for intermediate representation pays over time.",
