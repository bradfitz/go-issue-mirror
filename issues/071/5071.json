	"body": "by **jessevdk**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI was working with spawning a lot of processes that didn't exist from a number of\ngoroutines. For these processes I was opening pipes for stdin, stdout and stderr. After\nsome point my process always got errors like \u0026quot;pipe: too many open files\u0026quot;.\n\nI quickly went through the sources and it seems that when LookupPath fails, and\ncmd.Start is called, the open ends of the pipes associated to the command are not closed\nat that time.\n\nInitially I found it hard to reproduce the bug because when the GC gets time to run, it\nwill call the finalizers of the open files which end up closing the pipes. However, with\nenough go routines running at the same time (which I had in my original program) the\nproblem can be reproduced quite easily.\n\nI've attached a small pipebug.go file which demonstrates the problem.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5071/0/pipebug.go\"\u003epipebug.go\u003c/a\u003e (614 bytes)",
