We'd probably want something like:\n  var Signal = make(map[int] chan int)\n\nThat way you could wait for just the particular signal(s) you want, so you could have \na goroutine running a function looking like:\n  func signalWatcher() {\n    \u0026lt;-os.Signal[syscall.SIGHUP];  // wait for hangup signal\n    // do some clean up\n  }\n\nAnother approach would be a registry similar to what's found in the 'rpc' or 'http' \npackage where you'd pass a function that you want called when a particular signal \narrives. This more closely follows the traditional signal() C syscall.\u003c/pre\u003e",
