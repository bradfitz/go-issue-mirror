Does anyone have a reliable repro?\r\n\r\nHuh, @hakim's logs says \"main.draw(0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\" which suggests that the app was sent a 0-width 0-height configuration, which looks suspicious. @hakim, do you know if your logs were before or after https://go-review.googlesource.com/11668 landed, which removed the freetype code from DrawFPS?\r\n\r\nPossibly related, or possibly separate, it's OK to pass a nil slice as the final arg to gl.TexImage2D but not for gl.TexSubImage2D, and the latter will panic on \"\u0026data[0]\". Perhaps @crawshaw would know whether it's meaningful for TexSubImage2D (or indeed any other gl function like BufferData or ReadPixels) to be able to take an empty slice.",
