The same allocation is not (at least conceptually) possible with glTextSubImage2D, so I believe passing in nil data is an error. It's also not documented as supported.\r\n\r\nThese particular functions get more complex in OpenGL ES 3. If a buffer is bound to GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER, then the GLvoid* data is not treated as a pointer. Instead, it is a byte offset. So a zero value for the C data value makes sense for glTexSubImage2D, but the Go []byte is inadequate. It's really impressive how many ways these functions get overloaded.",
