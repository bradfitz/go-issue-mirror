I wanted to find out about a detail of encoding/gob and\ninstead I got distracting log messages. That's why I filed this issue. It is nice that\nthe example was fixed, but what if we shipped Go 1.2 with this? Fixing it would\ncertainly not rise to the level we have set for issuing point releases in the new faster\nmodel. Would we really want everyone who ever wants to lookup something about\nencoding/gob using godoc to be told about this inconsequential example for the next six\nmonths?\u003c/pre\u003e",
