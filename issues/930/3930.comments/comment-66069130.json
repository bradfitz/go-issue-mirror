I'd like this service to be usable by as many as possible\nwithout complicated SSL configuration.\n\nI'm not aware of any existing SMTP proxy that I can use like Nginx or HAProxy to be a\nSMTP front-end, only store \u0026 forward type SMTP servers, which I'd rather not use.\n\nI understand that the TLS implementation isn't as well-reviewed as OpenSSL, but what\nincentive do people have to do that as long as the answer is always to put it behind\nOpenSSL?\n\nAnyway, I understand if the answer is no, it's a limited use case that will eventually\nbe a non-issue, it just seemed worthwhile to improve interop in the short term.  I can\njust keep on using my patched version. :)\u003c/pre\u003e",
