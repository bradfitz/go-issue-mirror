I think that would be safer than expecting developers to patch the Go source, which may be a necessity for some.\r\n\r\nIf `crypto/tls` really isn't \"production ready\", the documentation should make it much clearer - I only found this bug after trying to connect to the Go server using `openssl s_client`!",
