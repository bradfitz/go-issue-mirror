I don't\nlike its design and that it's too intertwined with the build dashboard's code and data.\nThey should be separate apps.\n\nIf you'd like to redeploy a fresh instance of the perf dashboard to a different\ngolang.org subdomain, I will arrange for a commit watcher to ping your instance of new\ncommits.\n\nBut I see Andrew took this in the meantime, so he can decide how much patience he has.\u003c/pre\u003e",
