After the patches, we can observe the behavior\nyou pointed out on FreeBSD 9-STABLE and 10, OS X Mavericks (that's likely because\nMavericks uses a part of FreeBSD 10 as its BSD subsystem), like the following:\n\nActive Internet connections (including servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)\ntcp4       0  65380 127.0.0.1.30213        127.0.0.1.58842        ESTABLISHED\ntcp46      0      0 *.58842                *.*                    LISTEN\n\na completely squeezed Recv-Q by specifying SO_RCVBUF option. IIRC, FreeBSD 9.2 and\nprior, OS X Mountain Lion and prior do extend Recv-Q even if we specify a very small\nSO_RCVBUF. Also we know that the behavior of SO_RCVBUF/SNDBUF options is really platform\nand protocol-dependent stuf. Seems there's nothing we can do for now (except adding\nplatform/protocol independent socket buffer management stuff into the\nnet/runtime/syscall packages).
