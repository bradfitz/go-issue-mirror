	"body": "It's delightful that `iostest.bash` wraps up everything needed to run `all.bash` on an iOS device. I was rather unpleasantly surprised, though, when the first thing it did was restart my phone.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is needed for dedicated builders, but for personal devices and manual runs, it's not super friendly and certainly unexpected. I'd suggest controlling this by an environment variable or some such.\r\n",
