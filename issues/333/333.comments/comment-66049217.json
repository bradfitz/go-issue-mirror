Among other things, the\nclient can't even store that pointer in a data structure\nbecause it cannot declare the data structure.  And the documentation\nwon't show up because it is an unexported type.\n\nIt's allowed because it's a consequence of the rules,\nand we like the rules.\n\nA more common approach, in this situation, is to define the\ninterface that the returned type implements (or pull it from\nsomewhere else), and completely hide the type name.\nPackage hash/crc32 and hash/adler32 do this: they have\nconstructors that return simply hash.Hash, which completely\nhides even what the underlying unexported type is called.\u003c/pre\u003e",
