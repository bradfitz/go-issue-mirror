	"body": "I don't see a simple fix for the general problem.  The go tool only wants to a single import path to denote a single package.  I can fix it so that `$GOPATH/src/vendor/golang.org/x/net/http2` works, because there is no such package in `$GOROOT`, but if `$GOPATH/src/vendor/golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack` exists, then this can't work, because `$GOPATH/src/vendor/golang.org/x/net/http2` will import it, and `$GOROOT/src/net/http` will import `$GOROOT/src/vendor/golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack`, and now we have two different packages with the import path `vendor/golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack`.  That should logically work, but it doesn't, and I think that fixing that is too risky for 1.7.\r\n\r\nThe only options I can see are to punt this to 1.8 as unfortunately broken in 1.7, or to move the `$GOROOT/src/vendor/golang.org` directory to `$GOROOT/src/internal` as we did in 1.6.\r\n\r\n@bradfitz Do you see anything else we can do?  Any preferences?",
