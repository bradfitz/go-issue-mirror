	"body": "@bradfitz Sorry for that, gb vendor fetch is somehow equivalent to a go get.\r\nNot sure this is specifc to gb as I couldn't reproduce with \"go get -v k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/api/v1\" since that package is not gettable in the current state (go generated code issue). If you know how to get a specific tag with go get I'll gladly make further testing (but as for now I doubt it is possible).\r\n\r\nConcerning the command I executed it is : \"gb vendor fetch -tag v1.3.0 k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/api/v1\"\r\nwhich outputs : \"golang_org/x/net/http2/hpack\" is not a valid import path\r\n\r\nNote: Not sure I'll open an issue with this, because I don't have another package where I can test this with \"go get\" and provide you more output.",
