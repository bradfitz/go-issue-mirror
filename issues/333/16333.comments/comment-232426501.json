My proposal would make the stdlib's vendored copy appear as `\"net/vendor/golang.org/x/net/http2\"` to the compiler, which it will treat as distinct.\r\n\r\nBecause `\"net/vendor/...\"` packages are only visible within the `\"net/...\"` package subpath, it's only a risk of collisions if users try to write their code in a `$GOPATH/src/net` directory, which seems like a bad practice.\r\n\r\nIf it makes you feel more comfortable, we have `$GOROOT/src/cmd/vendor/golang.org/x/arch/...` already, without any extra package path mangling.",
