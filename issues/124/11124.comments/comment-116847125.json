	"body": "fyi. crawshaw recently moved the use of toolexec and changed the way to initialize tool chains. There are still cases the move function is being used for but in most cases, I think we tried to be careful to put the src and dst under the same file system, but I may be wrong. @EtienneBruines, can you please sync the repo and run gomobile init to check if the problem went away? Many thanks.",
