In particular,\nmy network has NAT64, so this should even work with IPv4-only remote hosts, since the\nDNS64 will return proper AAAA records.\n\nI'm not sure how other languages/libraries handle this (maybe they check for the lack of\nIPv4-routes?). Go seems to be attempting to communicate to the A record every time,\nregardless of network configuration.\n\n$ cat test.go \npackage main\n\nimport \"net\"\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n        conn, err := net.Dial(\"tcp\", \"google.com:80\")\n        if err != nil {\n                fmt.Println(err)\n        }\n        fmt.Fprintf(conn, \"GET / HTTP/1.0\\r\\n\\r\\n\")\n}\n$ go run test.go\ndial tcp 173.194.42.72:80: network is unreachable\u003c/pre\u003e",
