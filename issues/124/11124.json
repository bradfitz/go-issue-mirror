	"body": "I'm issuing the command `gomobile init -v`, and its response ends with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInstalled Go for android/arm in /home/etiennebruines/workspaces/go/pkg/gomobile/work-542832590/go\r\nInstalled commands in /home/etiennebruines/workspaces/go/pkg/gomobile/work-542832590/go/bin\r\nbuilding gomobile toolexec\r\ngomobile: rename /home/etiennebruines/workspaces/go-all/pkg/gomobile/work-542832590/go/pkg/android_arm /tmp/gomobile-764944597/android_arm: invalid cross-device link\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not weird for a `rename` command to fail with that error. Usually this means that the `src` and `dst` are not on the same file system (see [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24210631/3243814)). But for those that have a lot of file systems (one for root, one for `/home`, `/tmp` as tmpfs, ...), this shouldn't prevent it from initializing. \r\n\r\nI think the gomobile-tool should fallback to \"copy to dst and delete src\". I have not found a workaround just yet. \r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to actually document this limitation and refer to the use of the `TMPDIR` environment variable (as some distributions might use `TEMP`, `TMP` or `TEMPDIR` ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMPDIR))) - but this only holds as long as we're using the [move](https://github.com/golang/mobile/blob/master/cmd/gomobile/init.go#L309-L328) function to copy to `/tmp`. \r\n\r\nFalling back to (potentially existing) tools such as `mv` may work on quite a lot of systems -- potentially not all, but probably all systems that are actually using the gomobile tool.
