	"body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nAIUI, #11469 fixed gccgo tip to match what Go 1.5 does for the type of syscall.RawSockaddr.Data on ppc64le, which sounds good, but it means that the type is different from previous releases of gccgo on ppc64le, which means that programs that used to compile now don't, including docker:\r\n\r\nhttps://launchpadlibrarian.net/214319094/buildlog_ubuntu-wily-ppc64el.docker.io_1.6.2~dfsg1-1ubuntu4_BUILDING.txt.gz\r\n\r\nI don't know that docker can be changed in a way that will build with both new and old gccgo, which seems pretty unfortunate. At least changing the Go 1.5 type would allow that, but it's way too late for that.",
