If you're giving math/rand a seed (and the same seed multiple times in different runs), it is because you're trying to make some nondeterministic code deterministic.  But surely you're also issuing the same sized reads in that case?\r\n\r\n\u003e Therefore, you can't fix seed and read pseudo-random bytes deterministically without fixing buffer size.\r\n\r\nIn other words, why would you not fix the buffer size if you were trying to make a computation deterministic?\r\n",
