The Read method was introduced in `Go1.6`, so the number of users dependent on it may be low.\r\n\r\nThat said, if we do change it, should we consider this change for `Go1.7` to reduce the amount of time the faulty behavior stays present? I'm almost certain that this change will break some code. The longer people are using and relying on the current behavior, the worse it will be later.",
