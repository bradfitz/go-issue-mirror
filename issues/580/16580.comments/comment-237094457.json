I traced usage of loader.Config.Cwd through the golang.org/x/tools/go/loader package and found a [somewhat relevant TODO](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/9e7459099f9afd6a15464d69d93c6eed49bb545d/go/loader/loader.go#L590), though it still doesn't explain what's going on.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this issue is less about the `eg` command and more about golang.org/x/tools/go/loader, which doesn't yet handle all the implications of the go15 vendor pattern.\r\n\r\n/cc @adonovan\r\n",
