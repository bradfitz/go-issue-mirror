Fixing that finds all sorts of other failures (e.g. \"GO386=xxx go tool 8g\" panic()s, I don't think solaris/386 is supported, dragonfly/386 definitely isn't supported, ...) but I didn't reproduce the reported failure.\r\n\r\nDid you mention me because of the comment \"TODO(mwhudson): actually think about this.\"? Apologies for the vague comment but all I did was disable some code when -linkshared or -buildmode=shared is passed. I don't think that's the cause.\r\n\r\n",
