I distilled the\nbug a little bit further and made it produce less output.\nI cannot really take anything more out without the bug\ndissapearing. I don't mind going with you through the code,\nor following instructions to help in any way I can.\nWhat I get as output of this new program is:\n\n0000000000000001110\n0000000000000001110\n0000000000000001110\n0000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/789/2/hello.go\"\u003ehello.go\u003c/a\u003e (882 bytes)",
