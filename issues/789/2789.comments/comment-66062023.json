Maybe a workaround\nwould be to use an intermediate precision when it comes to ideal floatingpoint\ncomparison? It wouldn't eliminate the problem but maybe give less surprising results.\n\nFor example, in mpcmpfltflt we could say ideal equality would be defined as \"truncations\nto some number of bits, maybe half the total chosen precision, are equal\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
