	"body": "@bradfitz I am asking in both comments if alternative approaches would be viable, and that has been left unanswered. I would always ask for this before attempting a patch. Specifically:\r\n* if querying `/proc/net/if_inet6` is viable (already verified it's not)\r\n* if connecting to `::1` port 0 would be viable\r\n* if skipping probing completely would be viable\r\n\r\nKnown the above, any patch would be greatly more useful and less of a waste :)",
