	"body": "In any case, most of closing this bug is doing the research on why it was done how it's currently done, and figuring out what to do instead on each operating system. I don't have the answers off hand. @mikioh might, but I don't.\r\n\r\nIdeally any patch would also document things better, since it wasn't entirely obvious to me from reading the source.\r\n\r\nI think we could probably start by doing the computation of the three supportsIP* booleans lazily, but still doing the bind-based probing on all operating systems. And then in a second change, you could change the probing on Linux to do something Linux-specific without bind.\r\n\r\nMaybe the three probe variables also need to be split into more finer-grained questions, if the variables are used for a combination of questions (client vs server related) and bind is appropriate for some questions and not others. Again, somebody needs to read the code and figure it out.\r\n",
