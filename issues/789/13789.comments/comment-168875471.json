It's possible that something is writing \" ok\\n\" to\na closed file descriptor but I can't see why whatever process that is would\nmagically have access to the output pipe from the $(go env GOROOT).\n\nThe quotes around the rm argument should have been there from the beginning\nand would have avoided the problem. Perhaps waiting for the other tests to\nfinish (CL pending) will also help.\n\nIf @ianlancetaylor is willing to close this, I certainly am.\n",
