	"body": "There are currently two problems with default `GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP` handling in the `make.bash` script.\r\n\r\nThe first problem is that the default value set in `make.bash` (`$HOME/go1.4`) will not be used by the `go dist` tool, since the new `GOROOT_BOOSTRAP` environment variable is not exported.  The code works only because the `go dist` tool uses the same default value.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is that `$HOME/go1.4` will be an invalid `GOROOT` for the majority of users, thus forcing the user to explicitly set the `GOROOT_BOOSTRAP` environment variable.\r\n\r\nI propose to change the default `GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP` value to the value returned by `go env GOROOT`, where the `go` command in `PATH` is used.  The `GOROOT_BOOSTRAP` should be exported.  As an example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP=${GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP:-$(go env GOROOT 2\u003e/dev/null)}\r\nexport GOROOT=\"$(cd .. \u0026\u0026 pwd)\"\r\n```",
