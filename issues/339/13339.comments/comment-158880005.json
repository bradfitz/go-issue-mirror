	"body": "As @crawshaw hinted at, I'd like to avoid incrementally adding a dozen odd SetThis and SetThat methods to the Window interface, one by one in an ad hoc manner. The NewWindowOptions type already lists things like fullscreen, title, icon, cursorHidden in its TODO comments. There are undoubtedly more we could add. I'd like to have some sort of principled approach to where we draw the line.\r\n\r\nOne consideration is that not all systems support programmatic resizing. For example, on mobile, the app has no say in its window size. Also, on X11, strictly speaking, the app can only make a request, and it's perfectly valid for the window manager, a separate program, to set the app window's size to be something different, such as what tiling window managers do.",
