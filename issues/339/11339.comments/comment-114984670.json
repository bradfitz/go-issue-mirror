	"body": "Bad news. Moving tools to GOMOBILE/tools/GOOS_GOARCH and using toolexec didn't fix the problem. Darwin/arm tools are ARM-only and don't execute on my host machine even though Android tools such as `GOMOBILE/android-ndk-r10d/arm/bin/compile` works on darwin/amd64.\r\n\r\nGood news. I inspected how Go toolchain is invoked if I bootstrap a darwin/arm cross compiler manually. It uses darwin_amd64 tools and clangwrapper.sh with some arguments missing from where we invoke the gomobile builds for iOS.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/Users/jbd/go/src/../misc/ios/clangwrap.sh -I . -fPIC -marm -pthread -fno-caret-diagnostics -Qunused-arguments -fmessage-length=0 -fno-common -print-libgcc-file-name\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I use clangwrapper as CC_FOR_TARGET and CXX_FOR_TARGET with these arguments, iOS builds will be probably achievable.",
