	"body": "@extemporalgenome Thanks for your comment on the notation that `x =\u003e p.X` looks almost like `x = p.X`. I don't think it does (if anything, it seems to express the exact opposite`p.X = x`) and you are the first to bring this up, but your feedback is registered.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could comment on the more minimal proposal which is alias declarations _for types only_?\r\n\r\nFinally, I disagree on the point that introducing alias declarations puts extra burden on novice programmers. Most novice programmers should never use this feature and it's certainly not something that should be advertised early on. The same is true for dot-imports. And labels and gotos. All these mechanisms have their use cases, and when you need them you really need them. But most of the time you don't.\r\n\r\nOne of the strengths of Go is that it can be taught in very small and easy steps, with few features requiring to know \"the whole language\" before understanding them. Alias declarations come last.",
