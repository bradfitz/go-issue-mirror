	"body": "IMO, composite packages is a mark *against* adding aliases.  It's too easy to make packages too big as it is, but at least the limit of having a single directory for a package is a disincentive.  If you could dump a whole hierarchy inside an internal folder and easily expose it via aliases, that just encourages people to have one package doing way too much.  Then when I go look at a package, to figure out what its types do I have to go spelunking into the bowels of the internal packages.... yuck.\r\n\r\nThis is actually a great example of the abuse that I was afraid would come with aliases.",
