(other things are still needed though)\r\n\r\n@perses \r\n\r\n\u003e I've asked if people can provide examples of aliasing being misused in other languages, that would be more constructive than just speculating that this will happen to Go.\r\n\r\nI think the proposal should be studied with the Go ecosystem in mind  because different languages have different ways of organizing code. Some have first class modules for instance etc. Looking at how aliases work elsewhere will not necessarily help.\r\n\r\nAlso as I understand the proposal, objects are not moved, they are referenced. That's one of the reason I am a -1 on this proposal for now. A reference will not work.",
