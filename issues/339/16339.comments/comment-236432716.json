If they are to be addressed it does seem like a counter-proposal is necessary. So far the package-alias seems to be one but it only applies if you want to move an entire package, so it doesn't seem very useful.\r\n\r\nSemVer is a useful tool and quite necessary where it applies. It clearly doesn't apply here. If you use package A that uses L1 and package B that uses L2 you can't pass around L1.T or L2.T to both A and B.\r\nIf L2.T was an alias to L1.T you could (provided just L2.T was backwards compatible with L1.T, not at all far-fetched, as was pointed out).",
