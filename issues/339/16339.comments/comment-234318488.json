	"body": "@bcmills The question is why introduce a language level feature when the problem is a package management one. Especially since any new feature has the capacity of being misused.\r\n\r\nIt's probable that another solution exists/could be found in terms of importing logic that doesn't involve aliases.\r\n\r\nIf you consider a package as a function which may take as input a package and returns Exports, the goal is to transform a single input function into a multiple input one.\r\nThat is not possible unless one uses an indirection.\r\n\r\nFor refactoring, why not introduce refactored packages then? In other terms, package level aliasing ?\r\n\r\nThis is just an idea that is not reallly formalized. But I think that the current proposal is not right as it is.",
