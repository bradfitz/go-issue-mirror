	"body": "If a thing is not exported and you want to export it, just change it's name to uppercase. Aliases seem neither helpful nor sensible to me, to \"export unexported things\". Same goes for aliasing into internal packages - by definition you have full control over both the internal subtree and everything that's using it, so if you want to export something from an internal package, don't put it into internal/.\r\n\r\nFor those reasons I think it's not a good idea to allow exporting unexported things; either giving a compilation error in the package that defines the alias (in the case of unexported identifiers) or in the package that uses it (maybe? In the case of internal packages. Because \"using an alias into an internal package is the same as using the aliased identifier\", so it should give an import error?), or also the package that defines the alias (probably less confusing).",
