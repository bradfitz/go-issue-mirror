You certainly don't speak for me.\r\n\r\nI never said I speak for anyone, I've did however a pretty good summation of all the chats about this topic both here and on other mediums. \r\n\r\n\u003e (Note: I am expressing a deeply held belief, rooted in technical arguments, for why the community at large and the open source community in particular would benefit from this, I am not trying to make any judgement of what the community at large wants)\r\n\r\nYes, maybe, but you are also ignoring what those types of people I've mentioned clearly express and march on with this.",
