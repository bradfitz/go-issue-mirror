	"body": "@bcmills The only way this proposal doesn't \"produces multiple names for the same type / function / variable\" is if it's rejected.\r\n\r\nI think the integration with godoc and other tools is the big one. It's mentioned in passing in the proposal. I think fleshing out how it would work would either assuage or validate fears and at the very least provide some concrete talking points.\r\n\r\nThe simplest implementation for godoc would just be a clickable link to where it's actually defined but that's not especially helpful. I don't think anyone would want that. If that's the extent of the integration then, yes, it would make package docs harder to read and reason about.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd like to see godoc pull in the docs automatically as if it were defined locally, which the proposal hints at, but still identify it is an alias with a link to the original package. (What happens to docs on the alias definition itself?) As long as that and \"go to definition\" works I'm happy on the tooling front.\r\n",
