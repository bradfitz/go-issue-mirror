But I would go even as far as saying I would not even allow that L1 work around to compile anymore in Go 2.\r\n\r\nI would trow a error `const X reference to other package name not allowed.`\r\n\r\nFor me this is just avoiding branching tools at the cost of code readability, and one should `git checkout` there L1 branch instead? Please make a simple repository in github that clearly shows that two `branches` L1 and L (or submodules) does not solve the problem thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
