Pkg B imports A and exports a wrapper function Bar that just calls Foo.\r\n3. Pkg C imports A and exports a wrapper function Baz that just calls Foo.\r\n4. Finally, package D imports B and C and calls Bar and Baz\r\n\r\nAnd of course that's possible with constants trivially. I think it's just that aliases make this a bit easier.\r\n",
