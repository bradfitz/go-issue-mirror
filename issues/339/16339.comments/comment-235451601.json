	"body": "I would like to hear whether anybody has a concern about `import p.N` other than the syntax.\r\n\r\nI kind of like `export` but it requires defining an additional top-level keyword.  This can be done but is awkward.  Another possibility would be\r\n\r\n    var p.V\r\n    const p.C\r\n    type p.T\r\n    func p.F\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that if the top-level keyword `var`, `const`, `type`, or `func` is followed by a qualified identifier, it means that that identifier is re-exported.  This syntax too is not great, but it doesn't require an additional keyword.",
