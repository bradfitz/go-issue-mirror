You now have to recompile every client of net/context.\r\n\r\nYou can see it like this... it would be the same thing as rewriting every import of net/context and replacing them by the std lib context import. You still need to recompile if you do that.\r\n\r\nIf the clients of net/context expose themselves some of the API of the net/context package, you have to recurse again.\r\n\r\nIt looks the same but you are changing the types exposed by net/context via a compile-time mechanism. It does not work in a refactoring setting. And is not scalable in an automated build setting either I'm afraid.\r\n\r\n",
