It's the way symlinks show up in directory listings, for instance. Also, it looks like it describes the indirection perfectly: I create a new identifier here that \"points\" to the real type there. The other direction seems much less intuitive: it would suggest some kind of import semantics: \"import T from pkg.T\". This doesn't fully describe what's going on: is T just a local name imported from pkg.T or is it exported? (I also see this as a possible issue with the \"import T\" syntax).",
