The go tool can enforce the imports because the meaning of import paths is not defined by the language (it is an externally agreed upon convention). As a consequence, the mapping of import paths to actual files is controllable from the outside of the compiler.\r\n\r\nAlias declarations on the other hand operate on compile-time internal objects only. It would be pretty intrusive to impose outside restrictions to the compiler at this point.",
