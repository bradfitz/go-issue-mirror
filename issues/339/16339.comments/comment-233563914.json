	"body": "As others have pointed out, this feels to me like changing the language to solve a problem with dependency (or version if you prefer) management. In other languages, one would change package, make a new release of said package, then each consumer would be updated to use this new release.\r\n\r\nI also have strong concerns about how this new wrinkle will be a net negative on those who teach the language, and those who have to learn this magic (as it will be infrequent) syntax and its wide ranging effects.\r\n\r\nI'm not in favour of this proposal. Compared to the real and present desire for features like multi dimensional slices, I find it hard to see how this proposal is more pressing -- in nearly 7 years of Go discourse I've heard nobody ask for this feature.\r\n\r\nI vote that this proposal not be accepted.",
