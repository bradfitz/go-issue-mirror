There are probably many situations where build tags can be used in refactoring situations.\r\n\r\nI probably didn't make a strong enough point for the other use cases of alias declarations that I consider important:\r\n\r\n1) Use of aliases to export the API of a component consisting of many packages (brought up several times so far).\r\n\r\n2) Potential use as replacement for dot-imports.\r\n\r\n3) Support for the \"import public\" feature in the Go implementation of protocol buffers. See: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#importing-definitions for more details. I have not discussed this at all so far. I will outline this in more detail in the design doc.",
