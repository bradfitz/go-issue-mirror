But this means that maybe you've never encountered this situation when you just need to move a type that's stable. Maybe other have encountered this situation. In fact, others have responded and mentioned they have. Please stop mentioning SemVer, in this case, as it doesn't apply here. If you do then you have the burden of backing up your statements and I ask you to  please provide examples (at least so that you'll elucidate me).\r\n\r\nWith all due respect, Go doesn't have aliases and any examples of misuse are by their nature speculative.",
