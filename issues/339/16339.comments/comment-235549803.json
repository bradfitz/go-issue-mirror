Many people here seem to agree with one but not the others. Voting yes on the proposal will open all of them.\n\nOn this second door (objective) of shortening permanent code:\n\nReadability is about mental indirections, before being about code lengths.\n\nIf i am forced to choose, i prefer code that is 20% longer with 20% less mental indirections than the opposite. Plus, 20% longer code often requires 20% less documentation to explain it\n\nThis is a after having believed for 20 years in abstractions, smart \u0026 efficient code, etc...\n\nPs : having less operators in the language and less indirections has a parallel, its called sparsity in machine learning, and is a big predictor of a model robustness\n\nRaphael\n\n\u003e Le 27 juil 2016 à 12:18, Gustavo Niemeyer \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e a écrit :\n\u003e Note that the var p.V and import p.V syntax closes the door to some day having a way to alias built in types. This is useful to using bulky type names without having to type all of it every single time, and without introducing a local type just to have a shorter \"alias\" as is commonly done today.\n\u003e —\n\u003e You are receiving this because you commented.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n\u003e \n",
