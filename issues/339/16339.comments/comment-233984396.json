Maybe other people have different experiences they'd like to share?\r\n\r\nThey're all over the C++ standard library, especially for string manipulation.  (This is the \"aliasing an internal implementation\" use-case.)  For example:\r\n* `std::string` is defined as an alias for `std::basic_string\u003cchar\u003e`\r\n* `std::iostream` is an alias for `std::basic_iostream\u003cchar\u003e`\r\n\r\nThere are also function aliases in the C++ standard library: the legacy C functions have aliases in the `std` namespace (e.g. `std::qsort`).  (This is kind of the \"refactoring\" use-case: the identifiers were moved from the top-level namespace into `std`.)",
