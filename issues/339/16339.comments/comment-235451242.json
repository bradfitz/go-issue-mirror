	"body": "@tombergan I'm not crazy about adding a config file to the build system.  Today Go analysis tools like guru don't have to know very much about the build system.  They have to know the language, and they have to know build tags (and build tags are found in the same files that they have to read anyhow).  Adding a config file known to the build system requires extending all tools that need to use the go/types packages to understand that config file as well: they have to know where to find it, they have to know to read it.  I don't think this complexity is negligible.  I don't like compiler directives (the magic comments listed in https://golang.org/cmd/compile) but I would vote for a compiler directive before I would vote for a separate file.",
