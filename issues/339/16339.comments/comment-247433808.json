But it seems it's not the case if (I'm sorry I'm very bitter now).\r\n\r\n\u003e I know it's maybe a bit unfair with some other proposals in some way but as long as they are willing to reverse the decision when it get messy, let them do what they like.\r\n\r\nOnce it lands in Go 1.8 there's no going back until the infamous Go 2.x.\r\n\r\n\u003e Look at it this way, Swift who is twice as popular as Go is breaking things more in every release then a toddler with a basketball in your living room haha. \r\n\r\nSwift is pretty much the only programming language (well there's Objective-C but everyone hates that) for a platform which has more users / programmers than Go has right now in the world. The comparison holds no value.\r\n\r\n\u003e Remember I was against it too but I will never stop somebody from trying his or her idea.\r\n\r\nWell, sorry, I'm going to be a sore loser on this one, just look at the list of nobodies that voted against this (we were told to use :+1: or :-1: is the way we can do this).  Also look like all the famous gophers, which might hold some weight on this and said no to it.\r\n\r\nI can only voice against it and I've done to the best that I could, sadly not enough. Allow me to be a sore loser and lets not dig into this anymore. Seems we can't change things anyway.",
