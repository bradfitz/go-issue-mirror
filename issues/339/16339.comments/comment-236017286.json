I like that `alias p.T` indicates that it is something else (an alias of a type). If someone new to Go was reading the code, the later makes it clear that this is something different that they need to look up.\r\n\r\nI think it needs to be a keyword though. `nil` is a value, it's not the same as `import` `type` or `alias`.",
