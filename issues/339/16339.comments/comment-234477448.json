In one regard, there's lots of precedent for tackling social problems with technical solutions and having that go badly. On the other hand, we've got plenty of precedent for that working well. Just one quick example: Go has exported and unexported identifiers. There's (mostly) no technical reason for that, but it provides a technical mechanism to delineate the boundaries of an API, and to enforce that one bit of code may not call another bit of code. That's a social issue in a similar vein (I don't want people calling some functions in my package, but I can't simply trust them to stick to the rules), but fixed quite successfully with a technical solution. A lot of software engineering wisdom boils down to that too, once considered from the right perspective.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that this proposal is the correct solution for the problems, but it is to say that sometimes technical solutions to social problems _is_ the right strategy.",
