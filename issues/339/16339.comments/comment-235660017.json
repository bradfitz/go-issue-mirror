It's why we don't have generics or every feature from other languages.\r\n\r\nThe justification for this is due to a lacking of package management features (compared to other languages). It would be solving that problem in an uncommon way.\r\n\r\nIf Go holds to it's grounds this could kill talks to bring in common methods to handle packages because we have this.\r\n\r\nAliases separate from package management problems are interesting to me. Given the Go teams history I'm wary of this proposal the way it's being proposed.\r\n\r\nDue to the history around features I want explicit assurances before engaging aliases outside of package management use cases.\r\n\r\n/cc @adg ",
