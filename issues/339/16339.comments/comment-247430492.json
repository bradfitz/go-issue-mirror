I know it's maybe a bit unfair with some other proposals in some way but as long as they are willing to reverse the decision when it get messy let them do what they like. Look at it this way, Swift who is twice as popular as Go is breaking things more in every release then a toddler with a basketball in your living room haha. Still allot of developers like Swift so much because it is evolving at lightning speed. Remember, I was against it too but I will never stop somebody from trying his or her idea. ",
