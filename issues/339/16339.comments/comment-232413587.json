I really think with the current proposed implementation this could be easily abused.\r\n2.) If 1 is correct, any way that someone uses \"aliases\" outside the intended context will need to be supported forever, and maybe we all have no idea what those may be now, they will come to light when hypothetically it breaks. We saw this happen a lot on the docker project and it's super unfortunate when it stops development of something else.\r\n3.) Seems like the main use case for this was for \"refactoring\" and to be honest I really think that only applies to super large scale companies and I think in any other context using it for refactoring would kind of be like \"cheating\".\r\n4.) It is intended for \"refactoring\" but nothing is stopping people from using it right out the gate of a new project for... reasons? giggles? idk. but people will do it.\r\n\r\ncc @kelseyhightower who also had some thoughts I can't express as eloquently as he can",
