I agree that this is completely unnecessary if you are using a system that has separate packages that are released on their own schedule and where each package importer advances to a new package on its own schedule.  But this is for a different kind of system (one that, not coincidentally, is used at Google): you have a single large project that is composed of many different packages, where all are built and released simultaneously.",
