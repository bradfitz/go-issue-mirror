	"body": "@natefinch  The stated motivation for this proposal is to aid in refactoring.  A bunch of aliases to the same type across codebases (users/teams/organizations) isn't in keeping with this goal.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we want to avoid chains of aliases. As soon as `vcs/org2/lib` creates an alias that points to `vcs/org1/lib.Type`, org1 can't refactor lib.Type using an alias without immediately breaking `vcs/org2/lib`.  The very thing this proposal is looking to avoid.  ",
