For example, to me, as a supporter of this change, this thread reads like making very clear technical arguments in favor that weren't disproved and I read @rsc's comment as very nuanced, balanced, admitting past failures but also giving a good justification of how this specific proposal differs from other proposals and not least of all technical.\r\nI am not saying my viewpoint is correct (it's not. It's very subjective). I am saying please consider that there is a very different way to read all of this.",
