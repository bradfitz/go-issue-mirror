	"body": "After mulling this over and reading the proposal a few times, I'm +1 on this feature as currently written in the proposal document.\r\n\r\nIt solves a real problem in a straightforward way, and will have approximately zero effect on the code I read and write day-to-day. (I don't find the \"it will be abused\" argument compelling whatsoever, as I can quickly find many examples of every language feature Go already has being used poorly.) I also like that afterwards, the existing aliasing in the language (e.g., uint8/byte) stops being a special case.\r\n\r\nI don't have any other arguments to add that haven't already been made excellently by @bcmills. I will note that in particular I am not convinced of the claim that package versioning solves the problems that aliasing does.",
