I think that's a valid concern.\r\n\r\n\u003e@dlsniper why do you repeat your arguments again and again despite them having been refuted before? I don't understand, am I missing something?\r\n\r\nThe issue is that they have not been _refuted_, but rather have been solipsistically _elided_. I don't have the technical excellence of Florin or Dave, but one of Go's virtues is that its design is a response to mess and chaos by **forcing** features to be orthogonal and unique and fundamentally necessary. This is not 3-index-slices nor can it be compared to such a feature. Furthermore, it's not actually the responsibility of Dave or Florin to provide a perfect counter-argument or counter-proposal â€“ the burden of proof and requirement to come back with a more perfect solution to the deeper, underlying issue which prompted this issue and proposal is on the _proposer._ What baffles me is that this has still not been shown to be a language _problem_ but it's a proposal for a language _solution_.",
