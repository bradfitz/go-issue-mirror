Or maybe have the experiment on a dev. branch.\r\n\r\nAliases alone may not be sufficient to split up a package easily because types whose definitions rely on unexported objects could make the exported types impossible to move (since import cycles are of course not desirable).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the proposal is simply about allowing a higher granularity in being able to rename objects at the package scope, such as math.Sinus into Sinus (which dot imports allow to do but coarsely) then I don't see any issue. People having a strong desire for generics may even get happy that way.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm wrong but that's the extent of my understanding so far.",
