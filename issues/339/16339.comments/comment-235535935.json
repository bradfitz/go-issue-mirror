But then you would have to specify what those abstractions resolve to.\r\n\r\nEven by adding aliases, you will break clients. This is another problem entirely from the one described in the proposal.\r\n\r\nI was against context moving \"as is\" in the std lib for multiple reasons. Currently the import path is the version in Go. Even though people may wish it were otherwise. Before introducing a feature such as the one discussed, people would expect to be shown clearly its effects on package boundaries I guess.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it's the refactoring methodology that might have to be rethought completely.",
