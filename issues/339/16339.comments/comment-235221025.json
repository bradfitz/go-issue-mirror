Supposing these aliases are exportable.\r\nSupposing a package B import C1,C2,C3... then according to the proposal, you have 3 names for the same object.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that what is wanted is actually to create an object copy in each of C1,C2,C3 scope? (because, again for type equality reason (object name equality + **pkg name** equality + object memory layout equality), I fail to understand how the current proposal can work in a refactoring setting).\r\n\r\nSaid otherwise, I think it would be great if the proposal had an example of how type info is kept identical at the API level for the refactored/split package.\r\n",
