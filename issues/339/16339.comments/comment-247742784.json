	"body": "Nice. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion would be to update the tooling, godef and guru, to be alias aware at the same time as the trial implementation.\r\n\r\nIf one were to equip the \"jump to definition\" operation of godef (which I find indispensable) with the ability to jump to the alias and land on the \"original\" type side of the alias, then: two successive jumps (the same keypress 2x in a row) would take you from use location to the alias location, and from there to the underlying type definition.\r\n\r\nBenefit: make aliases easy to adjust to, provide lots of transparency, and allay comprehensibility concerns.",
