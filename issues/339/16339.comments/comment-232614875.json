That is useful for signaling clients of packages. This might be more the case in manual refactoring and maybe comes in to play with versioning of a package. In the case of automatic refactoring, I think having deprecation messages is not a good feature because one might tend to ignoring them.\r\n\r\nI'd like also to note there is still `gofmt -r` and `eg`.",
