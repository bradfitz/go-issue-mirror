On balance, I think this feature is incredibly important for Go's primary use case, namely \"make a better environment to meet the challenges of scalable software development, software worked on and used by many people, with limited coordination between them, and maintained for years.\" (See [Go, Open Source, Community](https://blog.golang.org/open-source) from Gophercon 2015.) This applies both within Google and outside Google. It was likely a mistake to emphasize only the former in the initial proposal. Noted for the future.\r\n\r\nIt's true that other proposals have languished, most notably multi-dimensional slices. That's bad, and we're working to address that. I do want to note that an important distinction between the two proposals is that multi-dimensional slices are not a direct target of the use case I just mentioned and consequently not a primary focus of the Go project. (In contrast, relatively more attention has been paid to things like vendoring and versioning, which fit that focus better.) I see the relative inattention to multi-dimensional slices not as a question of Google vs non-Google provenance but as a question of Go's intended focus (and overlap with the areas of expertise of the Go developers) vs not. All that said, I'm glad that we're doing a better job working through all the proposals.",
