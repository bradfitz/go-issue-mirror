Yet people don't do this in general.\r\n\r\nWe can also play with further restrictions (for instance, we can disallow the use of a qualified name if an alias has been defined for it in a package).\r\n\r\nMany concerns about misuse have been brought up in this thread; but we really don't know how much misuse we're going to see in practice without getting some experience with the feature. I believe unintentional misuse will be insignificant. Especially with all the restrictions we are planning to put in place.",
