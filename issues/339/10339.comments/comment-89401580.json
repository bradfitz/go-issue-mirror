This is,IMO, the strength of the model wherein I change GOPATH - goimports and every other tool simply do not know about the existence of non-vendored anything.\r\n\r\nI'd rather see the go tool learn to read a local .gopath_override file or something, which I could check in with the repo, and then use non-rewriting vendoring.",
