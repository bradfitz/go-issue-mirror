The patch is only correct for the second case.\n\nThis is a valid bug though since we're not following the RFC here.\nSection 7.4.6 of RFC 4346 states that we must send a certificate\nmessage with an empty certificate_list if the server requests a\nclient certificate but we have none to give.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
