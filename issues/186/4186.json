	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nFor users who have downloaded a binary version of Go (or are using one packaged by their\nOS vendor), using go get without GOPATH set will cause the operation to fail as they do\nnot have permission to write to /usr/local/go (or similar path). This is confusing and\nleads to behaviour like chmod'ing their Go installation a+w.\n\nWhile GOPATH is documented in the installation documentation, over the past 6 months is\nhas been a common stumbling block for new Go users.\n\nI suggest that go get should refuse to download a package if GOPATH is not set and exit\nwith a message directing users to a solution.\n\nPlease use labels and text to provide additional information.\n\nProposed fix and discussion, \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/6397048/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/6397048/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
