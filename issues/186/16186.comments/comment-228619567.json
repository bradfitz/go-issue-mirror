	"body": "I don't think it's useful to discuss this on the issue tracker, unless you want to turn it into a formal proposal.  I recommend taking this to the golang-dev mailing list.\r\n\r\nHave you read the proposals linked from issue #15292?\r\n\r\nWhen and how is something like your `NewSlice` function compiled?  Is `elem_type_of_receiver_ptr` a compile time or run time operation?\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this.  If you want to turn it into a proposal, please comment, but a proposal needs to be complete and needs to describe implementation details.  See the proposals linked from #15292 for minimal examples of what a complete proposal requires.",
