The \"mtime hack\" is fundamentally at odds with #3895. It's impossible to tell the difference between one person's \"mtime hack\" and another person's removing source files from the directory and expecting a rebuild.\r\n\r\nYou may be able to keep on with this subterfuge provided you create a set of dummy source files with exactly the same names as the original source files you compiled to produce the .a file, no more, no less, no changed names, and you have to put the real import blocks into the source files, so that the computed set of dependency packages is also the same.\r\n\r\nOr you could distribute a copy of the go command that disables the p.buildID != targetBuildID check in pkg.go, but I think that will cause more problems than you might like.",
