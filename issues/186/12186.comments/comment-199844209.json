Some suggestions:\r\n\r\nbinary package foo\r\n\r\n//binary\r\npackage foo\r\n\r\nor pick any other simple mechanism to indicate there are no sources for this package so the compiler should never try to rebuild it.\r\n\r\nThe real world does not/cannot always provide sources.  This is not a hard problem, but it is a very important issue to commercial success in a segment of the software business.  Those companies will not release source code so they can support/use Go.  They will simply not use Go.",
