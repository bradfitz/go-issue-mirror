One annoyance I found\nwhile looking at Go is that every page on golang.org has the same title. This is really\nannoying for using the reference documentation with numerous tabs for different packages\nopen as it is hard to know which tab is for the package I want. It would be useful if\nthe titles reflected the content of the page.\u003c/pre\u003e",
