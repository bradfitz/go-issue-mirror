Our distribution script implements the \"mtime hack\" discussed [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28407323), packaging dummy source files that only contain the package declaration line and .a files that have an mtime later than the corresponding source files.\r\n\r\nThen to test our distribution we try to build an executable that imports the libraries in our distribution.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to see?\r\nA built executable.\r\n\r\nWhat did you see instead?\r\nThe go tool complains about missing structs and funcs in our dummy go files.\r\n\r\nThis issue is also referenced in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/2775\r\n\r\nI also tried to use the shared library feature of go1.5 to distribute our library, but that appears to also require the source code.",
