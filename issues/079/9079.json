	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe build infrastructure uses old code.google.com paths everywhere in the infrastructure.\nThis needs to be fixed, but there are a few different strategies:\n\na) Do the full rename everywhere. This includes a potentially risky mass update of the\nbuild dashboard datastore. The watcher tool will need to updated to use \u0026quot;go\nget\u0026quot; to initially fetch repositories instead of \u0026quot;hg clone\u0026quot;. The builder\ndaemons would not need to be updated.\n\nb) Leave the paths as-is in the dashboard datastore, but update the builder daemons to\nrewrite the paths before checking out the code. This requires updating all the running\nbuilders, but is the lowest risk approach.\n\nc) Have the dashboard app use the new paths in all its communications with the builders\nand watcher, but keep using the old paths in the datastore. This also requires updating\nthe watcher code. The risk here is that we don't catch all the cases and corrupt the\ndatastore by accidentally puttingÂ in references to the new paths. \n\nApproach \u0026quot;a' is the hardest but least gross approach. \u0026quot;c\u0026quot; is also\ndifficult and also the most gross. \u0026quot;b' is kinda gross but also low risk.\n\nI might go ahead with plan B just to get 1.4 out the door, with a view to implementing\nplan A further down the track.\u003c/pre\u003e",
