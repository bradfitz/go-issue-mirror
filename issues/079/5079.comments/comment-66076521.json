The calling process must be a session leader  and  not\n              have  a  controlling  terminal  already.   If  this  terminal is\n              already the controlling terminal of a  different  session  group\n              then the ioctl fails with EPERM, unless the caller is root (more\n              precisely: has the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) and arg  equals  1,\n              in which case the terminal is stolen, and all processes that had\n              it as controlling terminal lose it.\n\nIt seems to me EPERM may be correct here. What are you trying to do? What does it look\nlike in C when it's working right?\u003c/pre\u003e",
