I am getting\nredefinition errors for the AMD64 Registers when it tries to compile\nthe 8db.c file.\nThe included file that defines the registers is /usr/include/sys/\nucontext.h.  The definitions in question are R0,R1,R8-R15.  I am\ncompiling with the all-arm.bash script.\n\nIs there a way to only compile the arm compiler suite in an arm\nenvironment, as it seems unlikely that one would cross compile for\ni386 or amd64 on the N900?\u003c/pre\u003e",
