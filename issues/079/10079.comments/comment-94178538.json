Only -N is necessary to reproduce the error.\r\n - The negative amounts of stack corresponds to splitting functions resetting the available stack space. I verified that every negative amount corresponds to a splitting function. As corroborating evidence, every negative amount also corresponds to a reset to 512, presumably the stack limit.\r\n\r\nI don't know why the error only appears in the runtime test, but apart from that the error seems benign in the sense that -N disables regopt which in turn increases stack pressure, triggering a stack overflow. An obvious fix is to raise the stack limit for -N builds, but I'm not sure that is easily done across the compile/link split.",
