	"body": "Barring a fix for this, the documentation for ReadForm is misleading and would cause most people to believe that large parts would go to disk-backed storage. It could be updated to point out the hazard of /tmp on modern Linux systems and advise people to set TMPDIR.\r\n\r\nSince the size of swap space is usually bounded on Linux systems, it is more precious than regular disk space and thus use of swap vs. use of disk is not strictly equivalent.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of others, this issue can be worked around by setting a default TMPDIR. This is at least safer than hoping the environment will do so:\r\n```go\r\nif os.Getenv(\"TMPDIR\") == \"\" {\r\n  os.Setenv(\"TMPDIR\", \"/var/tmp\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTMPDIR is not used by Windows, so this code is inconsequential on that platform.",
