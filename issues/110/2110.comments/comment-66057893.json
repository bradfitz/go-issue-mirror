A previous field in the struct referenced a type in a different package\nthat could not be imported (and I got an error for that), but then the compiler ignored\nthe remainder of the struct and gave me the misleading error message.\n\nSo this is still an unhelpful compile error, but it's not as bad as I thought.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-medium**, removed **priority-high**._",
