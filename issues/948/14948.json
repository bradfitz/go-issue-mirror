	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.6 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nlinux/amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/_P4s_RvFbr\r\n\r\nThis program mistakenly defines a function called \"color\" that returns a \"color.Color\". The intent was for the return type to refer to the \"image/color\" package, but of course the name was shadowed by the function itself.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nA non-confusing error message perhaps explaining that \"color\" is a function or perhaps that \"color\" refers to itself.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n```\r\nprog.go:9: typechecking loop involving color\r\n\tprog.go:9 color.Color\r\n\tprog.go:9 \u003cT\u003e\r\n\tprog.go:9 color\r\n\tprog.go:9 \u003cnode DCLFUNC\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile technically correct, this error message reads like an internal failure of the type checker, especially since it's outputting internal compiler node names and gives no details about what lines 2 through 5 mean.\r\n\r\n/cc @griesemer",
