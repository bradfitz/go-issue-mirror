If you look in cmd/ld/data.c:^dynrelocsym, you will see that we add JMP instruction for \"dynamic\" symbols where sym-\u003eplt == -2 (like GetCurrentThreadId) but only if sym-\u003egot != -2. Sometimes (in some imported packages) GetCurrentThreadId has sym-\u003egot != -2, and sometimes sym-\u003egot == -2 (see in cmd/ld/ldpe.c). So if you use both of these packages at the same time, you end up generating JMP when you should not or vice versa.\r\n\r\nAlex",
