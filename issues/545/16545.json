	"body": "**Feature request**\r\n\r\nI would like for `go get` to support downloading tarballs, in addition to the current git/hg/svn/bzr support.\r\n\r\nSince the argument to `go get` is a package name, this should be implemented as an extra backend to the current `go-import` meta tag / `?go-get=1` system as described in https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Remote_import_paths .\r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\n\r\n1. To offer a latency-insensitive method for deploying `go get`-able packages on object storage servers.\r\n2. To offer a maximally lightweight method for deploying `go get`-able packages on low-end servers.\r\n3. To support a pre-existing packaging workflow that produces tarball artefacts.\r\n\r\n**Implementation**\r\n\r\nI think it should be possible to implement initially in `src/cmd/go/vcs.go` as a new `vcsCmd` type that shells out to external wget/curl and tar binaries, in much the same way as the existing code.\r\n\r\nThis proposal succeeds #14076 .\r\n\r\nDo you think this would be accepted by the Go project? If so, I am happy to develop and submit a patch with a goal of having this in Go 1.8.",
