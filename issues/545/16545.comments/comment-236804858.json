But i don't think this behavior is contractual. There's no mention of it in https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Download_and_install_packages_and_dependencies , only to \"use the network to update the named packages and their dependencies\".\r\n\r\nI see some possible options:\r\n\r\n1. Destroy any local modifications. Preserving local modifications is a side effect of using `git` that does not apply to all uses of `go get -u`. \r\n\r\n2. Display a warning with `go get -u` saying that `go get -u -f` is required\r\n\r\n3. Reinvent several change-tracking features of git... probably unwise.\r\n\r\nSo How about 1 or 2 above?\r\n",
