This can be useful if the source is a local fork\r\nof the original.\r\n```\r\n\r\n`-f` is essentially \"just do a git pull, don't check that it's pulling from the right place\". \r\n\r\nIf we want this at all, then I suggest just returning an error and failing early, such as when there are local modifications for a versioned package. People will need to remove the package directory to continue with a `go get -u` with tarball source.",
