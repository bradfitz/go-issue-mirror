	"body": "In [this reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/3jlr82/test_coverage/cuqnvdz?context=4), /u/jerf has a nice suggestion: label lines that should be impossible to reach to improve coverage. Something like follows:\r\n\r\n    res, err := prudentFunction(\"constant\")\r\n    if err != nil {\r\n      panic(fmt.Sprintf(\"The impossible has happened: %v\", err)) // gocover: Ignore\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe coverage tool could then instrument the line and ignore it if there are 0 passes, and issue an error if there were more than zero.",
