The only work around I could find was\nopening the output of the web commands yourself.\n\nProblem #2:\nThe list commands do not work, go tool objdump stops responding and then windows kills\nobjdump.  The easiest fix I found was copying pprof into the same directory as the exe\nand profile.\n\nAlso tried using strawberry perl to run pprof via the command prompt.\n\nHere is the output.\nC:\\Users\\Jared\\go\\src\\test\u003eperl pprof test.test.exe out.raw\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\nWelcome to pprof!  For help, type 'help'.\n(pprof)\u003c/pre\u003e",
