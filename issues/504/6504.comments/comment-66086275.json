But spending an hour\ntrying to figure out why the changes I made while debugging a GOPATH-resident package\nwere not having any effect when doing \"go run\" was certainly discouraging.\n\nPersonally I'd prefer to be forbidden from working outside the GOPATH by having the \"go\"\ntool give an error, rather than \"discouraged\" by having the behavior silently change.\u003c/pre\u003e",
