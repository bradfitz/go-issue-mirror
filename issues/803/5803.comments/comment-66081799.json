But\nI don't really understand \"library routine\", I'll have to take a look at os/user more\nclosely.\n\nAnother different of the socket connection I just found out is that the program will\nfail to open the socket  if the syslog server is down (obviously). Other programs keep\nlogging in the void happily.\u003c/pre\u003e",
