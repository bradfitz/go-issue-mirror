I can't figure out what version of gomobile I have installed, but I noticed something else odd:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gomobile build -target=android golang.org/x/mobile/example/basic\r\nusage: gomobile [package]\r\n\r\nBuild compiles and encodes the app named by the import path.\r\n\r\nThe named package must define a main function.\r\n\r\nIf an AndroidManifest.xml is defined in the package directory, it is\r\nadded to the APK file. Otherwise, a default manifest is generated.\r\n\r\nIf the package directory contains an assets subdirectory, its contents\r\nare copied into the APK file.\r\n\r\nThese build flags are shared by the build, install, and test commands.\r\nFor documentation, see 'go help build':\r\nTODO:\r\n\t-a\r\n\t-tags 'tag list'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've removed the gomobile binary (I couldn't even get a version using the version flag) and reinstalled gomobile which solved the problem. I'm really sorry, it looks like I had an old version installed, maybe in gobin.\r\n",
