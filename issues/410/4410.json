The correct names can be had by changing\nthe yacc.go long literal string, where the function $$Tokname is defined, to refer to\n(c-3) in place of c, for all uses of c other than the final return statement.\n\nI believe the reason it is off by three is that the first three private tokens are set\nby the yacc.go lines below, and these three offset the user-defined names by three.\ndefin(0, \u0026quot;error\u0026quot;)\ndefin(1, \u0026quot;$accept\u0026quot;)\ndefin(0, \u0026quot;$unk\u0026quot;)\u003c/pre\u003e",
