	"body": "I'm not on the go team, but in general, timers are best-effort kinds of things in every general computing environment. Unless you're running on a real-time embedded operating system you can't rely on timer ticks to be accurate. You have two choices -- either spend cycles polling the real-time clock, and fire off your timer ticks yourself, or use the RTC to calculate the actual time spent (as you've done here) and adjust the result based on actual time elapsed.\r\n\r\nIn game development, you generally build your physics engine to take a deltaT parameter and pass that in on every tick, so that variable-time ticks average out. If you rely on timers to occur on a fixed interval, generally you'll lag behind as ticks go long or get delayed.\r\n\r\n(Notice, by the way, that inside your timer loop you're doing a format and a print. That alone could be causing your problem.)\r\n\r\nIf it were up to me, I would close this as not a bug.",
