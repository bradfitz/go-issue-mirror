The github version is less coupled, and\n\u003e uses a newer font package under golang.org/x, one that supports a variety\n\u003e of font file formats. This \"package font\" currently lives at\n\u003e golang.org/x/exp/shiny/font, because I was working on shiny as well, and\n\u003e they're sort of related, in that many GUI programs want to render text. It\n\u003e isn't necessarily tied to shiny (an experimental GUI library), though, and\n\u003e long term, the font packages should live somewhere other than under\n\u003e golang.org/x/exp.\n\u003e\n\u003e Given that people will be updating their import paths anyway, it might\n\u003e make sense to move \"package font\" out from exp now, so that people update\n\u003e their import paths just once instead of once now and a second time later.\n\u003e\n\u003e Thus, I propose to move font, font/plan9font and its example program out\n\u003e from\n\u003e golang.org/x/exp/shiny/font\n\u003e to live instead at\n\u003e golang.org/x/image/font\n\u003e\n\u003e \"package font\"'s exported API isn't frozen yet, but this new location is\n\u003e still under golang.org/x, not the standard library, so the API freeze\n\u003e doesn't necessarily apply.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/12410\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
