	"body": "The point of the second approach is that it works for all versions of Go.\r\n\r\n\u003e I'm sure that SWIG could be changed to support pre-1.4 and post-1.3 simultaneously.\r\n\r\nUsing cgo, yes; otherwise, no.  I'm really pretty sure I'm right about this.  A command line option is painful for users, but it is true that we could have the go tool pass it.\r\n\r\nThe first approach should work for all versions of Go when SWIG is invoked manually.  It would not work for older versions of Go when using the older go tool.  The main benefit of this approach is that it would work for all foreseeable versions of Go going forward, unlike the other approaches.  Go is not going to break existing cgo programs.",
