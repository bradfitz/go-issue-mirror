	"body": "@davecheney Clarification:\r\nThis issue is about a package with Go/SWIG code that doesn't use cgo at all. This works under previous Go releases but the Go master gives the error 'C source files not supported without cgo' on a 'go build' run. The temporary workaround is to add a dummy 'import \"C\"' to bypass this error. See also the example code under: https://gist.github.com/michael-schaller/94a2ee39bde248c83742",
