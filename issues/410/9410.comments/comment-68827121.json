	"body": "I propose this stop-gap solution before we switch swig to generate cgo\nfiles (but that will still require changes to cmd/go, so I don't understand\nhow that could handle the compatibility with older Go releases.)\n\nWe make swig generate two files x_gc.c for older pre 1.5 Go releases,\nand x_gc.go for Go 1.5+. They contains the same information, just in\nC or Go.\n\nThe older Go release don't know about x_gc.go file, so it will continue to\nuse x_gc.c.\n\ncmd/go from Go 1.5+ explicitly ignore x_gc.c and use x_gc.go. Go 1.5\nwill require SWIG 3.0.5 or above.\n\nWhat do you think? As long as people are only using cmd/go to build\nswig packages, it should provide compatibility with both pre-1.5 and\npost-1.5 Go releases.\n\nIf people are using custom makefiles to build swig package, they will\nhave to adapt to Go 1.5 changes, but they need to do that no matter\nwhat anyway.",
