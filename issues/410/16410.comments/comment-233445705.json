There is a lot of guesswork involved to figure out the types of all objects. In my case it failed to recognize most of them and I had to add an additional heuristic that tries to identify types by matching their GC signature.\r\n\r\nI would love to see a better tool, heap dumps are invaluable when it comes to finding memory leaks.\r\n\r\n@randall77 works on Go and can probably say more about this.\r\n\r\n",
