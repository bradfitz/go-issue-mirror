This means less work for the heapdump library, however, it also means the heapdump library won't be able to process ordinary core files as generated by gcore.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to not to have a special ELF section, but for the runtime to construct a data structure at a known symbol with the high-level information the heap dumper needs in a form that's convenient for the heap dumper. This would be easy to read out of the core file and wouldn't require any special core dump support. We definitely want ordinary system core dumps to work, both because that's easier for bootstrapping and because that's the only way you're going to get a core dump on OOM.",
