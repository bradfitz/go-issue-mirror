We only provide enough randomness\nto make sure people aren't depending on iteration order.  We do it to ensure that we can\nchange the map implementation at some future time and not break people's incorrect code.\n\nYes, the iteration is not random if the first bucket has \u0026lt;=1 element.  That will only\nhappen with very sparse maps, which requires inserting and then deleting most elements. \nI'm not particularly worried about that corner case.\n\nThe O(n^2) pop problem is more worrying.  Starting at a random bucket as in 1.2 would\nhelp.  Maybe better is to keep track of (a conservative approximation of) the minimum\nnonempty bucket.\u003c/pre\u003e",
