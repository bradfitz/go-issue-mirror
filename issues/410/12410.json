	"body": "I've recently told people (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/tr-MftD7kbo) to update their code's imports from code.google.com/p/freetype-go to github.com/golang/freetype.\r\n\r\nThe old code.google.com version's text drawing code was tightly coupled to the freetype/truetype package. The github version is less coupled, and uses a newer font package under golang.org/x, one that supports a variety of font file formats. This \"package font\" currently lives at golang.org/x/exp/shiny/font, because I was working on shiny as well, and they're sort of related, in that many GUI programs want to render text. It isn't necessarily tied to shiny (an experimental GUI library), though, and long term, the font packages should live somewhere other than under golang.org/x/exp.\r\n\r\nGiven that people will be updating their import paths anyway, it might make sense to move \"package font\" out from exp now, so that people update their import paths just once instead of once now and a second time later.\r\n\r\nThus, I propose to move font, font/plan9font and its example program out from\r\ngolang.org/x/exp/shiny/font\r\nto live instead at\r\ngolang.org/x/image/font\r\n\r\n\"package font\"'s exported API isn't frozen yet, but this new location is still under golang.org/x, not the standard library, so the API freeze doesn't necessarily apply.",
