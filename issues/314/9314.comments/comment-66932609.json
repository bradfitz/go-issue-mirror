As explained above, it also ignores build tags.\n\nGiven that they ignore build tags intentionally, why should they take -tags?\n\nYou're fighting the vanity import checking. Why? There are more obvious and\ncorrect way\nto do it.\n\nIf you are complaint about some commands hang, please provide more details.\n(note, it's\nprobable that the command is just waiting for data from stdin.)",
