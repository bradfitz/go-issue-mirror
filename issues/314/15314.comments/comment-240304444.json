If there's one thing you can't figure out, then just check the rest of the change is sane and send it out.\r\n\r\nYou should add a comment to the change once you've mailed it to indicate what help you still need, and add [\"DO NOT SUBMIT\"](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/b0spe4y7pFE/9Gcpkc8pv7IJ) on the *second* line of the commit message to indicate that the CL is currently unworkable. Per @rsc do not submit means \"something you do want people to see and review but that you know is not ready\".\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more info.",
