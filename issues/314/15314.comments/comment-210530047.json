In the XML decoder there is a \",any\" tag that you can use to say \"unexpected things go here\". I wonder if JSON should allow a map[K]V (K=string, V=interface{} would be common but not strictly required) to have a tag `json:\",any\"` to collect otherwise ignored key-value pairs. Then the decoder can do whatever it needs to do with them. Similarly on encoding those would have to be reinserted into the marshalled object.\r\n\r\nIt might be too late for Go 1.7 to work all this out.\r\n",
