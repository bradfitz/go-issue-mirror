	"body": "Thanks for the initial feedback on gerrit it has been helpful. Can I convince a consensus to change the name of the new option from `DisallowUnknownFields` to `DisallowUnusedKeys`? The motivation to change 'Fields' to 'Keys' is that the new option generates an error based on ignored JSON keys not based on ignored struct fields. The motivation to change 'Unknown' to 'Unused' is more subjective: Unused is a simple definition of the JSON keys that generate an error. Unknown JSON keys are defined as those keys which are unused.",
