One downside to adding that as a struct field would be that for deeply nested structures, you'd need to add the field to multiple structs and do a lot of manual bookkeeping after unmarshalling. One big advantage is no (terribly named) new method on Decoder and that it works with Unmarshal too.\r\n\r\nWould that same map be used to add additional keys during Marshal? Or ignored there?",
