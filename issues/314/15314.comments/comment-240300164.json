Do I submit it to  gerrit even though it needs additional work? I've created a pull request from my fork against my fork so that the changes can be browsed: https://github.com/mspiegel/go/pull/1/files.\r\n\r\nThe failing test is related to a key that is being \"annihilated\", that's the terminology in the source code when two fields in a struct have the same JSON name.
