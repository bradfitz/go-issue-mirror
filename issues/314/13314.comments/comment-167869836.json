	"body": "Hi Thomas, thanks for reporting this crash.\r\n\r\nThe particular crash you're seeing isn't caused by too many open files (though that has been a problem in the past), but a sanity-check assertion, one that was recently removed due to some internal design changes that made it irrelevant.  Could you sync and build the latest code in `golang.org/x/tools` and try again?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nalan\r\n\r\nBTW, the version numbers you reported relate to the main `golang.org` repo which provides the toolchain and the standard library, but not godoc itself.  Use this command instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  $ cd $GOPATH/src/golang.org/x/tools \u0026\u0026 git log | head -n 1\r\n```\r\n",
