	"body": "It is pretty lame to see no built-in support for LDAP v3. LDAP is a most widely used protocol for authentication and identity management. Having a core package with full ASN/DER/BER support will make it very easy for everyone. Mozilla C LDAP SDK and Java JNDI could be good reference points for this implementation. I would love to see LDAP included in roadmap for golang (along with ASN/BER/DER which will open the doors for server side implementation as well).",
