I can't really reproduce it reliably and the code is not\nopen, but it was on linux/amd64, GOMAXPROCS=8 and the backtrace is the same as reported\nby fullung.\n\nSometimes, instead of the segfault, I would get\n\"runtime: signal received on thread not created by Go.\"\nalthough my program is pure Go (but the Go tree has CGO_ENABLED).\u003c/pre\u003e",
