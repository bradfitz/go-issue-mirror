	"body": "We already have it in the \"genssa\" section, and it's pretty simplifies understanding what's going on. I propose to do the same for other sections of the output.\r\n\r\nSince writing `(sourcefile.go:42)` will make output noisier it would be better to show just line numbers in the left column and make them gray colored and with smaller font size than the code (so it looks like in editors).\r\n\r\nIf you ok with that I can show my vision of design for approval and then provide CL.",
