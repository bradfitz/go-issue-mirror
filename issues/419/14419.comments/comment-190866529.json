The cost is ~30ns per goroutine, similar to #14420.\r\n\r\nI could simply remove it. I'm a bit weary of doing that because it's a good check. If I lift gcscandone into a contiguous array as I proposed in #14420, I suspect the check will be roughly free (and now I have the benchmarks to confirm that :)",
