As described in the release notes like \"The net package will now Dial hostnames by trying each IP address in order until one succeeds\", from Go 1.5 Dial and its siblings do more work known as \"connect by name\" when you pass a destination \"name.\" Also it requirse more file descriptors than Go 1.4 and below.\r\n\r\nTry the following snippet and variables:\r\n- ulimit -n 10; export GODEBUG=netdns=go\r\n- ulimit -n 10; export GODEBUG=netdns=cgo\r\n```\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n        \"fmt\"\r\n        \"net\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n        for i := 0; ; i++ {\r\n                c, err := net.Dial(\"tcp\", \"www.example.com:80\")\r\n                if err != nil {\r\n                        fmt.Println(i, err)\r\n                        break\r\n                }\r\n                fmt.Println(i, c.RemoteAddr())\r\n                //c.Close()\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI suppose that you may have various errors depending on the circumstances. Perhaps there's a room for improvement--reporting error values in dialing with \"connect by name.\"",
