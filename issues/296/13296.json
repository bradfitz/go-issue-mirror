	"body": "When running in command-line mode, specifying the `-goroot` flag has no effect.  Running:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngodoc -goroot=/usr/local/go1.4.2 math/big\r\n```\r\nwould list `Float` too:\r\n\r\n    Package big implements multi-precision arithmetic (big numbers). The\r\n    following numeric types are supported:\r\n\r\n        Int    signed integers\r\n        Rat    rational numbers\r\n        Float  floating-point numbers\r\n\r\nIf served over HTTP (`godoc -goroot=/usr/local/go1.4.2 math/big -http=:6060`), the resulting documentation page is as expected.\r\n\r\nSetting `GOROOT` environment variable instead works as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGOROOT=/usr/local/go1.4.2 godoc math/big\r\n```\r\n",
