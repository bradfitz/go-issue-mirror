We don't have any data structures\nyet that require the use of Iter. \n\nWhether channel iterator access turns out to be a\ngood idea for arbitrary data structures is yet to\nbe determined.  It obviously needs some work, but\nit's not a top priority right now (garbage collector,\nmaybe generics, maybe exceptions, ...).\n\nHowever, using channels for iteration isn't the only\nreason to have range on channels.  The examples like\nthe prime sieve (or, a real example, the rpc package)\nmake good use of range over channels.\u003c/pre\u003e",
