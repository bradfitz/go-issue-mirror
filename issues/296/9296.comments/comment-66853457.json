What do you mean?\r\n\r\nBut I don't think your patch is quite what we want. We still want to re-use the git repo $GOROOT we place at /goroot in the Linux docker images as a base, and only git pull up from that to our target build hash.\r\n\r\nI fear that your patch will cause way too many git clone operations, which weigh in at 50+ MB each, and lots of disk I/O.\r\n",
