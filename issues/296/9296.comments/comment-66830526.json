The builder will generate a VERSION file\ncontaining only the sha1 commit hash.\nThat was necessary because hg clone is so slow on certain builders, and I\nswitched to hg export, which sped\nup the process at least 10x on the slower builders, but without the .hg\ndirectory, cmd/dist can't figure out the\nversion, so a hard-coded VERSION file was generated by the builder.\n\nNow that we switched to git, we don't need that speed hack anymore.",
