	"body": "Named parameters have been requested in the past, and they have been rejected with good reason.  However, I have approached this language feature from a different angle.  I feel like it would improve legibility and maintainability throughout Go libraries and executables.  \r\n\r\nI have written up a proposal on Google Docs here: [goo.gl/8KdnEG](http://goo.gl/8KdnEG).  **Some contributors have already begun commenting.**\r\n\r\n I just learned of the new proposal process. I would love some feedback.  Should I go ahead and fork `golang/proposals` and modify the doc to meet the new template or wait?",
