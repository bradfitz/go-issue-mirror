Despite its name, it has no crypto guarantees.  Its only relation to AES is that it coopts assembly instructions that were originally designed to make AES faster.  AesHash's main features are that it is fast and that it passes SMHasher, a good (non-cryptographic) hash test suite.  A nice-to-have additional feature is that it can fold in some process startup randomness to thwart DoS attacks (In addtion to the per-map random seed that Ian mentioned).\r\n\r\nI intend to add some startup randomness to the new hash functions once they are in.  It should only require a judicious xor or two to add that in.\r\n\r\nSipHash-2-4 is about 4x slower on small keys and 10x slower on large keys than the new functions for 1.5.  (Comparing C versions of both)\r\n",
