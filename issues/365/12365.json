	"body": "The package `golang.org/x/net/internal/iana` contains many useful constants which could be very helpful for users outside of the `x/net` repository.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I wanted to implement my own IPv4 marshaling and unmarshaling package, I would have to write out a list by hand, or copy the entire list of protocol number constants from the `x/net/internal/iana` package anyway.\r\n\r\nIs there a strong argument for this package to remain internal?  Moving it to `x/net/iana` or similar would provide a great deal of value for a much larger number of users.  Because there cannot be external users of this package as-is, the change would only require updating import paths within the `x/net` packages.\r\n\r\n/cc @dominikh ",
