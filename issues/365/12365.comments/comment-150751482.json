If this package doesn't have all the numbers, then it is not well named. If it does have all the numbers, then I fear it will become unnavigable, perhaps worse even than syscall. Either choice seems like a serious problem.\n\nI also disagree that exposing the current package would \"provide a great deal of value\" for a significant number of users. And I think we're not set up well to manage the package.",
