The spec says that the\nmethod set of a struct includes all promoted methods, not all methods.  A promoted\nmethod is a method M such that v.M denotes that method.  In this case v.M denotes the\nembedded field, not the method.  So M should not be in the method set, and the\nassignment should fail.\n\nOf course we could decide that the spec is wrong, but I think the spec is plausible, and\nit follows that gccgo is in error.\n\nIt would be great if you could add this test to the testsuite.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **gccgo**, removed **priority-triage**._",
