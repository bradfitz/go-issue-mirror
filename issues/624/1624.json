	"body": "by **rbloomy6**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Run 'gofmt' without any arguments.\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nUsage information.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nPrints a newline, then (apparently) hangs.  I haven't left it running long enough to see\nif it actually finishes, but it shouldn't be taking that long to print out usage\ninformation.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nFedora 14\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n2a70fd529a01+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThe main() function in gofmt.go does include a check for \u0026quot;if flag.NArg == 0\u0026quot;,\nbut that block doesn't call the usage() function like it does in other programs (godoc\nat least does this).\u003c/pre\u003e",
