Wouldn't it be\nbetter to modify Reader.octal, or add a new Reader.numeric function, to decode the\nbinary value if the most significant bit is set?\n\nIf you do add extra checks to the Writer, I suggest you also return ErrFieldTooLong when\nlen(Header.Name) \u003e 100. Until support is added for longer file names, it's better to\nreport an error instead of silently truncating the value.\u003c/pre\u003e",
