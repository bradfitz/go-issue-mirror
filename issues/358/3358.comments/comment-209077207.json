I think even partial improvement with backwards compatibility is a success.\r\n\r\n@minux that's exactly the *magic* that I was talking about in my previous post. I agree that it would be nice to support relative paths etc, but that's not something I'm too excited about solving right now. Paths longer than MAX_PATH don't work right now at all. Adding support for long full paths seems easy and I don't think support for them should be held back by the lack of support for long relative paths. Again, I don't plan on changing behavior of paths shorter than MAX_PATH, so relative paths there will continue to work just fine.\r\n\r\nI haven't written the changes yet, they're only theoretical based on brief reviews of the Go source \u0026 my knowledge of the Windows API. I hope to get some practical testing done soon.",
