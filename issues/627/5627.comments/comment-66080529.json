Tail calls are an easy and high-level optimization to implement in a\ncompiler.  If you do not want this optimization to trigger in ordinary code for whatever\nreason, that is fine.  It is still relevant in the trampoline case.\n\nToday, the embedded trampolines are a source of fragility.  They are not generated by\nthe same means as other functions and because of that they not subject to analysis and\nannotations as other functions are.  If genwrapper can do the same work and generate as\ngood code, it will remove a big special case in the three backends. Our compiler will be\nsimpler and have fewer source lines of code to maintain.\u003c/pre\u003e",
