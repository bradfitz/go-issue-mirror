The only\nplace this comes up is in the embedded trampoline generator. I am sorry you\ntripped over it, but it is a tiny special case, not a big one. I count 200\nlines, maybe another 100 if it gets implemented in 5g. I doubt very much\nthat the amount of code you would have to add throughout the toolchain for\ntail call optimization would be smaller than 300 lines.\u003c/pre\u003e",
