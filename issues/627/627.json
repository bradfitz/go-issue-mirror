	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThis test has two parts: a simple python web server, and a go web client \nthat uses http.Post:\n\u003ca href=\"http://pastie.org/841123\"\u003ehttp://pastie.org/841123\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe python web server takes the post data and returns it in JSON format. \n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThe output is very choppy. I'm inclined to believe that there is a glitch \nwith Go's ReadResponse. \n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux/amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nrelease-02-24\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI wanted to create an issue to track it. It might not be a bug in Go, but \nsomething strange is happening.\u003c/pre\u003e",
