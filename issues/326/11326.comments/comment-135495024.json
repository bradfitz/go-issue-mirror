Cutting exponent size to 8 digits (mpatoflt in mparith3.go) is no longer needed.\r\n\r\nHowever, Float.SetString appears to not accept a full 32bit exponent:\r\n```\r\nvar g = 0.5e2147483647\r\n```\r\nleads to the error (after removing cutting the exponent size):\r\n```\r\nconstant too large: 0.5e2147483647\r\n```\r\nimplying that the constant internally turned into a (Float) infinity. Keep this open for now.\r\n",
