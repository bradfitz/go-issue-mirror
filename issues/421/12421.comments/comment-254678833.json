I noticed that \"ah, Active Directory and a few directory service implementations do support Net-Unicode for unicast DNS\" when I saw #16739. As far as I know, https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnssd-mdns-dns-interop is the active informational document  that addresses interoperability issues with multiple types of DNS-labels.
