My understanding is that it should reject !!!.local and NOT try the lookup.\r\n\r\n2) Should the rejection say 'invalid domain name' or 'no such host'? It seems fine to change to say 'no such host' to match cgo.\r\n\r\nSo I would suggest for Go 1.8 we simply change the path that fails on isDomainName to return 'no such host' instead of 'invalid domain name', to match netdns=cgo mode.\r\n",
