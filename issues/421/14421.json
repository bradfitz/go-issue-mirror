	"body": "For e.g. \"%020f\" Inf is not 0 padded but NaN is.\r\n\r\n```\r\n00000000000000000NaN\r\n                +Inf\r\n                -Inf\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/qiO-mme4S6\r\n\r\nThere is no test case for 0 padded NaN (but for Inf) and it seems this behavior has existed throughout Go 1.x .\r\nC does not 0 pad NaN and Infs which seemed the reason the Infs are treated special in Go too.\r\n\r\nThis might not be changed anymore due to the Go 1 guarantees but the API documentation does not seem to explicitly mention the treatment for NaN or Inf either.\r\n\r\nNot sure if it should just be document or if this should be fixed for 1.7 \r\nIf ok i can submit a patch that just adds a test case for current Go behavior with a comment that references this issue or make the treatment of NaN consistent with Inf.",
