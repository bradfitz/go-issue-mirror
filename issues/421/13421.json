	"body": "this merely simplifies the interface a bit (no change in functionality) and makes further connection to the io package, which seems appropriate:\r\n\r\n    type File interface {\r\n            io.Closer\r\n            io.Reader\r\n            io.Seeker // ADD THIS\r\n            Readdir(count int) ([]os.FileInfo, error)\r\n            // Seek(offset int64, whence int) (int64, error) // REMOVE THIS\r\n            Stat() (os.FileInfo, error)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nnot sure if there are any policy reasons why this change couldn't be made, like strict api compatibility, etc.\r\n",
