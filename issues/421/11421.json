	"body": "Go's int type size is platform dependent.\r\nJava's int type is always 32bit. \r\nGobind currently maps 'int' to 'long' type to have a consistent api while dealing with 64bit values that may return from Go. \r\n\r\nOn 32bit platform this can be problematic if the Java API passes larger than the 32bit int max. Generating a different API depending on the platform is not an option, but we need a way to limit the value that can be passed into Go depending on the platform.\r\n",
