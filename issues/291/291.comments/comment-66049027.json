In fact it would be a more\nverbose version of an \nexisting feature.\n\nThe var keyword has use in clarifying the syntax outside of functions and occasionally\nto be clear about variables \nthat will be assigned later.  Using it inside the init clause of a for loop is needless.\n\nThere's just no need for this change in idiomatic Go code.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
