I just\ntried to repro #13 on OS X and got the following:\n\n/var/log/systemlog:\nprocess issue7582[3042] caught causing excessive wakeups. Observed wakeups rate (per\nsec): 10143; Maximum permitted wakeups rate (per sec): 150; Observation period: 300\nseconds; Task lifetime number of wakeups: 45005\n\nSo certainly adding time.Sleep(an appropriate value) into the for-loop appears a\ndifferent result, but not sure what we could do for quicker spinning applications on OS\nX 10.9 and beyond.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: removed **release-go1.3**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **HelpWanted**._",
