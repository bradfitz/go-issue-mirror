Make a package / command that uses cgo\n2. go test -i\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nNo output to console, but $GOPATH/pkg/ should have dependent packages installed into it.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\ncan't load package: C: package could not be found locally\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\ndarwin/x86 (Mac OS X 10.6.8)\n\nWhich revision are you using?
