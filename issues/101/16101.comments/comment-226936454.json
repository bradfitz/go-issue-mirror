I started implementing the `block` template functionality and it appears to operate as expected when using it with standard content templates. Whenever I attempt to use it with taxonomies, it crashes almost every time with the error attached to the Hugo issue.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I cannot make the repo for the site open to the public due to legal limitations. But I will be glad to assist with the investigation however I can.",
