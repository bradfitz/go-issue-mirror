The defer fmt.Println is never executed\n3. Why? The spec says that defer will be executed at the end of the function.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThe behavior is good, but the documentation should mention this case.\nruntimer.Goexit() which could have a similar behavior specifies that it calls all the\ndeferred calls. We should tell that os.Exit doesn't call them.\n\nPlease use labels and text to provide additional information.\u003c/pre\u003e",
