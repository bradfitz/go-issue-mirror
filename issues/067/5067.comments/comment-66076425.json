As I\nunderstand it, the problem is that the OpenBSD 5.3 GCC passes -pie by default, and using\n-nopie turns that off.  Unfortunately the OpenBSD 5.2 GCC does not understand -nopie. \nThe object generated by 6l is neither PIC nor PIE and therefore can not be used when\nlinking with -pie.  So, trouble all around.\n\nOne remote possibility would be to modify the linker to support a variant of flag_shared\nthat would produce a PIC object without passing -shared to the external linker. \nProbably not for 1.2, though.\u003c/pre\u003e",
