The program has a few loops that setup the initial\ndata which is then saved over and over again. I've made the loop sizes as small as I\ncan, while still having the program fail. It is possible that someone with different\nmemory or hardware will need to adjust the loop counts. Basically err on the side of big.\n\nFailure is consistent. If it fails once it will always fail.\n\nOne thing that is weird, the data file that is successfully written is very small\n\u0026lt;300 bytes. My sense is that the object being saved should be much bigger.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2067/1/main.go\"\u003emain.go\u003c/a\u003e (1511 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2067/1/gobble.txt\"\u003egobble.txt\u003c/a\u003e (1660 bytes)",
