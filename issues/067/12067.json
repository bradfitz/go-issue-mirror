	"body": "Commit f5d494b introduced a publication barrier in the runtime, which was implemented using an ARMv7-only instruction on non-Linux OSs. As a result, Go crashes on non-Linux platforms with pre-ARMv7 CPUs (such as the original Raspberry Pi). Prior to this change, Go imposed no constraints on the ARM versions supported by specific OS targets and we should restore that support.\r\n\r\nThis was reported on golang-dev in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/49Rnvr7eSxo/JSEdxjrUBwAJ and in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/YMjDVctVpkw/lZJkgHFUeTYJ.\r\n\r\n@rsc ",
