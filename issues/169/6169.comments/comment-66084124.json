But it *is* triggered;\nthat is, the \"unexpected packet\" error I mentioned above in `channel.go` is hit (it's\njust that sshpool now works around it, like it works around connectivity errors).\n\nI filed a bug because \"unexpected packet\" presumably means that a violation of some\ninternal contract is being hit: this doesn't seem like an error that a user should ever\nsee with a well-behaved client.\n\nI'll tweak a branch of sshpool to actually print this error.\u003c/pre\u003e",
