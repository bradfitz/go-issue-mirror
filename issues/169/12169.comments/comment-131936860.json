Each sensor.Manager allocates several underlying resources.\r\n\r\nWe debated finalization vs Closer interface a couple of times in different contexts for the mobile project.  In this particular case, I would prefer not to implement io.Closer because  it is fine not to have a guarantee -- the leak is not expensive. The only concern is the unexpected finalizations as it was the case at https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10636. sensor.Manager instances are likely to be long-living, similar to al.Context.",
