	"body": "runtime/debug.WriteHeapDump's godocs link to https://golang.org/s/go15heapdump, but that describes a file format that starts with \"go1.5 heap dump\\n\".\r\n\r\nCurrently, runtime.dumphdr is \"go1.7 heap dump\\n\".  Before 30f93f09, it was \"go1.6 heap dump\\n\".  So that's at least two revisions to the heap dump file format that are undocumented.\r\n\r\nRelevant because https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/21647/1 might change the heap dump format again.\r\n\r\n/cc @crawshaw ",
