But  it seems to me that it might be more difficult to track a specific time (say escape analysis) if some of the other phases move around. Also, it would seem more difficult to attach bytes (to compute things like source bytes parsed/time unit, etc.).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, simpler is often better. Maybe it is good enough to just track transition times. Still exploring.",
