That's why I was thinking of using names like \"typecheck\" instead of \"phase1\" or \"phase2\", so that the name could remain meaningful long-term even if we end up reorganizing how the specific phase boundaries.\r\n\r\n@griesemer Okay, yeah, that's a little more code (explicitly marking begin/end of each phase rather than making it implicit by just marking transitions), but sounds roughly isomorphic to what I was thinking.",
