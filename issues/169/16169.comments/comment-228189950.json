I worry that while optimizing one phase decisions might get made that impact other phases without getting noticed. In particular, frontend/backend interactions can be like this. As a concrete example, I have a CL waiting for 1.8 that removes some empty goto-label pairs that were introduced as a frontend convenience, the removal of which cuts overall compiler allocation by 1%.",
