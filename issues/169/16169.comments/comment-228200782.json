	"body": "With \"structured API\" I didn't mean large framework. At the moment it's about 75 lines of code, with minimal code (one-liners) at measuring points in the front-end. The grouping mostly removes the need to think much about label names: Basically, introducing a new subgroup is a local operation; no need to rename other labels. For instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar stats = NewGroup(\"compilation of ...\") // initialize compiler stats, a group of measurements\r\n...\r\nparse := stats.AddTiming(\"parse\") // create a start a new time measurement\r\n// parser invocations\r\nparse.Stop()\r\n...\r\nphase1 := stats.AddTiming(\"phase1\")\r\n...\r\nphase1.Stop()\r\n```\r\netc. A bit more code than you suggest. \r\n\r\n",
