	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe GDB plugin provides a \u0026quot;goroutine\u0026quot; command so that we can do: \u0026quot;info\ngoroutines\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;goroutine 1 bt\u0026quot;.\n\nGDB provides \u0026quot;info threads\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;thread apply 1 bt\u0026quot; similarly, but also\n\u0026quot;thread apply all bt\u0026quot; which is nice.\n\nIt seems that an option to view all backtraces would be useful, because in most\nsituations most goroutines are blocked waiting and looking for a particular goroutine is\nhard. It could be called \u0026quot;goroutine all bt\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;goroutine apply all\nbt\u0026quot;.\u003c/pre\u003e",
