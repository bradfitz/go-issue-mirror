	"title": "proposal: testing: programmatic sub-test and sub-benchmark support",
	"body": "Support for table-driven tests and benchmarks could be improved by allowing subtests and subbenchmarks to be spawned programmatically by allowing, for example, a Run method on T and B in the testing package. This would enable various use cases, such as:\r\n\r\n* an easy way to single out tests and benchmarks in a table from the command line (e.g. for debugging),\r\n* simplify writing a collection of similar benchmarks,\r\n* use of Fatal in sub tests without halting sibling subtests,\r\n* eliminate need to prefix each error message in a test with its subtest name, resulting in more consistent and simpler to write error messages,\r\n* creating subtests from an external/dynamic table source,\r\n* more control over scope of setup and teardown (more than TestMain allows now), and\r\n* more control over parallelism.\r\n\r\nSemantically, subtests and subbenchmarks would behave exactly the same as the current top-level counterparts. In fact, the top-level counterparts could be implemented as subtests/benchmarks of a single root.  Details would need to be worked out in a design doc.",
