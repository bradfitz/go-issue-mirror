	"body": "@robzan8: @minux is correct - the wording was chosen such that shift operators fit in neatly. Note that (untyped constants aside), operands of arithmetic operators must be of the same type - with the notable exception of shifts. The wording is fine.\r\n\r\nThere's always different ways to phrase this, and we are not claiming this is the best way. But as is it's correct.\r\n\r\nHere's your example:\r\n```\r\nvar x int\r\nvar s uint\r\n...\r\nresult := x \u003c\u003c s\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThe type of result is the type of x, not the type of s. That is, the type of the left operand is the one that's relevant.\r\n\r\nPlease drop further discussion of this here. If you have a better suggestion that doesn't conflict elsewhere in the spec, please send a change. Thanks.\r\n",
