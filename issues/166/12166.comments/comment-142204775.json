	"body": "@ChrisHines: a commonly suggested alternative approach using the existing testing package is to write functions and then top-level testing functions that simply pass parameters. This gets most of the functionality, but results in considerably larger and more awkward code. It is possible to generate such code, but this is not necessarily less awkward. I'll update the doc.\r\nNote that this change would mostly add syntax to the existing system. I merely define the semantics more precisely. In my trial implementation, top-level tests are just subtests of a \"main\" test and the framework calls Run for them under the hood.\r\n\r\nSee https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/2322/4/unicode/norm/normalize_test.go for a rather elaborate example. For example, the benchmark code is considerably shorter and more data-driven.\r\n\r\nThe use of Run for tests in this CL is excessive and unnecessary but was done to explore its boundaries a bit. ",
