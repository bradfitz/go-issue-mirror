For example, this gives the same result:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nfunc testLabelScope() {\r\n\tvar err error\r\n\terr = errors.New(\"Should not exist\")\r\n\t{\r\n\t\terr := errors.New(\"What is this?\");\r\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Err: %s\\n\", err)\r\n\t}\r\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Err: %s\\n\", err)\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIn this case I'd expect a build error. I'm not sure that allowing variable redecleration in inner scopes is... fine. You can see and modify outer scope variables, but as soon as you declare a variable in the inner scope, you can't modify the one in the outer one. It's... confusing.",
