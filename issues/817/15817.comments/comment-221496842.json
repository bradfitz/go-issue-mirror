I threw up a small program just to test it, and oh my... :)\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nint main() {\r\n    int pos, offset;\r\n    int x;\r\n    for (x=0; x \u003c 3; x++) {\r\n        offset = x;\r\n        printf(\"x %d \", x);\r\n        int x;\r\n        for (x=0; x \u003c 3; x++) {\r\n            pos = offset + (x*3);\r\n            printf(\"y %d (%d) \", x, pos);\r\n        }\r\n        printf(\"ex %d\\n\", x);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n@kostya-sh thank you for info about `go vet`, i'll look into it - seems like a good pre-build step if you're trying to discourage variable shadowing. Global-vs-function scope is easier to control just by keeping global scope clean, but inside function blocks I expect I'll be having a few more hard to find bugs in my future, as you had ;)\r\n",
