My program exited (some times )with the next error\nmessage:\n\nparsing \u0026quot;in\u0026quot;: invalid syntax\n\nbut to find that it was by strconv.Atoi was very hard because looking for \u0026quot;in\u0026quot;\ninto a files with more than 1000 lines is a waste of time ;)\nIn fact, at the beginning, I thought that it was by the template parser but it didn't,\nmy second option was looking in code related to flag and nothing.\n\nResuming, it has been a waste of time that could be solved if that error had:\n\nstrconv.[Function] besides of the error message.\u003c/pre\u003e",
