We should definitely support Go 1.1 though, since\ntoday that is the stable release, and we need to give folk enough time after the Go 1.2\nrelease to migrate to that.\n\nWhat parts of go.net/ipv6 don't work on Go 1.1? If it's only a small part of that\npackage we should stub them out.\u003c/pre\u003e",
