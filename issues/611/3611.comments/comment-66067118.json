Is the best practice to use a\nmutex to control access to the rand I create?\n\nAdditionally, couldn't the code in rng.go be made goroutine-safe (preventing tap and\nfeed from jumping off the end of the vector) by doing the decrement and range fix\nagainst a local variable?\n\n\ttap := rng.tap -1\n\tif tap \u0026lt; 0 {\n\t\ttap += _LEN\n\t}\n\trng.tap = tap\n\n\tfeed := rng.feed -1\n\tif feed \u0026lt; 0 {\n\t\tfeed += _LEN\n\t}\n\trng.feed = feed\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
