That is not promised to work, and it turns out does not.\nIf you are actually calling the top-level function rand.Int63 and it\nis crashing, then that's a bug on our part and we should investigate\nfurther.  Please let us know which it is.\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
