Â Is the best practice\n: to use a mutex to control access to the rand I create?\n\nYes, using a mutex is the right solution, or call the package's\ntop-level Intn function.\n\n: Additionally, couldn't the code in rng.go be made goroutine-safe (preventing\n: tap and feed from jumping off the end of the vector) by doing the decrement\n: and range fix against a local variable?\n\nThe rewrite would probably work, but you still have the problem that\nsimultaneous calls to Intn are returning the same value.  Also, an\noptimizing compiler would be allowed to rewrite your new code into the\nold code.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
