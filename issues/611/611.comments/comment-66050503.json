But that I suspect is some time away.\n\nFirst, there's some porting to do, and I think 6l and 8l might be the easy parts. \nFiguring out the best choices for threading and semaphore interfaces inside the\nruntime package is my current area of work.  So far as I know, none of the interfaces\nused in the OS X (Darwin), FreeBSD, or Linux ports are available natively in NetBSD,\nand using (say) the Linux implementation via NetBSD kernel emulation seems like a bad\nidea.\n\nFYI I'm working on NetBSD-5.0.  Given the threading changes introduced in 5.0\nstarting there seemed best.  I'll be happy if 4.0 can also be supported, but would\nvalue a \"better\" 5.0 port over a less good port which also supported 4.0.\u003c/pre\u003e",
