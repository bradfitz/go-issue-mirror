We could install via ISO or\nsimply a dd of a compressed image. Let me double check a few things and get\nback to you on which is easiest.\n\nIf we go the pre-installed image route, you will need to do a few things:\n* Make sure you support KVM virtio devices or specify which devices you will\nneed (e1000 for nic works well for example)\n* Make sure to support ACPI for powerbutton events.\"\n\n\nI imagine it'll be easiest if we just give them an image, and don't make them go through\nthe install process for us.  It would also be good to host somewhere so we can re-setup\nthe builder hermetically later, from install instructions.\u003c/pre\u003e",
