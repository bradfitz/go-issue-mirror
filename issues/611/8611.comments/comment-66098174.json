E.g., from the Clang 3.0 _cgo_.o, we can't\ndistinguish whether the field should have type \"[3][0][1][2]C.char\" or\n\"[3][1][0][2]C.char\".  Arguably either would be better than \"[0][1][1][2]C.char\", but I\ndon't think it makes sense to further complicate debug/dwarf if we can't guarantee a\ncorrect answer.\n\nI suspect the best solution unfortunately is to simply disable\nmisc/cgo/test/issue8428.go on older OS X with buggy versions of Clang.  According to\n\u003ca href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8674546/how-to-update-llvm-clang-on-mac-osx\"\u003ehttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/8674546/how-to-update-llvm-clang-on-mac-osx\u003c/a\u003e, that\nseems to be OS X Lion (Clang 3.0) and OS X Mountain Lion (Clang 3.2).\n\nIs it possible to use +build rules to skip particular versions of a platform?  Or should\nI just skip all of darwin for issue8428.go?\u003c/pre\u003e",
