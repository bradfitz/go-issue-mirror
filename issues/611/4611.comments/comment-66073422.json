So\nthis would slow down atomic store operations for little benefit.\n\nYou can write\n    var old T\n    for {\n        old = *p\n        if atomic.CompareAndSwapT(p, old, new) {\n            break\n        }\n    }\n    // Now *p was atomically set to new\n    // and old is the value that used to be in *p.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
