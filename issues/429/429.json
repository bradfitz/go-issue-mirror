	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Run \u003ca href=\"http://pastie.org/743777\"\u003ehttp://pastie.org/743777\u003c/a\u003e\n2. In order to output go code, you have to replace all brackets with \n{.meta-left} and {.meta-right} . This gets annoying really quickly. It's \nprobably the same if you're template is source code. \n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThe template language shouldn't use simple brackets as default \nmetacharacters.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux/386\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\na33ae1785d42+ (+=\u0017=\u0026lt;) tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThere's a template language that's similar to json-template called mustache \n. \u003ca href=\"http://github.com/defunkt/mustache\"\u003ehttp://github.com/defunkt/mustache\u003c/a\u003e . It's picked up some momentum in the \nruby community. In that language, meta-characters are double brackets '{{' \nand '}}'. It also supports the ability to change metacharacters. \n\nI think something like mustache would be a good fit for the go std lib; I'd \nbe willing to implement it if you're interested.\u003c/pre\u003e",
