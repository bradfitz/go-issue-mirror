The custom HTTP server in comment #6's main.go startApp actually\nreplies before it receives a request.\n\nThe numExpectedReplies++ in transport.go is already very early: it's before we even ask\nthe writeLoop to write the request.\n\nIf the server replies before we even try to write a request, the server really is\nspeaking out of turn. Looks working as intended to me.\n\nWhat am I missing?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.3maybe**, removed **release-go1.3**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
