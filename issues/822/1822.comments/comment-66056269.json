I'm working under the assumption that it's because panicindex was never\nreached, but I have no hard evidence.\n\nNow, the program still hangs but after making it to the next method that gets called (q\nis still []*C.zmq_pollitem_t, as is d.a). I've attached the full method and its assembly\noutput. Though it's reported as being on line 226, there's a call to runtime.new and it\nlooks like that's where it's hanging, based on my previous post. \n\nLike I said, will try to make a minimal test case later.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1822/7/drain.S\"\u003edrain.S\u003c/a\u003e (16147 bytes)",
