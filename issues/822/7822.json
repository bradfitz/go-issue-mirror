	"body": "\u003cpre\u003ego version devel +70af843fed44 Sat Apr 19 09:55:09 2014 +0200 darwin/amd64\n\nI am using the ReverseProxy, and 90% of the time, I can get a Unsolicited response\nreceived on idle HTTP channel starting with \u0026quot;H\u0026quot;; err=\u0026lt;nil\u0026gt;\n\nThe problem is pretty easy to see once you walk transport.RoundTrip().\nThere is no guarantee that numExpectedResponses is incremented in pconn.RoundTrip()\nbefore pconn.ReadLoop() executes.\n\ntransport.dialConn() starts the pconn.readLoop() goroutine and returns which releases\ntransport.getConn() which then calls pconn.RoundTrip().\nIf the peek() in readLoop is slow, you won't ever see this problem, but I am not so\nlucky.\n\nLooks like the easiest/safest fix is to either move numExpectedResponses++ or just set\nit to 1.\u003c/pre\u003e",
