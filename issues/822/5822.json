	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eShould we use clang instead of gcc for the OS X build? It seems increasingly clear that\nApple's focus on clang means the gcc in Xcode is being left behind.\n\nFor example it has been true for at least a year now that gcc -O2 -Wall does not report\nuse of uninitialized variables. The back end converts them to ud2a and the code crashes\nat run time. Compiling with clang does report them. (The underlying bug appears to be\nthat the gcc back end assumes the clang front end reported them.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
