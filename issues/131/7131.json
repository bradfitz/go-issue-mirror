The dependencies()\ndepth-first traversal in go/types that populates InitOrder relies upon the assumption\nthat the init.deps map is iterated in source order so that pairs of elements that are\nnot ordered according to the graph (partial) order are ordered according to the source\n(total) order.  This assumption was true with the old toolchain as long as the map was\nsmall, but is no longer.\u003c/pre\u003e",
