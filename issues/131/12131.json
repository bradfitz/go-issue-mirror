	"body": "From https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/master/ssh/common.go#L52\r\n\r\n    \"This is based on RFC 4253, section 6.4, but with hmac-md5 variants\r\n     removed because they have reached the end of their useful life.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is wishful thinking. ssh servers should not use old ciphers,\r\nbut sometimes they do, and we still need to manage them. Sometimes we \r\nhave no control over the server implementation -- in this instance it's \r\nMikrotik routers. Deprecated ciphers are still useful in this circumstance\r\neven though in an ideal world this would not be the case.\r\n\r\nI'd work on making a patch, but as this appears to be a conscious choice\r\nI want to check here first to make sure I'm not wasting my time if it would\r\nbe rejected out of hand.",
