I'd like to understand it once and for all.\r\n\r\nMost Windows programs call CommandLineToArgvW WinAPI (or similar) to parse input parameters. Go does too. Go also has syscall.EscapeArg to do the opposite - convert []string into command line string. The syscall.EscapeArg doc also has some references.\r\n\r\nSome Windows programs use different rules for encoding []string into command line. Most notably cmd.exe and msiexec.exe (see #15566 for details).\r\n\r\nAlex",
