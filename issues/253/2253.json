	"body": "by **branimirkaradzic**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nTo reproduce the bug, you have to run TLS server and then open two browser windows and\npoint one to:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://localhost:443/\"\u003ehttp://localhost:443/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nAnd other to:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://localhost/\"\u003ehttps://localhost/\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nI expect that connection on the first one gets rejected and closed as\nsoon as server figures out that protocol is not HTTPS, and that other\none just works.\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nServer becomes unresponsive.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nLinux\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\nversion: release.r60 9481\nb0819469a6df (release-branch.r60) release/release.r60\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nHere is simple code to reproduce the bug:\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n        \u0026quot;http\u0026quot;\n)\n\nfunc index(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {\n\n        w.Write([]byte(\u0026quot;Hello!\u0026quot;))\n\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\n        http.HandleFunc(\u0026quot;/\u0026quot;, index)\n        server := \u0026amp;http.Server{Addr: \u0026quot;:443\u0026quot;, Handler: nil, ReadTimeout: 10 *\n1e9, WriteTimeout: 10 * 1e9}\n        server.ListenAndServeTLS(\u0026quot;cert.pem\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;key.pem\u0026quot;)\n\n}\u003c/pre\u003e",
