It's from [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/dfded57819dd9111afffc25360cd3e147859d354/src/net/http/transport.go#L1286).\r\n\r\nAlso it would be nice that `http.Transport` allows taking a `log.Logger` (like `httputil.ReverseProxy`) so that we can use our custom logger and don't easily miss any error emitted on transport (we log errors in certain format for better query).",
