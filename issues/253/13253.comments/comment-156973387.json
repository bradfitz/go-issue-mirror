But I'm still not quite sure what conclusion you or @btracey are trying to draw from this.\r\n\r\nSo in numpy ndarray or torch tensor, you can take non-contiguous views (eg column in a row major matrix), and you can reshape arbitrarily - but the price you pay is that reshape may have to take a copy of (part of) the data. (An alternative design decision would have been for reshape to throw an error when called on a non-contiguous view, thus forcing the user to explicitly clone() in that case. However, both numpy and torch have chosen the implicit copy route.)\r\n\r\nSo one option in the design space is to support non-contiguous views and reshape, and put up with this limitation in how they interact. But I suppose another option is to disallow one (or both) out of non-contiguous views and reshape. Is this what you and/or @btracey prefer?",
