Another symptom is pointed out in my original comment here. The theme is that copy-free view-based algorithms are only possible when width equals stride, blocking a whole swag of things that are very useful. Even when copying is allowed, the copy from the view is tricky as is the copy back. In the end, you need to bolt on a width field and you end up pretty much exactly where we are right now for everything except for the stride equals width case.\n",
