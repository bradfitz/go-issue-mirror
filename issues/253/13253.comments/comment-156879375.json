	"body": "I think that a slice expression with two values should reduce the arity. For example, if `ss` has type `[*][*]T`, the expression `ss[:]` would return a strided slice `[*]T`, and `ss[:][:]` would return a slice with all the elements. This would make reshaping trivial: `ss[:][:]*[m]*[n]`. Some sugar would be needed for the usual case `ss[i:j]*[stride(ss)]` (which is the case covered now by the proposal).\r\n\r\nI agree with other people that there must be a better syntax, but I like the concept and really appreciate that some thought is being given to this problem.",
