There seems to be\nsome bug in the 8l/6l linkers WRT mach-o files when statically linking files compiled\nwith -fcommon (the default option).\n\nUnfortunately using \"CGO_CFLAGS=-fno-common\" doesn't solve the solution for me though,\nbecause for the above code, and in my own sample I now get:\n\nmalformed mach-o file: unsupported scattered relocation 2/1\n\nWhich is an error similar to when I try to link to objective-c code (to interact with\nOSX) this is a known problem with go in Snow Leopard on 386 (the last version of OSX to\nsupport 386).\n\nAlthough the above problem (failing to link on Lion) could be solved by adding\n-fno-common to the link flags for all gcc compile tasks, this may result in trading one\nset of uncompilable code for another.\u003c/pre\u003e",
