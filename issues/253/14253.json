	"body": "the `rectangle.Dx()` returns `r.Max.X - r.Min.X` while it should return `r.Max.X - r.Min.X + 1` \r\nhttps://golang.org/src/image/geom.go?s=2215:2242#L85\r\n\r\nIt is not just the `Dx()` and `Dy()`. In the image package in all the places that I've checked, the `Bounds()` and related functions return the top left as `(0,0)` but put right bottom corner at `(width, height)` when they should put it at `(width-1, height-1)`.\r\nHave I missed something in the docs? Checking the color values using `At(x,y)` shows that the color (at least for JPEG images) at `(width, height) is black, while the color at `(width-1, height-1)` is a reasonable color from the image. \r\n\r\n",
