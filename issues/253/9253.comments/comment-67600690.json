It depends on Windows' implementation but icmp.ParseIPv4Header must handle correctly even if Windows stack tweaks a few fields of original IPv4 header in ICMP error message, such as Darwin and FreeBSD.\r\n\r\nYou can use ping_test.go with a small modification, just using ipv4.PacketConn.SetTTL, to send a TTL=1 ICMP packet and to receive an ICMP time exceeded error message on Window.",
