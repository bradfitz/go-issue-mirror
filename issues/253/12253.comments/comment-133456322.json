It's only happened once, I've been tracking master on and off for months. This process instance ran for ~13 hours before this happened. I've used that go version previously. I dont use cgo or unsafe in any of my code, and I don't think any of my dependencies do.\r\n\r\nThe process is a server, and I don't know what triggered it. But if you have any good guesses I can try to run those code paths.",
