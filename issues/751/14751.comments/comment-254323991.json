And when you live in a `template` world where everything is an `interface{}` I think it is up to the helper funcs to **help** avoiding a mess of nested conditionals.\r\n\r\nYou cannot write:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n{{if lt 0 (len .B)}}{{index .B .C}}{{else}}Not Found{{end}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout knowing that `.B` is a `slice` and `.C` is an `int`. \r\n\r\n`index` knows this and should be able to take advantage of that to *help* the end user.",
