	"body": "(This new issue extracts a sub-issue that was originally mentioned in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/5128#issuecomment-66076842. After investigating the cause, I've realized this issue is different and smaller in scope than the original issue #5128, that's why I'm making this new issue.)\r\n\r\nAn instance of `gofmt` not being idempotent. Repeatedly invoking `gofmt` will add a level of indent to the `b string` line each time:\r\n\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/Pwn4cOHtMN\r\n\r\nI've identified the root cause in `go/printer` package (therefore the bug affects `cmd/gofmt`, `go/format` and `go/printer` packages). It's due to an unhandled edge case in [`stripCommonPrefix`](http://gotools.org/go/printer#stripCommonPrefix) func.\r\n\r\nIt happens when a comment block consists of a first line with `/*`, 1 or more blank lines, last line with `*/`. The internal `prefix` variable ends up never being set to a correct value before being used (it's not set at all, so it always has  zero value, the empty string). See https://github.com/golang/go/issues/5128#issuecomment-72396821 for more details.\r\n\r\nI already have a fix and test cases done locally, I will submit a CL that closes this issue shortly.",
