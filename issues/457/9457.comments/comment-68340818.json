As far as I remember we needed to have as many threads as possible in the early Go days. Our net package didn't use IOCP back then, so we had to use separate threads for different connections. windows/386 was our only platform so we could only have 2000 threads if their stack was 1M. I don't think this is an issue any more, especially on windows/amd64. Perhaps we could increase stacks now, but by how much?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I forget something else. But, I am sure, if we change stack sizes we will discover it :-)\r\n\r\nAlex",
