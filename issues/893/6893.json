	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eGo source files are UTF-8 so there is, in principle, no need to specify its encoding or\nlanguage. However, I think there is one case when it would be very convenient to specify\nin which language are the comments written.\n\nWhen using CJK (Chinese, Japanese and Korean), there are different variations of some\nideograms that are written with different glyphs (sometimes differences are minor,\nsometimes not so minor). However, in Unicode, some of these varied glyphs share the same\ncodepoint, so it is not possible to choose the right glyph if the language is unknown.\nThis is called the Han Unification: \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification\u003c/a\u003e\n\nHTML code can include the \u0026lt;lang\u0026gt; label to inform the browser which font should it\nuse to render a text. If it is not included, the browser usually will use a default\nfont. For example, Google Chrome on a non-CJK system will usually choose a Chinese font,\nand Japanese ideograms will be rendered with Chinese glyphs.\n\nSo my suggestion would be to include some kind of label for godoc to include the right\n\u0026lt;lang\u0026gt; label in the HTML generated, so it will be rendered correctly in most\nsystems. \n\nIdeally, it should be possible to modify it inside a file, so you could write Chinese\nand Japanese in the same file.\n\nWhat do you think?\u003c/pre\u003e",
