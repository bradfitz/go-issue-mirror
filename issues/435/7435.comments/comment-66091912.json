I'm surprised you don't see\nany difference.  For 1024 bytes 1.4 will use SSE and 1.3 uses REP MOVSQ.  I see the\nlatter in your numbers.  \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/90500043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/90500043\u003c/a\u003e is the submit that\nchanged the behavior.\n\nThis is exactly what I missed and confused me, I checked the history of memmove_amd64.s\nto make sure I didn't make that mistake (that the implementation being changed between\n1.3.3 and tip). However, I missed that MOVOU is actually MOVDQA, making me dismiss it as\n\"probably not SSE\". The folder change between 1.3.3 and tip allowed this commit to be\ndifficult to find as well:\n\ntip: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/jnwhiteh/golang/commits/master/src/runtime/memmove_amd64.s\"\u003ehttps://github.com/jnwhiteh/golang/commits/master/src/runtime/memmove_amd64.s\u003c/a\u003e (note\nthe missing history)\n1.3.3:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/jnwhiteh/golang/commits/release-branch.go1.3/src/pkg/runtime/memmove_amd64.s\"\u003ehttps://github.com/jnwhiteh/golang/commits/release-branch.go1.3/src/pkg/runtime/memmove_amd64.s\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI hope this is handled better in the original Mercurial repository of the code :).\n\nSo yes, these things are obvious from my results: the new copy() implementation in tip\nis competitive with aligned SSE movaps instructions, which is great.\n\n@khr: do you have an Ivy Bridge or newer? As I mentioned in my first post, those have\nenhanced MOVSB/STOSB (_not_ MOVSQ/MOVSQ, those are still slow) instructions which I\nthink would be fun to test (I left them commented in the code I pasted above).
