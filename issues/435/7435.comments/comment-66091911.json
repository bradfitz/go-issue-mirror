Here's what I get on my mac (tip):\n\nBenchmarkCopy\t100000000\t        22.0 ns/op\nBenchmarkMyCopy\t100000000\t        19.9 ns/op\nBenchmarkSimpleCopy\t50000000\t        34.2 ns/op\n\nSo the built-in copy is just a bit slower than straight-line, aligned sse moves.  Simple\ncopy (REP MOVSQ) is quite a bit slower.\n\nTip and 1.3 should be quite different in this respect.  I'm surprised you don't see any\ndifference.  For 1024 bytes 1.4 will use SSE and 1.3 uses REP MOVSQ.  I see the latter\nin your numbers.  \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/90500043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/90500043\u003c/a\u003e is the submit that changed the\nbehavior.\u003c/pre\u003e",
