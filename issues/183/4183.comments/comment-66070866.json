Used linuxmint-201204-mate-cinnamon-dvd-64bit.iso and simply\nran it as a Live image, no tuning. VMWare virtual machine setup:\n  * 1GB\n  * 2 Processors, 2 Cores/processor (total cores: 4)\n  * HDD: 20GB\n\nnote that curl will get HTTP 200 OK, but when the problem arises, it gets no body back.\n\nnginx log will show intermittent Connection reset by peer errors. Sometimes longer\nslightly longer than 10s, but usually with 20s.\n\nI ran the fcgi handler with: GOMAXPROCS=2 ./fcgi3\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4183/14/go-fcgi-nginx.tgz\"\u003ego-fcgi-nginx.tgz\u003c/a\u003e (5288306 bytes)",
