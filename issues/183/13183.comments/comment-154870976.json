	"body": "You don't want it to be *solely* the responsibility of the goroutine itself because a common pattern is to have a top-level loop that blocks on a channel and when it receives something, use a bunch of stack, then unwind the stack, then block again. Since it could be blocked for a long time, you either need it to shrink its stack on the way in to the receive (very hard to predict when this is worthwhile) or you need something else to be able to shrink its stack when it has been blocked for a long time, which gets us right back to the problem of stack shrinking racing with a channel receive.",
