My last attempt (CL 2118), however,\nfailed to eliminate all the special casing in the linker (actually you can\nargue\nthat it made it worse because subsequent CLs added more special case\ncode to fix the android/arm builder).\n\nThe situation is so bad that in the darwin/arm64 port, I have to avoid the\nruntime.tlsg name altogether.\n\nI filed #10560 to remember to do the clean up and fix the arm64 problem.\n",
