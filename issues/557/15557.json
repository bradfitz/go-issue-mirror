It is retained for compatibility with the Go 1 API promise. See https://golang.org/s/frozen-package for details.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then at that URL we can spell out the rules more. (e.g. maybe we'll accept actual bug fixes if they're obviously wrong and don't change buggy behavior that people might depend on)\r\n\r\n/cc @adg @rsc @ianlancetaylor ",
