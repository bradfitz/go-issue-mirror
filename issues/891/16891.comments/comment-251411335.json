Are you perhaps accidentally trying to use pprof with the binary from 1.6.2 but a profile from 1.7, or vice versa? You need to explicitly generate the binary with `go test -o foo.exe` before you can run pprof; maybe you did that once and it's hanging around in your directory, but you didn't do it again when you switched to 1.7?\r\n\r\nNote that there is indeed profile information in the file you sent:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go tool pprof broken.prof \r\nEntering interactive mode (type \"help\" for commands)\r\n(pprof) addresses\r\n(pprof) top10\r\n3260ms of 8210ms total (39.71%)\r\nDropped 486 nodes (cum \u003c= 41.05ms)\r\nShowing top 10 nodes out of 152 (cum \u003e= 80ms)\r\n      flat  flat%   sum%        cum   cum%\r\n    1990ms 24.24% 24.24%     1990ms 24.24%  0000000000402710\r\n     360ms  4.38% 28.62%      360ms  4.38%  000000000042951c\r\n     190ms  2.31% 30.94%      190ms  2.31%  000000000048196c\r\n     130ms  1.58% 32.52%      130ms  1.58%  00000000004819ae\r\n     130ms  1.58% 34.10%      130ms  1.58%  00000000004932fb\r\n     120ms  1.46% 35.57%      120ms  1.46%  0000000000481557\r\n      90ms  1.10% 36.66%       90ms  1.10%  000000000041bb08\r\n      90ms  1.10% 37.76%       90ms  1.10%  00000000004e2c50\r\n      80ms  0.97% 38.73%       80ms  0.97%  0000000000481974\r\n      80ms  0.97% 39.71%       80ms  0.97%  0000000000481983\r\n\r\n```",
