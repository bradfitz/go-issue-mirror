	"body": "This is related to #5778.\r\n\r\nI think core tool support API compatibility checking is reasonable.\r\nOne of the implementations is extending current tool \"go tool api\".\r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n```\r\n$ go tool api -version 1 local_file_or_directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nversion 0 means \"go 1.0,\" 1 means \"go 1.1\" ... and so on.\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure in detail, but I guess implementation is not so hard work.\r\n\r\nWalk third party import paths recursively, and check it compatible or not.\r\nWe already know location of api.txt.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nhiro",
