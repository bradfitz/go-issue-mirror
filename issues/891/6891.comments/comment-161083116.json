We can consider PUSH_PROMISE APIs in golang.org/x/net/http2 first, and only move things into the standard library when it's baked long enough in x/net. There were old proposals here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bradfitz/http2/pull/23\r\nhttps://github.com/bradfitz/http2/pull/34\r\n\r\nBut we no longer use that repo.
