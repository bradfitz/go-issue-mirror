If the GOBIN field is empty it should be ignored,\npreserving backward compatibility with 1.0. Although if defaultContext pulls the GOBIN\nfrom the environment, this potentially breaks backward compat, although it's arguably a\nbug fix.\n\nIn summary, I'm inclined to support adding a GOBIN field to go/build's Context, and\nremoving the GOBIN handling from cmd/go.\n\nWhat say Russ?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
