This is not\nhelpful for someone who is just getting started with the language. It is all too easy to\nmisunderstand the nature of this problem and end up calling r.Read(), which of course\nends up in an infinite loop.\n\nIt would be far more helpful to someone learning the language to have different names\nfor these two entities, preferably more than a single character long (but just making\nthem different in the first place would make the biggest difference).\u003c/pre\u003e",
