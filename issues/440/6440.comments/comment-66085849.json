It's unclear to me what you mean with \"If\nyour program fails\" as it fails always and immediately with tip.\n\nIt's supposed to print out the connection and exit as soon as a client connects, but it\ndoesn't. Nothing is printed on the screen and the connection remains open and thus it\nhas immediately failed.\n\nI can let it run until it SIGSEVs some point in the future, but again as the numbers in\n/proc/cpu/alignment are continually incrementing without the program running I'm not\nsure what info you hope to gain from that. Please clarify.\u003c/pre\u003e",
