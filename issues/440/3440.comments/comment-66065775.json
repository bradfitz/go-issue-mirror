After turning this feature off (echo 0 \u003e /proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield), go\nbuild succeeded and all tests have passed.\n\nProbably, test for exec-shield should be added to make.bash along with the test for\nSELinux allow_execstack as a long-term 'temporary' measure. \n\nI have attached a simple patch for make.bash to this report.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3440/2/exec-shield.patch\"\u003eexec-shield.patch\u003c/a\u003e (938 bytes)",
