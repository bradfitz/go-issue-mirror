What would the uintptr argument be?\r\n\r\nAre you suggesting something like\r\n\r\nfunc CreatedBy() *Func\r\n\r\nwhich would return the function that created the current goroutine?  Or something like\r\n\r\nfunc CreatedBy() (pc uintptr, file string, line int, ok bool)\r\n\r\nalong the lines of Caller?\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm wondering about is how useful it is to get the creator of the current goroutine.  I don't see any way to ask for the creator of any other goroutine.\r\n\r\nCan you describe a use for this in practice?",
