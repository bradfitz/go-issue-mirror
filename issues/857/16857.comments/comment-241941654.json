With this change I get the sequence `61 CC 88` which is according to the [UTF-8 tool](http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~richard/utf-8.cgi) the small latin letter `a` followed by a \"COMBINING DIAERESIS\" `̈ `, it should've been the single character `C3 A4`. I don't know if - according to UTF-8 rules - the single character _containing_ the diaeresis and the character followed by a combining diaeresis are equivalent, but it seems in this case the output doesn't like it as my console prints it as `a¨`",
