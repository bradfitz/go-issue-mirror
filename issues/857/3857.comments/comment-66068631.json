If you run two simultaneous queries outside a transaction they basically run in\ndifferent implicit transactions.\n\nTrue. But how is it related to our discussion?\n\n\u003e ... It is far from clear to me that you are allowed to try to do multiple\nparallel things inside a transaction rather than doing them in\nsequence. Transactions are about grouping things, not necessarily\nrunning them in parallel. ...\n\nI agree that \"ransactions are about grouping things\". I think that nothing else should\nmatter. It is up to database to decide if parallel or sequential statement execution is\nin order. It should not be enforced by our database/sql package.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
