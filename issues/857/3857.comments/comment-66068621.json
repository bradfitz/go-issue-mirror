Whole point of having database transaction is to create temporary but fixed\nenvironment where multiple database statements can be executed, illusion of \"stable\"\nworld.\n\nIf you think about changing the doco, what would your new doco say?\n\nIf you ask for my opinion, I think you are doing too much inside of database/sql. In my\nopinion, drivers is where all these decisions should be made. I suspect, most drivers\nwould handle my example with no problem, while you are proposing to \"disallow\" it.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
