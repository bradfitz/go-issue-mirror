Whole \"transaction\" idea is about executing\n\"multiple\" actions inside one single context. Are you saying these actions have to run\nserially? Why? If database supports parallel execution, why would we restrict that\ninterface.\n\nIf you decide to proceed with this idea, then our api should change to block in these\nsituations. Current api allows creation of 2 rowsets, they should both work. Why would\nyou allow one to work, but the other fail?\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
