I hope we should have many of former and just a couple of later.\n\nRegardless of how silly my example looks, the fact that it compiles and runs and then\ncrashes with \"throw: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!\" is not a good look on our\npart.\n\nI do not know enough about SQLite to answer your question, but I will investigate when I\nhave time. Either way, if SQLite does not support this, the driver can just say so by\nfailing.\n\nDriver opts-in sounds like a great plan to me.\n\nSure, I can write my own database access package, when I have unlimited time :-).\n\nYou created database/sql package while you had no \"real\" drivers for it. It is possible\nthat you have made some mistakes.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
