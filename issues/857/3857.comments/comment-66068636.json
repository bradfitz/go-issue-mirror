The thinking on this topic\nis very, very wrong from everyone but Alex.  Alex is absolutely right.  Every database\ndriver supports multiple actions being performed in a single transaction on a single\nconnection at the same time.  \n\nIf you want a real-world example:  I have a small app that is supposed to\nmigrate+massage+merge data from one table (that's loaded annually directly from a SQL\nfile) to a master table.  Within the transaction I have one query that runs against my\nsource table, cycling through each record, and other queries check to see if the record\nalready exists (the data for the source table is updated annually).  I need to run this\nall in a transaction, so that if any update fails it all fails.  Unfortunately, Go\ndeadlocks on this second query, which means this scenario/app is not feasible in Go\nunless I risk doing things outside of a transaction.\n\nFor what it's worth, as an exercise I've rewritten the app in Python, Ruby, Java, and\nJavaScript (Node).  Works in every other language/driver with nearly the exact same\nlogic.  I thought I was going crazy.  Turns out it's just Go that's crazy.\u003c/pre\u003e",
