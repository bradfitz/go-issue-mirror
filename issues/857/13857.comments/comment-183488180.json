	"body": "@rogpeppe, any thoughts on how you would like deferrals to appear in the traceback? Adding the panic calls in is straightforward, but I'm not sure what to show for deferrals (if anything). Already any call from a panic frame is a deferral. Is there more information you'd like to see? We could simply mark those as deferred calls so users don't need to know that that's what it means when panic \"calls\" a function. We could add a line that says where they were deferred from, perhaps printing the function name so it's easier to match up with the later frame?",
