	"body": "The confusing call sequence is because it's in the process of unwinding defers. It looks like TestEntityIssuesBaseEntityQuerySequentiallyForPromulgatedURL pushed (\\*Cache).Close on the defer stack, so the panic in Unlock, in a sense, *did* call (\\*Cache).Close, though I agree that the presentation of this could perhaps be less confusing. Close wound up waiting on a waitgroup that never finished (and perhaps never will?), so you got stuck in the middle of unwinding the defers. Since, in principle, it was still possible to recover this panic at this point, it couldn't print out the panic.\r\n\r\nSo, given this, I'm curious if you have thoughts on what you would like to see in the stack trace that would make this clearer.",
