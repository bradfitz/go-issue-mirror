	"body": "\u003cpre\u003ehttptest.ResponseRecorder does not mimic the behavior of the net/http package when\nheaders are written after a call to WriteHeader().\n\nPer the documentation for http.ResponseWriter:\n\n    Header returns the header map that will be sent by WriteHeader.\n    Changing the header after a call to WriteHeader (or Write) has\n    no effect.\n\nHowever, if you change the header after a call to WriteHeader while using\nhttptest.ResponseRecorder the result will appear as though the header was set (and sent)\ncorrectly. \n\nThis appears to be caused by the fact that in this function:\n\n// Header returns the response headers.\nfunc (rw *ResponseRecorder) Header() http.Header {\n        m := rw.HeaderMap\n        if m == nil {\n                m = make(http.Header)\n                rw.HeaderMap = m\n        }\n        return m\n}\n\nthere is no check to see if rw.wroteHeader is true. Anything set before or after\n`rw.wroteHeader = true` will still show up in this map.\n\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n1. In an http.HandlerFunc, call rw.Header().Set(\u0026quot;Some-Header\u0026quot;,\n\u0026quot;Some-Value\u0026quot;) after a call to rw.WriteHeader(statuscode)\n2. Call this handler by passing in an httptest.ResponseRecorder\n\nWhat happened?\n\nrecorder.HeaderMap[\u0026quot;Some-Header\u0026quot;][0] will be set to \u0026quot;Some-Value\u0026quot;\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\n\u0026quot;Some-Header\u0026quot; should not have been set\u003c/pre\u003e",
