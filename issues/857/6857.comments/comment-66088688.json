Zero-size values are not allocations - they all return the same\npointer, which is not part of the standard heap. Setting a finalizer on that would not\nbe useful, since it is never freed.\n\nWe aren't going to remove this optimization, so either we should make SetFinalizer just\nbe a no-op in this case or document that it is invalid to use SetFinalizer on blocks of\nsize zero.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **go1.3**, **documentation**, removed **go1.3maybe**._",
