	"body": "by **beoran**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThis bug report is due to the discussion at:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/34d6a5b928242d25\"\u003ehttp://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/34d6a5b928242d25\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe problem is that cgo currently generates #pragma dynimport with an absolute path.\nThis makes it difficult to distribute the binaries generated. Russ suggested in the\ndiscussion tha tany / in the path should be replaced by a _. I think that is probably\nthe simplest way to slove this problem.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nLinux 386\n\nWhich revision are you using?
