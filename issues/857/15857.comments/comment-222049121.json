Thanks for the PR!\n\nUnfortunately, the Go project doesn't use GitHub's Pull Requests,\nso we can't accept your contribution this way.\nWe instead use a code review system called Gerrit.\n\nThe good news is, I'm here to help.\n\nFrom here, you have two options:\n\n1. Read our [Contribution Guidelines](https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html) to learn how to send a change with Gerrit.\n2. Or, [create an issue](https://golang.org/issue/new) about the issue this PR addresses, so that someone else can fix it.\n\nI'm going to close this Pull Request now.\nPlease don't be offended! :-)\n\nThanks again,\n\nGopherBot (on behalf of the Go Team)\n",
