Is setting a hard deadline on the connection with [SetDeadline()](https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Conn) rather than a timeout on creating the ClientConn the only option? Setting a hard deadline on a long-lived connection SSH connection feels wrong to me, but I'm probably misunderstanding something. Would the recommended pattern be to set the deadline before establishing the ClientConn, then unset it afterwards?",
