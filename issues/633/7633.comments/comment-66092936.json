That is,\neven if we know the pointer we're following is a *T, we don't assume the\nblock it points at has type T. This is because it might actually be an\ninterior pointer into a larger block. The exceptions are things we have\ncomplete control over, typically pointers hidden from Go programs. For\nexample, if we have a string value, we know the pointer inside is actually\npointing at string data (except for the 0-length bug of course).\n\nAlso, the dangling pointers tend to be the untyped ones, from C.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
