	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eReceived via private mail.  Think about for Go 1.1.\n---\n\nI'm currently using \u0026quot;encoding/xml\u0026quot; to read some XML into some structs. All is\ngoing well until I hit an XML type that could have n number of attributes with p number\nof child nodes (and each child node can follow the same rules). I think I have the child\nnode thing solved, but what about collecting all of the attributes?\n\nThis is what I have at this point:\n\n    type Extensions struct {\n    \tXMLName xml.Name\n    \tAttrs   []string     `xml:\u0026quot;,attr\u0026quot;`     // Does not work. Need a suggestion here.\n    \tData    string       `xml:\u0026quot;,chardata\u0026quot;`\n    \tNodes   []Extensions `xml:\u0026quot;,any\u0026quot;`\n    }\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\u003c/pre\u003e",
