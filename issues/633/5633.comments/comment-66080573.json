Once people start checking out\ntags, they'll want some sort of revision locking to keep the team in sync. Once multiple\nprojects are in the works, people will want the versions for one project to differ from\nthe next. Lots of people are trying different things and building different tools, and\nthere is still a lot of room to explore.\n\nSo while I think it's great to recognize the question, I'm not sure what the answer is.\nCurious where this goes.\u003c/pre\u003e",
