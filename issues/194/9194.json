See the\n// ConnState type and associated constants for details.\nConnState func(net.Conn, ConnState)\n\nI think it would be possible to re-use the same data structure ConnState for connections\nto clients in the Transport.\n\nThe use cases include:\n\n* Limiting the connections to the clients\n* Cooperation with back-end servers in case of reverse proxy (e.g. draining off\nconnections)\u003c/pre\u003e",
