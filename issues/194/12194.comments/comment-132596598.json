	"body": "On android we redirect stdout and stderr to logd (the system logger) because there is no way to get access to an app's stdout for debugging on a non-root android phone, the usual development environment.\r\n\r\nBut that's not so on iOS, where stdout and stderr fit neatly with starting an app from inside Xcode. The attached lldb picks them up and drops them neatly in the output window, interleaved correctly with results from NSLog.\r\n\r\nSo redirecting os.Stdout and os.Stderr as we do for android would be consistent but an unpleasant development experience, so I think the inconsistency is worth it.\r\n\r\nFor the log package, there's a question: should we mirror the output to the system log? (We can do so quite easily by calling log.SetOutput(io.MultiWriter(os.Stdout, ...)).) I think we should match the behavior of NSLog here. Does it go to both?",
