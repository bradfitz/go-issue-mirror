I now better understand what\nthis code means.  However, I still find it pretty confusing.\n\nWhat this code says is, \"if you were able to assert that you can cast err to\n*os.PathError, then check out the particular error.\"  However, at a cognitive level,\nthis is a little off putting because, when I think of \"ok\", \"ok\" means that there wasn't\nan error.  In this case, \"ok\" means there was a *os.PathError.  Combine the fact that\nthere's some cognitive dissonance along with the fact that err.(*os.PathError) won't be\nimmediately recognizable for someone used to C-style casts, and you have the potential\nfor newbie confusion.\n\nI'm pretty good at learning new languages, and I was very diligent about reading the\ntutorial and reading Effective Go very carefully.  I even took a lot of notes.  If it\nconfuses me, I'm pretty sure it'll confuse others.  If I were writing the code, I would\nhave probably used \"isPathError\" instead of \"ok\".  However, I understand how much Go\nleans toward conciseness.\n\nHence, all I'm asking is for a couple more sentences explaining the code.\u003c/pre\u003e",
