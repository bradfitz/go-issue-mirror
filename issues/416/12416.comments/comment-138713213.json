For quite long, this looked to me like: \"C code may not store a (Go pointer into Go memory)\", and the only meaning I was able to interpret from this was, that it maybe accidentally lost the \"Go pointer definition\" to mean: \"C code may not store [anywhere] a Go[-originating] pointer [to] Go memory\"; in other words: \"C code may not store anywhere a *Go pointer as defined earlier*\". Only much later it occurred to me that the \"into Go memory\" part may link to \"store\", not to \"Go pointer\", but I still wasn't certain.\r\n\r\nWith this clarification, I now know how to read this, thanks. That said, it'd be nice if you could consider rephrasing as above, so that there's no place for confusion, possibly. Tx",
