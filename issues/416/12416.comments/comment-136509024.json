For each Go value you need to pass to Python, increment a counter to get a token value, and store the Go value in the map at that location.  When calling back into Go, pass the token value.  The Go side uses the token to look into the map to fetch the value.  When you release the Python value, tell the Go side to delete the map entry.  This mechanism is probably simplest if the Python code never needs to examine the Go value.",
