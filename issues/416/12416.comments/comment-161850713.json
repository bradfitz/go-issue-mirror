If you pass a uintptr, it will not be considered to be a pointer.  This does of course mean that you can avoid the runtime checks by using the unsafe package; ensuring that a program that uses unsafe is memory safe is not a goal, because there are many ways that a program that uses unsafe can fail to be memory safe.",
