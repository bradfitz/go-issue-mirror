I'm not opposed to handling them somehow in the future, though I don't know what that would look like.  In the meantime you'll have to allocate the buffers in C, or you'll have to call the C code with multiple arguments.\r\n\r\nB) It's possible, but does it really come up that often in a performance sensitive context?\r\n\r\nC) In the default mode, nothing will happen if a C function takes too long, except that your program might eventually run out of memory because the GC can't run (that won't happen with 1.6 but it might happen in future releases).  In the checking mode, you will get a panic.  If you want to call a C function that does a read on a device that blocks arbitrarily long, you should read the data into a buffer allocated by C.  We will make the syscall.Read function do the right thing on a long-blocking read, whatever that turns out to be.",
