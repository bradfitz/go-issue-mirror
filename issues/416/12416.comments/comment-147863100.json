	"body": "An update: after doing some work on adding the cgo restrictions I described, I'm no longer happy with the idea.  I feel like the basic rules about what a Go program is permitted to do are understandable.  The cgo changes, however, were enforcing a different set of rules.  If the cgo restrictions reliably forbade everything forbidden by the rules, then that might be OK, but they don't.  So it would leave us with two different kinds of restrictions that programmers would have to understand, which does not seem good.\r\n\r\nI am now leaning toward implementing a dynamic check in cgo that catches most invalid cases, and an optional dynamic check that catches all invalid cases.  I am also thinking about a go vet checker to look for cases that look fishy.",
