Would they be ok with some extra annotations specific to them?\r\n\r\nB) Could we find out or annotate C functions that do not call back into Go and thus avoid having to mark data as escaping and allocating from heap?\r\n\r\nC) what kind of errors will be returned when a C function takes too long? What is the story with regards to read(2) and blocking devices?",
