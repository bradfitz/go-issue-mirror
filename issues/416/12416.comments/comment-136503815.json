Prohibiting passing any Go pointers into C is too severe and prevents too many reasonable coding patterns.  This is the minimal next step.\r\n\r\nTo be very pedantic, the proposed solution is the set of rules listed in the issue.  The cgo work is an attempt to detect violations of those rules at build time.\r\n\r\n\u003e For completeness, I see another solution of simply ruling that C code may not access Go pointers in Go memory. I.e., if a *N pointer is passed to C code, the C code may freely read/write Buf, but not Next. Instead, the C code would need to call into a Go helper if it wants to access the pointers. (Analogously, Go code needs to call into C helpers to access unusual C struct members like bit fields.)\r\n\r\nI don't see any technical problems with this.  But it seems easier to get wrong, and doesn't seem any simpler.",
