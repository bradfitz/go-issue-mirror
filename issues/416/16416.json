	"body": "CL 25004 allows amd64 to compute a % b and a / b with a single instruction. However, rewriting code to use it currently risks a regression on architectures with a divmod instruction. We could probably do the rewrite at a generic level instead, and lower a % b to a - b * (a / b) on architectures without divmod. Then we could use the clearer, faster formulation everywhere.\r\n\r\ncc @randall77 @MichaelTJones @martisch @bradfitz ",
