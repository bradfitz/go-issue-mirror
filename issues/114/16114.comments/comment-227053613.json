Can require a significant resources to implement (which is not always justified)\r\nI think that's (possible) enough list (at least here).\r\nEg. `break some principle` can means anything:\r\n1. Make more complex\r\n2. Make slower\r\n3. Make something intrusive\r\n4 etc.\r\n\r\nI think (forgive me for it) that this proposal does not violated with the mentioned above criteria.\r\nThat is:\r\n1. Does not break some principle\r\n2. Does not break some functionality\r\n3. Does not require a significant resources to implement\r\n\r\nAbout why this need in Go I will explain in my next comment (a little bit later).\r\n",
