Classes means a `virtual` and `abstract` methods.\r\nGo does not have them.\r\nBut Go has other concepts and one of them is `concept of receivers` (you know what I mean).\r\nIf any `type` can have a `set of methods` related to it then why did not allow (not force, in any case) to declare some part of this `set of methods` all togheter in a some grouped form of shortened declaration?\r\nBenefits:\r\n1. Less code. The (`func receiver`) always omitted which means we are inside a `parenthesized method declarations` of some type\r\n2. Grouping (by some reason, in some place)\r\n3. Not need to warry about `receiver` specifying each time when you add a new method inside such `block` only because you already specify it (once) in the `header` of parenthesized method declarations.",
