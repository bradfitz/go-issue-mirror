	"body": "OpenSSH supports [a protocol extension for host key rotation](https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/tree/PROTOCOL?id=deb8d99ecba70b67f4af7880b11ca8768df9ec3a#n284). While it probably isn't widely deployed yet, the world would be better if it were. See [this blog post](http://blog.djm.net.au/2015/02/key-rotation-in-openssh-68.html) for background information.\r\n\r\n[The `AddHostKey` function](https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/59a4410d829a8bb774b02b56d4aeab633414f233/ssh/server.go#L77-L89) currently overwrites host keys of the same algorithm. I suspect this could be extended to track all keys and offer them to clients using the \"hostkeys-00@openssh.com\" message.",
