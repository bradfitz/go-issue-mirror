The relocation number 42 is not defined for x86_64, and it is implausible that it would be found in an x86_64 GNU/Linux ELF file (the 298 is just 42 + 256 and has to do with the Go linker's internal representation).  It would be normal to find it in an ARM or PPC64 ELF file.\r\n\r\nThe incorrect file is in the archive /home/jaccarmac/local/golang/pkg/linux_amd64/runtime/cgo.a.  Run `ar x /home/jaccarmac/local/golang/pkg/linux_amd64/runtime/cgo.a _all.o`.  Attach that file to the issue.",
