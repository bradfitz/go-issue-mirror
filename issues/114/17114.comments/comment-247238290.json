How many would benefit is probably somewhere between some and a few due to writing multiple sections of a file concurrently being a fairly limited use case. Symmetry with Section Reader is probably the strongest case in this situation.\r\n\r\nOff hand the obvious use cases would be writing sections of a file concurrently from a download such as byte rage file from a network, or something similar to a torrent.\r\n\r\nThe code being written already or not I'm not sure has a big impact, but understand not wanting to have outstanding issues that potentially never get fulfilled.\r\n\r\n",
