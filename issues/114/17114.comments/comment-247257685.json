They have use, but are probably not widely useful enough to be in the standard library. It wasn't particularly hard implementing `SectionWriter` myself, though.\r\n\r\nAlso, the argument for symmetry can go both ways. That is, it could be argued that we should remove `SectionReader` to keep it symmetrical. Compatibility agreement aside, I would actually vote to remove `SectionReader`.",
