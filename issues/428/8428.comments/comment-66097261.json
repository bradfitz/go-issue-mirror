Currently zeroArray() doesn't take into account that the array element type might\nalready have size 0, so \"int x[4][0];\" gets translated to \"x [0][0]int32\".  (In practice\nthis probably isn't worth worrying about, but it's also easy to fix.)\n\n3. The handling of arrays with more than two dimensions is wrong; e.g., it translates\n\"int z[1][2][3][4];\" into \"z [1][4][3][2]int32\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
