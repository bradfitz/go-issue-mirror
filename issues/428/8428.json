	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI noticed that Go 1.3 (and tip) with the following program:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/4Zr8yEmWVN\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/4Zr8yEmWVN\u003c/a\u003e\n\nProduces inconsistent type for the data field in struct. In struct result1_t the data\nfield is correctly translated into data [0]_Ctype_char. However in result2_t, probably\ndue to an additional alignment field, it is translated into data [0]byte. It is very\nfrustrating, since [0]_Ctype_char and [0]byte are not compatible (being technically\ndifferent types), so depending on alignment (e.g. pointer size of the architecture) and\nsurrounding fields structures may be translated differently. Is it possible to always\nemit correct type [0]_Ctype_char in this case, or would that break compatibility promise?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/8428/0/mypackage.go\"\u003emypackage.go\u003c/a\u003e (534 bytes)",
