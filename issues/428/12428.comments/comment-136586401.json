	"body": "It is a bad API. But it's unfortunately a common one, either explicitly (you're told that this is the case) or implicitly (some struct has a `char field[N]` field and documentation doesn't say it's always null-terminated). People creating certain sorts of C APIs love embedded fixed-size char fields instead of out of line `char *` pointers because it requires less allocation and simplifies things like moving these structs across user space/kernel boundaries. And then people writing Go packages to interface with these C APIs get to deal with the mess.\r\n",
