	"body": "With @ianlancetaylor showing the simple way to deal with this, I agree that no additional function is needed. My concern can be dealt with with a documentation note telling people to do this for copying such struct fields instead of just using C.GoString() (and not necessarily in cmd/cgo's godoc; there's the wiki and other supplementary materials on cgo).\r\n\r\n(If left alone with no guidance I think that many people will just use C.GoString(), especially if they are not experienced C programmers but are instead just using cgo to connect Go to some C library or the like. Even relatively experienced C programmers sometimes commit this mistake in C code, after all, and it slipped my mind recently when I was writing cgo code. Treating struct fields as C strings is easy and really tempting and it works almost all of the time.)",
