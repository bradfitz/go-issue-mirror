However when connected to something really slow (eg: hotel wifi)\nwhere remote requests can stall for a while, the loading of a godoc page can become\nblocked for a long time as it tries to fetch jquery from googleapis.com\n\nI think it would be better if it were reverted back to serving the local copy all the\ntime, at least that works consistently.\u003c/pre\u003e",
