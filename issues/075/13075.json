	"body": "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nI just discovered with a coworker that `strings.Split` returns a slice of length 1 even if the slice itself is empty in the case of `s` being empty. \r\n\r\nYou then can't really figure out by len(slice) if your string was properly parsed or not, sometimes even resulting in such code : `slice[len(slice) -1]` triggering a panic. \r\n\r\nI'm updating `strings.go` l282 to this : `if n == 0 || len(s) == 0 {` \r\n\r\nI wanted to get a green light before doing the commit process. \r\n\r\nCheers.",
