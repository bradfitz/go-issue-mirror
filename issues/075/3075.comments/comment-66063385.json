The original report was about the\nerror not being machine readable because of the leading \"http: \".\n\nFor me, at least, the current error gives me an accurate line number, and I can go see\nwhat's on that line and match it up with \"package could not be found locally\", so in\nthat sense it's perfectly human-readable. I can't, however, push the error through vim\nand let it take me to the right line automatically, hence it is not machine-readable.\n\nI guess both birds will be killed with the same stone, whether the stone is thrown by a\nhuman or a machine.\u003c/pre\u003e",
