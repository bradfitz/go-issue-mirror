	"body": "Equivalent struct literals may be written in several ways:\r\n   T{1, 2}\r\n   T{a: 1, b: 2}\r\n   T{b: 2, a: 1}\r\nThe 'eg' tool should allow a pattern using any of these forms to match any of these expressions.  That means internally converting to the named form and doing name-based (not index-based) matching of subtrees.  The output should be emitted in the same form as the original.",
