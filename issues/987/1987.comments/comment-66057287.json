I guess what I'm looking for is a quick way to access packages by\ntyping in their name; there may be a better solution than what I propose here.\n\nI proposed doing this via golang.org search because, on Chrome at least, I can do:\n  control-L (moves focus to Location bar)\n  gol\u0026lt;tab\u0026gt; -\u0026gt; \"Search golang.org:\" in Location bar\n  time\u0026lt;enter\u0026gt; takes me to the search result page\nIdeally, this would take me straight to the time package page, but a search result page\nwith \"package time\" near the top would also be great.\u003c/pre\u003e",
