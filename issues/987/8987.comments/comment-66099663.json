In this particular case, the compiler falsely reports the error as\nbeing with line 13, when instead it means \"somewhere in line 11-13\".\n\nIn my non-reduced error case it meant I had to go through 15 statements and try to\nfigure out which one was actually causing the exception. The fact that I first had to\nfigure out that when the error said \"nil panic on line 270\" it actually meant \"nil panic\non line 267\" did not help in debugging.\u003c/pre\u003e",
