	"body": "The spwanAndKill func is racy. The cmd.Process.Kill()\nraces with cmd.Wait. I think this is working as intended,\nthere is no way for Go to prevent this race (say, we make\nKill check if the waitpid has returned, but that is still racy,\nas waitpid could finish anytime after the check and before\nthe kill syscall). It's the programmer's responsbility to\neliminate the race.\n\nIf you want to kill the process after a timeout, just wait\nfor the timeout, kill it unconditionally, and then Wait.\n",
