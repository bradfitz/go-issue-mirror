Can it return its input unchanged if there's nothing to escape?\r\nWhy is there a whole package for this if not for allocation reductions, yet this returns copies of data? Or does it work like append? It's undocumented.\r\n\r\n\u003e EscapeAdv likes to escape very thoroguhly\r\n\r\nWhat does that mean!?\r\n\r\nIf we need to make escaping faster in the standard library, we'll fix the standard library when the problem has been identified.\r\n\r\nBut switching to an ill-specified external library is not the answer at the moment.\r\n",
