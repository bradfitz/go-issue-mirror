	"body": "Just to expand on the original report a bit, when the heap is full of dead spans like in this test case, half of the time in sweepone is spent just incrementing the sweepidx and the other half is spent in cache misses just to check the span state (and determine that it's dead). This particular test amplifies this because it drives so many GC cycles in the second phase and, since the number of spans never goes down from the peak, between the closely spaced GC cycles in the second phase, sweeping has to sweep all of the dead spans.\r\n\r\nThis isn't going to happen for 1.7, but my hope for 1.8 is that we can eliminate proportional sweeping entirely, which will fix this problem at its root.",
