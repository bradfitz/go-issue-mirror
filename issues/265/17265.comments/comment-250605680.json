(callback function, event channel?)\r\n\r\nOr should this just expose the value of maxConcurrentStreams through `http2.ClientConn` -- with the client polling the value?\r\n\r\nI'm also curious what the direction is for #13774 (blocking the transport)? By itself, that may prevent the REFUSED_STREAM errors I'm seeing. Though my code would be left guessing at the optimal number of concurrent requests without visibility into maxConcurrentStreams.",
