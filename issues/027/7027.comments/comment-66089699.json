That was also my assumption.\n\nI share you concerns, and I think others might also against doing\nany more work on the C compiler.\n\nHowever, if it's pretty easy to fix, then I think we can give it a try.\nI also have plan to make use of the Plan 9 C compiler in the Go\ntoolchain to do something else (build sqlite, to be specific so that\nwe can have a non-cgo version of sqlite)\nPerhaps I should just defer that project until Russ has done his\nC-\u003eGo translator, and hack on that instead.\u003c/pre\u003e",
