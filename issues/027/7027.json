	"body": "by **czapkofan**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eSorry, I didn't check in newest version, but investigating this in a thirdparty codebase\n(which I'm trying to port to cc) already took really much effort on my side, and I'm\ntired, and I believe the example is minimal enough for you to quickly verify.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. mkdir example; cd example\n2. # create \u0026quot;example.c\u0026quot; containing:\n#include \u0026quot;runtime.h\u0026quot;\n\nvoid\n·runtest() {\n\tint32 i = -1;\n\tuint8 c = 255;\n\tif (i\u0026lt;c)\n\t\truntime·prints(\u0026quot;true\\n\u0026quot;);\n\telse\n\t\truntime·prints(\u0026quot;false\\n\u0026quot;);\n}\n3. # create \u0026quot;example.go\u0026quot; containing:\npackage main\n\nfunc runtest()\n\nfunc main() {\n\truntest()\n}\nEOF\n4. go build .\n5. ./example  # windows: example.exe\n\nWhat is the expected output?\ntrue\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nfalse\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6c, I presume\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows, amd64 (but I believe 386 is affected too)\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.2rc2 windows/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nAlso, I don't know the C standard so well to really be sure about it, but from\n\u003ca href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/17312930/98528\"\u003ehttp://stackoverflow.com/a/17312930/98528\u003c/a\u003e I believe this should be reported as\n\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; (and that is also what apparently gcc prints for a similar program).\nI've encountered this when trying to port Lua codebase (which is quite a robust ANSI C\ntested on fairly many compilers and architectures) to Go toolchain's cc. As a side note,\nI'm also somewhat surprised there's no warning from the compiler on the comparison,\nwhile it seems to be quite eager in warning about various similar suspicious activities.\u003c/pre\u003e",
