If we were running on m_gsignal, then we should have been running in a signal handler already when we hit INT 3 and triggered the SIGTRAP.\r\n\r\nHowever, we mask all signals while handling signals.  Also, at least on Linux, if you use INT 3 and have masked SIGTRAP, then the process core dumps immediately.  Looking at NetBSD's trapsignal() kernel function, I think they do the same.\r\n\r\nSo the confusing part is, how did we print that SIGTRAP backtrace?",
