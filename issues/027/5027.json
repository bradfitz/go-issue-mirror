	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eNaming the temp work directories using import paths means that if you're building\nx/y/z/w you end up working in /tmp/garbage/x/y/z/w and then you need to put compiled\npackages somewhere during a test so you end up with\n/tmp/garbage/x/y/z/w/_test/x/y/z/w.a. If the path is long, the doubling here can exceed\nOS limits, especially on Windows where the limit is 250 bytes. \n\nWe can shuffle things a little in the go command so that the import path need never\nappear twice in the temporary path. That will buy us a little space.\n\nA better fix is to use the \\\\?\\ syntax on Windows to get longer path names, but that fix\nis fraught with peril and too dangerous for Go 1.1.
