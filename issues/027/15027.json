What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\ndarwin amd64 [os x]\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nI tried to use Proxy with a `Bearer` authentication method.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nAllow other authentication method than Basic HTTP\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nProxy authentication is limited to Basic-HTTP-Authentication only, with user \u0026 password:\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/http/transport.go#L493\r\n\r\n6. Suggestion\r\n - `url.URL` should allow custom authentication such as `bearer`\r\n - `url.URL` should provide a method that returns the \"authentication header value\", and do the base64 etc.",
