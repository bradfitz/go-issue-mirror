	"body": "mouse.Event currently looks like this:\r\n```go\r\ntype Event struct {\r\n    // X and Y are the mouse location, in pixels.\r\n    X, Y float32\r\n\r\n    // Button is the mouse button being pressed or released. Its value may be\r\n    // zero, for a mouse move or drag without any button change.\r\n    Button Button\r\n\r\n    // Modifiers is a bitmask representing a set of modifier keys:\r\n    // key.ModShift, key.ModAlt, etc.\r\n    Modifiers key.Modifiers\r\n\r\n    // Direction is the direction of the mouse event: DirPress, DirRelease,\r\n    // or DirNone (for mouse moves or drags).\r\n    Direction Direction\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of using float32 for X and Y? Is it ever the case that sub-pixel information is needed for mouse events?\r\n\r\nI propose that we instead embed image.Point, as in https://godoc.org/9fans.net/go/draw#Mouse, to ease the following kind of code:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// ev is a mouse.Event\r\nif ev.Point.In(myWidget.Bounds()) {\r\n    ev.Point = ev.Point.Sub(myWidget.Bounds().Min)\r\n    myWidget.SendMouseEvent(ev)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any comment on the reasoning behind the current approach, and whether my proposed approach could work. Thanks!",
