However, we also provide additional packages\nthat you can install to build for the non-native architecture.\n\nE.g. on linux/amd64, youâ€™ll get a cgo-enabled compiler built for linux/amd64. You can\noptionally install golang-go-windows-386 which contains a cross-compiled windows/386\nstdlib, so you can easily cross-compile if you desire to do so.\u003c/pre\u003e",
