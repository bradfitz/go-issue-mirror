But I assume you copied the wrong one off your system and that on your system you are still using a 64-bit DLL, just not that one. When I tried to run with the 32-bit DLL I got exit code 0xc000007b. (Missing DLL is 0xc0000135.)\r\n\r\nMy guess is that something is wrong with your Windows 7 system, possibly with the version of oci.dll that you have installed. The one that worked for me was the \"Instant Client Package - Basic\", from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/winx64soft-089540.html. Please try extracting that and put the instantclient_12_1 directory first in your %PATH%. Thanks.\r\n",
