	"body": "@ricsmania Thanks for that very small program. It is possible that what has changed is whether the cgo call executes in the main (program startup) thread. Perhaps the OCI DLL requires that the call be started from the main thread. If you put\r\n\r\nfunc init() {\r\n   runtime.LockOSThread()\r\n}\r\n\r\nin your program, then func main will be forced to run in the main OS thread. It would be interesting to see if that changes the behavior reliably.\r\n",
