I recently installed Windows 10 from scratch and the problem is happening on Go 1.5 with 3 different drivers:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mattn/go-oci8\r\nhttps://github.com/go-goracle/goracle\r\nhttps://github.com/rana/ora\r\n\r\nIf I use \"-linkmode internal\" or create the environment variable GO_EXTLINK_ENABLED=0 the problem goes away, so I'm pretty sure it has to do with the linking mode.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I can't reliably reproduce it, it happens on some machines but not on others. I got to reproduce it on a VM, however I don't think I can legally distribute a Windows VM. If I reproduce it on an EC2 or Azure instance, would you be able to help us investigate it?",
