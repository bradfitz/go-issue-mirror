Tell me more.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked at the code, so it might genuinely not make sense. :) If there was a race in the build system, causing it to write twice to the same binary at the same time or read from the binary while it's being written, we could nondeterministically observe a corrupted binary. It's just a wild guess. (I know Windows has much stricter file locking semantics then POSIX, so maybe this just can't happen.)",
