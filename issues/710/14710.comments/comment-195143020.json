The only thing I can think of is that somehow cs.sect is not set properly here https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/link/internal/ld/pe.go#L954-L970 But I don't see how. It would be easy to fix once we can reproduce it somehow. Even having copy of failed executable will help, because we will know what the table looks like. I also don't have any good suggestions for adding debug code somewhere.\r\n\r\nI will think some more.\r\n\r\nAlex",
