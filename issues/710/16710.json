What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nlinux/amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nA program and import similar to these.\r\nImport: https://play.golang.org/p/n_t6GPt_9r\r\nProgram/main: https://play.golang.org/p/t9IloQX9Wj\r\nAnd using -ldflags \"-X my/pkg.git.Version=1.0\"\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n1.0\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nnotset\r\n\r\nIt seems that any import path ending with a dot before the variable name cannot be found by the linker and set using -X. .git in the import path is valid and is the only way to force 'go get' to use git+ssh afaik. I also tried my/pkg.Version and pkg.Version to the -X argument, but the only thing that fixes it is not having .git in the path (renaming the folder to not contain .git, but then this breaks go get). Is this a bug, or is there a workaround for this? I tried looking for similar issues before filing, thanks.\r\n\r\n",
