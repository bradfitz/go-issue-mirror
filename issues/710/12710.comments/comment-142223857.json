I assume some Unix variant?\r\n\r\nIt's quite likely that this behavior is platform-specific.\r\n\r\nLinux man pages say:\r\n\r\n```\r\nO_APPEND\r\nThe file is opened in append mode. Before each write(2), the file offset is positioned at the end of the file, as if with lseek(2). O_APPEND may lead to corrupted files on NFS file systems if more than one process appends data to a file at once. This is because NFS does not support appending to a file, so the client kernel has to simulate it, which can't be done without a race condition.\r\n```\r\n\r\nGo's docs merely say:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        O_APPEND int = syscall.O_APPEND // append data to the file when writing.\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps we're missing some words somewhere. We should also verify that Unix, Windows, and Plan 9 are consistent.\r\n",
