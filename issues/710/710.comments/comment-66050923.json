Neither does Google Code have a preview button. :(\n\nP.S. I was surprised to notice that runtime.Caller() has no tests. My philosophy is \nthat of the XP and TDD community: if there is no test for a feature, then that feature \ndoes not exist. This bug would have been noticed if every function would have automated \ntests.\u003c/pre\u003e",
