	"body": "by **john.arbash.meinel**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Rename 'goinstall.exe' to 'goblahblah.exe' to get around Vista requiring everything\nwith \u0026quot;install\u0026quot; in its name to be run as Administrator. (preventing me from\nrunning it on the command line, even though go itself installed fine as local user)\n2. Try to 'goblahblah launchpad.net/gocheck'\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nSuccessful installation of 'gocheck' into $GOPATH\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n$ C:/Go/bin/goblahblah launchpad.net/gorun\nC:\\Go\\bin\\goblahblah.exe: launchpad.net/gorun: command \u0026quot;bzr\u0026quot; not found in $PATH\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nPretty sure it is 8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows Vista (Home, I believe)\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\ngowin32_release.r57.1_installer.exe\nThough it doesn't have a lot to do with the specific version. I do have a local checkout\nif necessary.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nthe command 'bzr' won't be found on the path because it is 'bzr.exe'. If this was\npython, I would see a similar failure if I did:\nsubprocess.Popen('bzr args') rather than subprocess.Popen('bzr args', shell=True).\n\nI don't know if there is something like 'shell=True' for go and how go is trying to\ninvoke bzr. It basically means running \u0026quot;cmd /c bzr args\u0026quot; I think, but I\nhaven't really poked into the details.\n\nI know there can sometimes be problems with the shell=True indirection. Usually only if\nyou are trying to do something clever with the childs PID. (because the real PID is now\nthe child of cmd rather than your direct child.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
