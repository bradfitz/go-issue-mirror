What did you do?\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/aPx9TXrNaQ\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n[]interface {}, interface {} = test\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n[]interface {}, []interface {} = [test]\r\n\r\nas you can see it's a bit tricky to hit as - what i can see - there's a need to totally loose the original type information via a struct.\r\n\r\nthe compiler however is correct in this case, as if you uncomment lines 27 - 29 you get a compile time error:\r\n\r\nprog.go:27: cannot range over ss (type interface {})\r\n",
