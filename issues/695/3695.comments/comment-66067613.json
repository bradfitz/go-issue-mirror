I just ran the code linked to in the original report on\n\"go version devel +026b89723112\" as well as 1.0.3 on linux(aws ec2 instance) with the\nsame result as the original report. Compiler is 6g. When hanging with 100% cpu usage it\nalso blocks any other goroutines. \n\nIt works on OS X 10.8.2 with the same version as on linux and produces the expected\noutput.\u003c/pre\u003e",
