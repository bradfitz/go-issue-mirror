But since it only populates one source file,\nthere's no way to use play.golang.org to discuss issues around visibility (exported vs.\nunexported symbols), which is an important element of API design.  It would be great if\nplay.golang.org could support multiple text windows for different files that are then\ncompiled and linked into a single binary.\u003c/pre\u003e",
