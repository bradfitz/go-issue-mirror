The make.bat is\ncalled by all.bat and race.bat and they both expect it to return. Adding \"exit\n%GOBUILDFAIL%\" will make make.bat to exit process without returning back to the callers.\nAnd only on gobuiler. Right now both all.bat and race.bat exit anyway on make.bat\nfailure, but what happens if that changes? We'll be chasing our tails.\n\nI propose we go with Dmitriy suggestion from #3. Just different name (build.bat) for new\nmake1.bat file. See \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/99430044/\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/99430044/\u003c/a\u003e for details.\n\nI'm happy to leave it till after 1.3.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
