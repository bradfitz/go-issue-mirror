As stated above, the guarantee is about values that are actually sent on the\nchannel. In your program, it ends up being the case that values are sent in numerical\norder but no send is guaranteed to happen before any other send as specified by the\nmemory model. \n\nIn all (correct) examples, channels act as a FIFO queue (that's what the spec demands).\nHowever, the order of sends on a channel shared by multiple goroutines can only be\nguaranteed if there is a happens before relationship between the sends. Please see my\ngo-nuts post for examples.\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/PWt4r9b40bc/gOZZAugsRFgJ\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/PWt4r9b40bc/gOZZAugsRFgJ\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
