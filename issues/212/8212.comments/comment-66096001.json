Are you telling me the results in my example are ordered because it was\nintended that way? The specs are unclear. \n\nThis isn't about the code, but about the documentation. So \"Status: WorkingAsIntended\"\nisn't appropiate, unless the documentation is intended to be unclear. I seriously doubt\nthat.\n\nSo, please re-open this issue until this is resolved.\n\n#3: You wrote:\n\n    \"In all (correct) examples, channels act as a FIFO queue\"\n\nAnd what are correct examples? Please give an example that isn't correct, and that\ndoesn't act as a FIFO.\u003c/pre\u003e",
