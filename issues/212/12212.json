	"body": "@crawshaw\r\nThat's not a big issue, but it is somewhat dirty and inconsistent. There are warnings (or errors?) particularly when getting these packages (perhaps there are more):\r\n`golang.org/x/exp/shiny/driver/gldriver\r\ngolang.org/x/mobile/...`\r\n\r\nPlease don't say that this is rare case and close the issue, because it is common form. When taking an import path with `...`, go get will traverse all subpackages, so directories and files that doesn't contain go code should be named with starting underscore to avoid unnecessary warnings.\r\nExample warnings:\r\n`..\\src\\golang.org\\x\\mobile\\bind\\java\\testpkg\\testpkg.go:19:2: no buildable Go source files in C:\\Users\\Vanya\\Documents\\PROG\\Go\\src\\golang.org\\x\\mobile\\asset\r\n..\\src\\golang.org\\x\\mobile\\exp\\gl\\glutil\\glutil.go:12:2: C source files not allowed when not using cgo or SWIG: work.c\r\ncan't load package: ..\\src\\golang.org\\x\\mobile\\exp\\gl\\glutil\\glutil.go:12:2: C source files not allowed when not using cgo or SWIG: work.c`\r\n\r\nSolution is for package maintainers to find all such cases and rename the folders and files.",
