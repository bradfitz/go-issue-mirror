But as far as I understand uintptr parameters do not\nkeep objects alive anymore.\nFrequently you keep another pointer to the object, e.g. for getsockopt you want to read\nthe returned value. Mmap does not qualify here because it does not operate on Go heap\nmemory. And in the end if GC is not triggered in the small windows, then you are lucky\nas well.
