Under some versions of UNIX, there is an option available to\ndisable this behavior (IP_MULTICAST_LOOP). This option is not supported in Windows NT.\nIf you try to disable this behavior, the call fails with the error WSAENOPROTOOPT (Bad\nprotocol option). \n\"\n\nThe last phrase makes me believe that the error must happen because I've somehow\ndisabled multicast in my OS (I can't remember if I did or how, but it's quite likely\nthat I did it some time ago)\n\nIf this is so, I wonder if there's something that can be done so the test doesn't fail\nor something(maybe say that it could be because multicast is disabled in OS)... which\nprevents go getting installed at the end of tests (surely I am using make.bat which\nskips tests, to have go install, as a workaround so far)\n\nI just looked and can confirm that IGMPLevel is set to 0 for me, that means No multicast\nsupport.\n\u003ca href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc957547.aspx\"\u003ehttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc957547.aspx\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI'll do a reboot and see if it works with IGMPLevel 2\u003c/pre\u003e",
