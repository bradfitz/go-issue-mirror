	"body": "Something like:\r\n```golang\r\nrr, _ := vcs.RepoRootForImportPath(\"github.com/golang/go\", false)\r\nfmt.Println(\"Current working change id:\", rr.Cmd.GetId())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `GetId()` function prototype could be `func (v *Cmd) GetId() (string, error)` and getting an id means:\r\n\r\n1. `git` - `git rev-parse HEAD`\r\n2. `hg` - `hg id -i`\r\n3. `bzr` - `bzr revno`\r\n4. `svn` - `svnversion`\r\n\r\nThe subversion here is an odd man out, which might be troublesome as the code in `vcs` package assumes that a command stored in `Cmd` member can provide all info.\r\n\r\nMy use case is creating container images from given project, so the created image could have a vcs info in its (JSON) metadata, for example `git: 66199afb25487fd75bf870c72bc3cea33d95f89e`",
