And it is not PostgreSQL specific, but\nSQL standard.\nIt does not use an array, but the VALUES statement:\nhttp://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/sql-values.html\n\nIn Go, it can be defined, e.g.:\n\ntype Tuple []interface{} // Since Row and Value are already defined\n\ntype Values []Tuple\n\nThis have the advantage that a Values value can be specified as a parameter\nto Query or Exec function without changing the sql package API.\n",
