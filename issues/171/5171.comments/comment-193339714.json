Have a look at the implementation at https://github.com/lib/pq/blob/master/copy.go\r\n\r\nI agree it would be nice to have generic batch API but it is quite difficult to design a single API that will allow drivers to choose the optimal method to implement batched operations. I think using driver library directly is a quite good compromise.\r\n\r\nBTW, in postgresql it is also possible to use the following SQL for bulk insert:\r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO mytable (col1, col2, col3) VALUES (unnest(?), unnest(?), unnest(?))\r\n````\r\nI haven't use it though and I don't know if Go driver supports arrays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
