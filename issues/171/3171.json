I do:\n\ngo install cmd/foo/bar\n\nI get a linker error:\n\ntoo many -L's: 15\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nfrom go install -x I can see that the go tool is passing -L $GOPATH/pkg/linux_amd64 to\n6l many times.\n\nDoesn't happen with all commands, so I'm not sure what triggers it.\n\nThis tree built fine before the previous go tool fixes.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nlinux\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\ntip\u003c/pre\u003e",
