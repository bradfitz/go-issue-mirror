	"body": "The only beneficial effect I see in your change is that putting the wrapper struct in a map ensures that it will not be garbage collected while executing C code.  I think if you do the same thing with the channel then your code will work without the wrapper struct.\r\n\r\nHowever, none of this code will work if the proposal I've described in https://golang.org/issue/12416 is adopted.  That proposal will outlaw passing channel pointers to C at all.\r\n\r\nSince you have your code working I'm going to close this issue.  Feel free to reopen if I misunderstand.",
