In fact other users reported similar problems 1 year ago: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-2537. So I assumed that apache only provides http:// scheme.\r\n\r\nStill I believe to make git.apache.org repos work with Go 1.5 without the need to specify --insecure there are two things required:\r\n- git.apache.org provides HTTPS\r\n- my patch applied\r\n\r\nIf/when apache adds HTTPS support I will test my change request again. But if there will be no plans to add HTTPS support, then I guess this ticket can be closed. Lets wait some time and see what happens.\r\n",
