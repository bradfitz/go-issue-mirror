	"body": "Ok, to actually test this, I would need to write some mocking around the execs and fake their results.\r\nThe returned `repoRoot` structure in the current test setup stays the same :-/\r\nSo the current tests work the same before and afterwards.\r\n\r\nActually the difference between the createCmd and pingCmd is pretty obvious and lead to same or better results.\r\n\r\nThe amount of code added would be a few lines and will check command construction (unit testing), not command execution (integration testing). \r\nIt might look like this: https://github.com/Jimdo/periodicnoise/blob/master/cmd/pn/monitor.go#L102-L146\r\n\r\nBut I am not really comfortable adding so much (test) code that late in the release cycle and I am also unsure with what repositories the generic repository stuff handling has been tested. It would be the most affected.\r\n\r\nAdded https://golang.org/cl/10171 for it.\r\n\r\n@bradfitz Please advise how to move forward here.",
