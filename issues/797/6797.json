I want to make a function that takes a character and determines if it is\na letter or not. My initial plan was to make two functions with the same name but took\ndifferent typed arguments. One would be accept a rune for unicode and the other would\naccept a byte for ascii. To my disappointment I find out that Go does not do\noverloading. That is, in my opinion counter productive. Now I have to make one function\nand require the client to know that he/she must CAST the character to a rune/byte\ndepending on the circumstance or I have to make two functions with two different names.\nAs Jeremy Clarkson would say \u0026quot;It's shtyupid! Shtyupid!\u0026quot;. Golang team just put\noverloading into Go please. I beg you.\u003c/pre\u003e",
