Maybe change it to:\r\n```\r\nconst CREATE_NO_WINDOW = 0x08000000\r\nvar attr os.ProcAttr\r\nattr.Sys = \u0026syscall.SysProcAttr{}\r\nattr.Sys.CreationFlags = CREATE_NO_WINDOW\r\nattr.Sys.HideWindow = true\r\nos.StartProcess(\"foo\", []string{}, \u0026attr)\r\n```\r\nso you understand what it does next time you have to look at it. There are many consts defined in Windows .h files. We cannot have them all include in Go standard packages. Why should we include CREATE_NO_WINDOW and not others?\r\n\r\nAlex",
