I've reported it as a\nseparate issue: \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/1100\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/1100\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI still think that the best solution would be to refactor the code to remove the code\nduplication between extern.go and symtab.c. That would eliminate one \"bug breeding\nground\" as mentioned in \u003ca href=\"http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/no_bugs.html\"\u003ehttp://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/no_bugs.html\u003c/a\u003e Now that same\ncopy-pasted function has resulted already in two bugs.\u003c/pre\u003e",
