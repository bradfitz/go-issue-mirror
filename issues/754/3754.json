	"body": "\u003cpre\u003emultibyte characters in Windows path is not encoded in utf8, but all our command\nline programs implicitly assume utf8 encoding of path by using lib9/fmt\n(even smprint(\u0026quot;%s\u0026quot;, path) can't correctly handle multibyte paths).\n\nthe worst case is: if your user name contains multibyte characters, then you won't be\nable to use cmd/go at all, because your os.TempDir() contains multibyte characters;\nand you don't have any easy workarounds (os.TempDir() uses syscall.GetTempPath,\nand you can't override result of GetTempPath easily). Could we make os.TempDir()\nlook for %TEMP% or %TMP% first before calling GetTempPath() so that the user at least\ncould change the temporary directory to workaround the aforementioned problem?\u003c/pre\u003e",
