A large\nlimit may be a problem on small devices. A small limit may cause legitimate problems\nwith some specialized codes.\n\nI don't think we should enshrine any specific limit; I would be happy if the compiler\nwould not crash and instead report an \"out of memory\" error.\n\n(We have the same problem with large numeric constants, even though we have a limit).\u003c/pre\u003e",
