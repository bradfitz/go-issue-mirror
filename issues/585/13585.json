	"body": "CL https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/15689/ made a trivial change to fmt.Scanf to make %X an alias for %x when applied to []byte and string values.\n%x has always (even before Go 1) accepted either upper or lower case; now %X does too.\n\nThe only real effect here is that now people can write code using %X, which will only work with Go 1.6 or later, when they could instead use %x and work with Go 1 or later.\n\nShould we keep the new %X support?\nLeaving for @robpike to decide.\n\nThe original issue was #12940.",
