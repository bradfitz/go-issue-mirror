	"body": "Currently the output of vet -shadow gives something like the following:\r\n```\r\nshadowtest.go:17: declaration of local shadows declaration at shadowtest.go:16: \r\nshadowtest.go:24: declaration of global shadows declaration at shadowtest.go:8: \r\n```\r\nNotice the colon space at the end of the line and the fact, that it doesn't get directly clear, which variable is meant.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose a format as follows:\r\n```\r\nshadowtest.go:17: declaration of 'local' shadows declaration at shadowtest.go:16\r\nshadowtest.go:24: declaration of 'global' shadows declaration at shadowtest.go:8\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt least the colon space at the end shouldn't be protected by any format guarantee, since I guess it is a bug and isn't especially tested at the moment.\r\nI think the highlighting of the variable name should also be done as long as the -shadow option is still experimental.\r\n\r\nI have a CL ready.\r\n",
