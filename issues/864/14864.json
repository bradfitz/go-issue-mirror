	"body": "Running `goimports` with the `-srcdir` flag on a file with invalid Go syntax will produce syntax errors with paths in the directory provided by `-srcdir`, not the actual file. This is arguably confusing, because now the error might refer to a file that doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo \"package\" \u003e /tmp/foo.go                 \r\n$ goimports -srcdir /somewhere/else /tmp/foo.go\r\n/somewhere/else/foo.go:1:9: expected 'IDENT', found 'EOF'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect `/tmp/foo.go:1:9` in the error output.\r\n\r\n/cc @bradfitz ",
