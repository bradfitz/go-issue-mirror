How do you run or build the\nprogram?\n\nI ran this on Linux/amd64 at tip, at 3338bbc9c09b, and at go1.1.2.\n\nIn go1.1.2 it does in fact grow without bound. At tip and at 3338bbc9c09b it does not;\nit tops out around 100 MB. I believe that somehow your test of re-running the program\nwas still running an old copy, either because you are using a different 'go' command\nthan you think, or because the program was not rebuilt after the update.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: removed **go1.2maybe**._",
