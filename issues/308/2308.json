	"body": "by **ThePiachu**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI was building and testing my own version of elliptic.go library. While testing with an\noffset of TestBaseMult I had a small error displayed by line 311:\n\nt.Errorf(\u0026quot;%d: bad output for k=%s: got (%x, %s), want (%s, %s)\u0026quot;, i, e.k, x, y,\ne.x, e.y)\n\nOutput was a bit strange, some part had hex values, but one part had decimal value. As\nit turns out, there is a typo in the error message. Currently there is a mapping of:\n\n%d - i\n%s - e.k\n%x - x\n%s - y\n%s - e.x\n%s - e.y\n\nvalue y should be displayed as %x to be consistent with others. So the proper line would\nlook:\n\nt.Errorf(\u0026quot;%d: bad output for k=%s: got (%x, %x), want (%s, %s)\u0026quot;, i, e.k, x, y,\ne.x, e.y)\n\nNot the most major \u0026quot;bug\u0026quot;, probably nobody will ever come across it again, but\nfigured I might as well post it since I came across it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
