Follow the steps at the top of $GOROOT/misc/vim/readme.txt to enable all plugins\n2. vim foo.go\n3. :echo \u0026amp;filetype\n\nWhat is the expected output?\ngo\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nnothing\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nFedora Core 16\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n927ed13f91eb tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThe instructions in readme.txt are as follows:\nTo use all the Vim plugins, add these lines to your vimrc.\n\n  set rtp+=$GOROOT/misc/vim\n  filetype plugin indent on\n  syntax on\n\n\nThe issue seems to me to be that Fedora already includes a file /etc/vimrc that executes\n\u0026quot;filetype plugin on\u0026quot; before ~/.vimrc is ever executed, thus before\n$GOROOT/misc/vim is ever added to the runtime path (rtp). Since filetype the\n\u0026quot;filetype plugin indent on\u0026quot; line in ~/.vimrc does not trigger the loading of\nall the files in the ftdetect folder under all folders in the runtime path, as the\ninstructions in the readme require. Thus the instructions need to be improved.\n\nAdding \u0026quot;filetype off\u0026quot; before \u0026quot;filetype plugin indent on\u0026quot; in ~/.vimrc\nresolves the issue, as does simply copying over the gofiletype.vim file to\n~/.vim/ftdetect, but both of these solutions seem ugly to me. I don't know enough about\nvim to come up with a better solution.\u003c/pre\u003e",
