	"body": "For ByteReader, is it possible that a byte is available **and** an error is also set? I would assume this should not happen, otherwise the user would never be able to tell that a byte was returned in the event of an error.\r\n\r\nAlso, for ByteWriter, the documentation doesn't really say anything at all about it. I would assume that an error is set **if and only if** the byte was not written.\r\n\r\nCan documentation be made more clear on the error conditions?",
