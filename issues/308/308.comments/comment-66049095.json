Now that glitch is fixed it works, but there is still one thing \nthat seems wrong (which is what it was actually doing before due to my bug): `/$` \nmatches \"/abc\".\n\nfmt.Println(regexp.MustCompile(`/$`).MatchStrings(\"/abc\")); // outputs [c]\nfmt.Println(regexp.MustCompile(`/$`).MatchStrings(\"abc\")); // outputs []\n\nApologies for the incorrect original report, but this part seems to be the actual \nbug.\u003c/pre\u003e",
