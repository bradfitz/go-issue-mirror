If you have\ndownloaded binary go distro for windows-amd64, then you would not have these - you would\nhave all 64-bit tools (6g, 6l, ...) instead.\n\nYou could download windows-386 binary distro instead. It should still work on your\nWindows 7 64 bit computer, but it will build 32-bit programs only.\n\nAlternatively, you could download source files and mingw and build everything (8g, 8l,\n6g, 6l, ... and all standard packages) yourself. Here are\n\u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/WindowsCrossCompiling\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/WindowsCrossCompiling\u003c/a\u003e some instructions of mine\nfor building windows programs on linux. I think, you could do something similar on\nwindows.\n\nPlease, be warned that you can't use cgo when cross-compiling. In case of linux, it\nmeans, you won't be able to build even standard net package.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @alexbrainman._\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
