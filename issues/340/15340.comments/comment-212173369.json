	"body": "The race detector doesn't work at the assembly instruction level.  It changes the way that the code is compiled.  It does in fact point you at the exact instruction.  In the line `/xxx/kmgClose/closer.go:53 +0x3d` it's the instruction 0x3d into the function at line 53 of closer.go.  You can disassemble the program using `go tool objdump` to spot the exact instruction.  Make sure you disassemble the version of the function built with `-race`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly you can look at the stack trace of a panic to identify the exact instruction that does a nil dereference.",
