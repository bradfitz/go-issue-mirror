	"body": "Thanks.  I'm working pretty much in the dark, but my current suspicion is that something changed in the function `__commpage_gettimeofday`.  Go essentially has a copy of that function in `nanotime` in runtime/sys_darwin_amd64.s, and if the Darwin kernel changed the common page then the Go function might be doing the wrong thing.  Do you have source code for the libc?  Can you find that function in there?  Otherwise, perhaps you could build a C program that calls `gettimeofday` and use the debugger to disassemble it.",
