	"body": "In Go 1.4 and before, `go build` would say `$GOOS/$GOARCH must be bootstrapped using make.bash` because it would detect missing zasm files.\r\n\r\nIn tip, we have zgoos files, which are created by `go generate`, so they always exist for all GOOS/GOARCH combinations. `cmd/dist`, however, is still responsible for copying `textflag.h` into the per-GOOS/GOARCH `pkg/` directories. Building Go for a single platform and trying to `go build` for a different platform now won't result in a helpful error, but instead the assembler won't be able to find `textflag.h`:\r\n\r\n**Expected output:**\r\n```\r\ndominikh-pc /tmp $ GOOS=darwin go build\r\ngo build runtime: darwin/amd64 must be bootstrapped using make.bash\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual output:**\r\n```\r\ndominikh-pc /tmp $ GOOS=darwin go build\r\n# runtime\r\n/home/dominikh/go/src/runtime/asm.s:6 6a: No such file or directory: textflag.h\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Version:**\r\n```\r\ngo version devel +3fa5d3a Thu Dec 11 15:23:18 2014 +0000 linux/amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis only affects tip, not Go 1.4.",
