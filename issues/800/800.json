I \nuse 8g version 5440.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThe compiler to generate code that either first evaluates all expressions in the chained \narguments, or code that evaluates the chain from left-to-right. Either way, not to do it \ndifferently. \n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\ndarwin; 386\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n17ded5ad443b tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nRelevant assembly is also attached. Line 27 clearly starts with invoking s.Len(), while\nline 33 \nbegins with s.Clear().\n\nBtw, I might imagine that this is just 'the way things work' with the len(...)\nexpression probably \njust being a pointer to the slice's length field or something, but still, from an\nimplementing view it \ntook me half the night to figure out what the hell was going on.\u003c/pre\u003e",
