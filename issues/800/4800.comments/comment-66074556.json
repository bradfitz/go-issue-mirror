From the curl manual:\n\n\"When authentication is used, curl only sends its credentials to the initial host. If a\nredirect takes curl to a different host, it won't be able to intercept the\nuser+password. See also --location-trusted on how to change this.\"\n\n\n --location-trusted\n              (HTTP/HTTPS) Like -L, --location, but will allow sending the name + password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you to a site to which you'll send your authentication info (which  is  plain-\n              text in the case of HTTP Basic authentication).\n\n\nI think this is a pretty sensible behavior and I already have a patch which implements\nthis is the net/http package. By default, all headers but WWW-Authenticate are copied\nand the User property in the initial URL is not copied. If the property TrustRedirects\nin the request it set, it will copy everything, including the User property of the\ninitial URL. So, should I just submit this patch as a CL or do you have any objections?\u003c/pre\u003e",
