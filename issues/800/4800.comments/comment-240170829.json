	"body": "Also just been bitten by this, calling an API with an Authorization header, and the API does a redirect. I can't avoid the redirect, the API implements a /whoami` endpoint that looks at the identity of the owner of the Authorization token and then redirects to the given `/profile/%d` that is the person. The issue is that without the Authorization header being present on that subsequent call I get back a guest view of the profile in question, rather than the profile owners view of that profile.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of implementing a solution similar to cURL wherein headers are retained for redirects on the same host (and scheme would be wise too) is a good one.\r\n\r\nThis is go1.7 btw.",
