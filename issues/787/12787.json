	"body": "In the comment for the `go/types.(*Config).Check` method, it says:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCheck type-checks a package and returns the resulting package object, the first error if any, and if info != nil, additional type information.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat it does not mention is that the caller must explicitly populate any of the map fields of this type that are to be filled inâ€”it is not sufficient to simply pass a `*types.Info`. Ideally the documentation would make this explicit, say perhaps:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe type-checker populates each non-nil map field with the corresponding type information. If a given map field is nil, its information will be discarded.\r\n```\r\n\r\nor words to that effect. I'll be happy to send a PR for this (or similar), if we can agree on the wording.",
