	"body": "Some vet tests do require that the packages be built, so that vet can do type checking.  Some vet tests do not require this.  As far as I know nothing in this regard has changed since 1.6.\r\n\r\nWhat has changed here is the test.  The test looks for the function name and guesses based on the name what it does.  It looks for a set of names.  Since the 1.6 release, the following names were added: fprintln, panicln, println, sprintln.  That's why 1.6 doesn't warn.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me that this is worth fixing.  The nature of the vet program is that some errors are false positives, especially if the code has not been built.  You can disable the test for your code base with `go tool vet -printf=false`.",
