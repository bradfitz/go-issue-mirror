	"body": "For another data point, I observe that it is possible to go \u003e5x faster than the stdlib parser, if you can throw out quote handling and avoid allocations. Whenever I've needed to read large amounts of CSV-style data, I first make sure separators don't appear in the data, then no quoting is required and you can use a much simpler CSV parser. My favourites are the ASCII characters Unit Separator and Record Separator (`man ascii`, `\\x1f` \u0026 `\\x1e`), which don't usually appear in the data.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pwaller/usv/blob/master/usv.go\r\n\r\nOf course this isn't a viable option if you want to be able to read standard CSV files, but it does seem to hint that there is a big performance loss somewhere in the standard library CSV decoder.",
