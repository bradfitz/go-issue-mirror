	"body": "As reported in #9697, the pre-1.4 way to work with private repositories was to add configuration to ask Git to rewrite the URLs being generated by `go get`:\r\n\r\n``` sh\r\ngit config --global url.\"git@github.com:\".insteadOf \"https://github.com/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe initial fix for this issue in 668762c works fine for initially checking out a repository, but the fix is incomplete. `go get` continues to fail when updating a repository:\r\n\r\n``` sh\r\n$ go get -u github.com/tools/godep\r\n$ go get -u github.com/tools/godep\r\npackage github.com/tools/godep: github.com/tools/godep is a custom import path for https://github.com/tools/godep, but /Users/codemonkey/Projects/gopath/src/github.com/tools/godep is checked out from git@github.com:tools/godep\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe workaround for this is to specify `-f` to `go get`; as was noted in the prior ticket, updating scripting to specify this flag everywhere is possible but irritating.",
