	"body": "I just want to point out that while scanning open source go code is a good idea, it is not a one-to-one correspondence with the number of times this mistake has been made in the wild. Oftentimes, I imagine developers making the mistake, finding it (maybe after scratching their heads for a while like I did), and then fixing it without ever committing the broken code to version control. `go vet` can still save them trouble in this case.\r\n\r\nI also understand the desire to not make `go vet` too bloated, so getting some kind of metric for how often this happens makes sense. Would you be open to labelling this as `question` or something similar and gauging responses from the community as an additional metric for how useful this might be?",
