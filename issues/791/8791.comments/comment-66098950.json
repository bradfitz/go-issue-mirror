That explains why you are seeing that error when doing an external\nlink.\n\nSince your program uses cgo, I don't know why you are getting the external linker by\ndefault.\n\nThe error when using the internal linker is \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/8211\"\u003eissue #8211\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nOmitting the -no_pie option was a good idea, but it looks like the 10.6 linker really\ninsists on seeing PIE, and we don't generate it.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **release-none**, **os-macosx**._",
