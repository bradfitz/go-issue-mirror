When I run https://github.com/mikioh/-stdyng/tree/master/cmd/ugrmshtdwn, which is based on your snippet, I have a few different results like the following:\r\n```\r\nLinux 4.4.x:\r\n#0: 3 bytes transferred from @ to /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock\r\n#0: 3 bytes transferred to /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock from \u003cnil\u003e\r\n#1: 3 bytes transferred from @ to /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock\r\n#1: 3 bytes transferred to /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock from \u003cnil\u003e\r\none more: read unixgram /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock: i/o timeout\r\n```\r\n```\r\nOS X 10.11.x (and some BSDs maybe?):\r\n#0: 3 bytes transferred from  to /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock\r\n#0: 3 bytes transferred to /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock from \u003cnil\u003e\r\n#1: 3 bytes transferred from  to /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock\r\nclose unixgram /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock: shutdown: socket is not connected\r\n#1: 3 bytes transferred to /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock from \u003cnil\u003e\r\none more: read unixgram /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock: i/o timeout\r\n```\r\n```\r\nOther BSDs:\r\n#0: 3 bytes transferred from  to /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock\r\n#0: 3 bytes transferred to /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock from \u003cnil\u003e\r\n#1: 3 bytes transferred from  to /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock\r\n#1: 0 bytes transferred to /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock from \u003cnil\u003e\r\none more: 0 bytes transferred to /tmp/ugrmshtdwn.sock from \u003cnil\u003e\r\n```\r\nProbably the results depend on each implementation, especially the plumbing between socket layer that manages the general connection-oriented/connectionless state, and transport protocol layer that is the real conveyer.\r\n\r\nI suppose that if you really want to modify the behavior of Read, you also need to modify the behavior of CloseRead for avoiding confusion and incnsistency. I'm still not sure what we should do. At least we need to clarify three things before moving forward; 1) the desired behavior of CloseRead on unixgram socket, 2) the desired behavior of Read on cant-read-anymore unixgram socket, 3) whether we should use io.EOF as a cannot-read-anymore signal on unixgram socket, and which method should do.\r\n\r\nPS: Please change the description appropriately, like \"proposal: net: blah blah\".",
