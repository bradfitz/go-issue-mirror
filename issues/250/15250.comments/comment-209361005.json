When it is used on an \"unixgram\" socket, writes to the Unix socket fail but it is still possible to read the packets in the buffer of the socket. And I don't want to change any of these behaviors.\r\n\r\nSo to answer your questions:\r\n\r\n\u003e CloseRead method; behavior of shutdown on connectionless datagram sockets\r\n\r\nI don't want to change the current behavior.\r\n\r\n\u003e CloseWrite method; behavior of shutdown on connectionless datagram sockets\r\n\r\nI don't want to change the current behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003e Read method; meaning of io.EOF on connectionless datagram sockets: it represents... end of what?\r\n\r\nIt represents the end of incoming data since the socket cannot be written anymore.",
