I'm not sure I understand what you mean by incremental builds, but I think I'm not doing that precisely because of the git clean before each build.\r\n\r\nYou're doing a full build because of the `make.bash`, versus just touching the runtime and letting `go build` figure out that it has to rebuild things. If you repeatedly do the full build, I wouldn't expect any change because you *should* get the same binary each time, which will have the same alignment of everything. However, if you rebuild after later commits that change the compiler or runtime again (I'm not sure there have been any yet), I would expect these alignments to be perturbed again and settle back to their average \"goodness\".",
