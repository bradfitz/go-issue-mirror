The tweaked version avoids creating a whole lot of phi functions that then gets eliminated; Call merging will avoid creating a whole bunch of Copy\u003cmem\u003e that then gets eliminated.  Long run, value compaction might not be that helpful, but in the short run it looks safe and effective.\r\n",
