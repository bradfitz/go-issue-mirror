	"body": "This means one big block full of calls instead of many little CallBlocks?\r\n\r\nAnother thing Quentin just noticed (looking at giant machine-generated protobuf files) is that memory barrier ops introduce branches which generally causes sadness around phi location and generation; if we solve the rewrite-to-multiple Blocks issue, this might allow us to do general phi placement first on much larger blocks, then expand these afterwards.  One minor issue is the cost of splitting variables between Blocks and reassigning them; we'd want to do this in an order that avoids reassigning to new blocks variables as we split blocks again and again at write barriers.",
