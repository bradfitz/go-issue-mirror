Now, if there are multiple domain entries in\nresolv.conf, we will search all of them.  Actually, I think the comment may be right and\nthe code wrong.  According to \u0026quot;man resolv.conf\u0026quot; on GNU/Linux \u0026quot;The domain\nand search keywords are mutually exclusive.   If  more  than one instance of these\nkeywords is present, the last instance wins.\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e",
