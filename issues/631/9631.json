	"body": "Hi. I seem to have a nonsensical case of a function returning nil, and when the calling function imediately checks if nil, the value isn't seen as nil.\r\n\r\nThis happens on my local install of Go 1.4 (amd64/linux) and on the official Go playground.\r\n\r\nSmall example here:\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/kjusRx4MqQ\r\n\r\nI can get rid of the error by setting the variables type to *Structy, but this still seems like a bug.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAndy",
