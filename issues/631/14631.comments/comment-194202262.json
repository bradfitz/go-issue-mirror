That's the whole point of vendoring.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are several tools to check and update vendored dependencies, one example is https://github.com/divan/gofresh. It's not runtime's responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnd it's also not the right place to continue this discussion. :) Sorry.\r\n\r\nFor the record: github.com/stretchr/testify is fixed now.",
