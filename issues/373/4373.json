	"body": "by **stephen@q5comm.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI have seen the issue in 1.0.3 and from checking tip.golang.org, it is still a problem.\n\nnet.errClosing is an errors.New() that is not exported but returned to the user. This\nmeans that in order for a user to check for the \u0026quot;errClosing\u0026quot;, they need to\ncheck the error string.\n\nI suggest renaming to ErrClosing so that a client can easily check if another goroutine\nclosed it's connection.\u003c/pre\u003e",
