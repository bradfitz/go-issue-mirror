	"body": "\u003e My concern with returning io.EOF is that I think we're just being pushed there by history, and I don't find that sufficiently compelling in this case. I think if we were to look with fresh eyes and say \"what should happen if I close a net.Conn and then call the Read method\" I don't think we would reach for io.EOF.\r\n\r\nI agree, my suggestion of `io.EOF` is a compromise that will satisfy the request that self inflicted errors can be quashed. It is an abuse of `io.EOF`'s position in the `io.Reader` contract but I think justified for the case of `net.Conn.Read`.",
