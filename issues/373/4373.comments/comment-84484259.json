I remember there was an issue with an error value being masked deep down in the resolution of a URL, but I think that is a different issue to the one being discussed here.\n\n\n\n\u003e On 22 Mar 2015, at 11:53, Mikio Hara \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e \n\u003e I'm not keen on changing the existing error notification style; io.EOF and other.\n\u003e \n\u003e io.EOF indicates no data to read on the endpoint that is created as connection-oriented protocol\n\u003e In other cases, net.Error indicates whether the endpoint is still usable\n\u003e I still don't see the reason why the net package should expose some conditional value for error notification instead of fixing net/url, net/http packages.\n\u003e \n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n\u003e \n",
