This is actually the only one I've seen where it seems to make a real difference.\r\n\r\nKeith was wondering if you ought to decorate s.defvar for some of the blocks on your recursive walk.  Not nearly all, but enough to prevent quadratic badness if you had a bunch of uses far from the first def.  Say, you could iterate instead of recurse, count as you go, and then stick a def halfway to the end of the iteration if it was more than 3ish.",
