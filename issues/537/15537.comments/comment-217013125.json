On my laptop (8GB, OS X) it appears to max out at 4 simultaneous compiles each over 2G if sparse-phi is activated, but it runs to completion with only a brief instant of red in the system memory monitor.\r\n\r\nWith the sparse-phi code deactivated, at an earlier stage one of the compiles grows to 6.7G (at least -- I killed it, it did this twice in a row so it is repeatable enough for me) alongside three others, one of those over 2G and two over 1G, and the system memory monitor goes red and sticks there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
