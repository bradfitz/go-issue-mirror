	"body": "@dr2chase thinking out loud, I wonder whether instead of storing liveness as block+value pairs (which can grow quadratically), we could store it as value+[]range where range is an sdom entry/exit pair representing a subset of the CFG. In theory this could also be quadratic, if a value pops in and out of liveness, but that seems less likely.",
