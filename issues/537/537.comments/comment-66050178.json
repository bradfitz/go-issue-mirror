With this semantics, the test program attached above would correctly fail\nif the CRC \nwas wrong but incorrectly succeed if there was more data than expected.  This seems just\nas \nfragile, and both concerns are taken care of nicely by the extra Read.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
