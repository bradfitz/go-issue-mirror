Here's one example of a test that builds a binary, then runs it to test the main function: [app_test.go](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/golang-samples/blob/bbbbe266902ae707b1179ee19c2ca6df27df41c2/getting-started/bookshelf/app/app_test.go#L31-L39) (and the associated [testutil](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/golang-samples/blob/bbbbe266902ae707b1179ee19c2ca6df27df41c2/internal/testutil/runmain.go#L17))\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have that considered for code/test coverage.",
