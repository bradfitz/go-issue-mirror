	"body": "Unfortunately, in general we can't check if a method call will\npanic unless we actually invoke it.\n\nHowever, bufio.Writer is there to reduce the number of calls to\nthe underlying writer, so reliably checking problem during write\nwill defeat the whole purpose of buffered IO.\n\nAs an extreme example, if I pass a typed nil interface (i.e. if T\nimplements io.Writer, pass (*T)(nil) as the writer), we can't simply\ncheck if the interface itself is nil, and calling the Write method\nmight still panic (this depending on how T.Write is implemented).\nThus he \"random\" panic problem you describe will still happen\neven if we add the check for nil interfaces. (And this problem\nis even harder to debug than that caused by nil interfaces.)",
