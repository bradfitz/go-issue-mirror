	"body": "@minux It would preferable that all calls to a nil writer panic, rather than the inconsistent behavior encountered now. Part of the complexity of tracking this down was the fact that the `bufio.Writer` only panicked at certain times making it hard to expose the underlying issue with writer lifecycle management.\r\n\r\nI'll note that `wr.Reset` may have never actually been called in the original triggering code. This was encountered during a complex interaction where an `http.ResponseWriter` ends up as part of the reader passed to `http.NewRequest`. This report was provided with a minimal test case to trigger the same panic, which I thought was a related but different problem.\r\n\r\nThank you for looking at this tonight.",
