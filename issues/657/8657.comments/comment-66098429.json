I give you the patch. This is simple... If net.ParseIP\nfailed (ip is nil), I try to LookupIP()...\n\nIf the lookup failed the proces is the same as before. But now... It works with openssh\nand dropbear.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/8657/3/go.crypto-dropbear-fix.patch\"\u003ego.crypto-dropbear-fix.patch\u003c/a\u003e (490 bytes)",
