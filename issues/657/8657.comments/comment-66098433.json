According to\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/metal3d/idok/wiki/dropbear\"\u003ehttps://github.com/metal3d/idok/wiki/dropbear\u003c/a\u003e, you are asking for a forward of\n\"127.0.0.1\", if it succeeds, it should reply with forwards that also list the address\n\"127.0.0.1\". \n\nArguably, go.crypto/ssh should also deal with textual addresses (client.Listen(\"tcp\",\n\"localhost\"), which should expand to all available loopback interfaces, but even then\nthe server should respond with either \"::\" (ipv6) or \"127.0.0.1\" (ipv4).\n\nWe could try a bugfix for dropbear, assuming ipv4 when it replies localhost. Can you\ntell me the dropbear version string? You can find it with ssh.Conn.ServerVersion()\u003c/pre\u003e",
