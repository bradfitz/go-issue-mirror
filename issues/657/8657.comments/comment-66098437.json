I saw that dropbear 2014 is in \"unstable\" state in Debian Wheezy (raspbmc\nis using Wheezy).\n\nAuthor tells me that the next release (named OSMC) will use a new version of dropbear.\nBut I can't confirm that the bug is still present.\n\nWhat I will try is to install a docker container with debian Jessie, and test if the bug\nis there.\n\nAnyway, raspbmc is on a lot of raspberry-pi installation and users are not all\nspecialists... I guess that crypto package can hold a little fix for that kind of ssh\nserver...\u003c/pre\u003e",
