	"body": "by **hebipp1**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eOn Go 1.3, calling the Execute() function on a Template that could not be escaped due to\nan error that is returned on the first execution (for example `\u0026quot;\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot; in\nattribute name`), a panic is caused on the second execution.\n\nThis is caused by a security measure in html/template/escape.go:34, where the template\nis invalidated when the template could not be escaped. While this is documented in the\nescapeTemplates function locally, this behavior is not (at least I think so) documented\nin the public documentation of html/template.\n\nAside from that, I think this behavior should be changed to return the same error on\nevery call instead of invalidating the template.\u003c/pre\u003e",
