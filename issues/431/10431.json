	"body": "In http://golang.org/src/crypto/x509/x509.go?s=21072:21171#L611 that algorithm is not listed.\r\n\r\nShould it be listed? Is it because it is considered insecure?\r\n\r\nI've found a certificate issued with the MD5withRSA signature algorithm (used only for testing) but finding the error was really hard. It would be nice to have a better error description for this kind of failures.",
