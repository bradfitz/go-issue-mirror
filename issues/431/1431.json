Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Put this in a file named \u0026quot;get.go\u0026quot;:\n\npackage main\n\nimport \u0026quot;http\u0026quot;\n\nfunc main() {\n\t_, _, err := http.Get(\u0026quot;\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cmd/5a\u0026quot\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cmd/5a\u0026quot\u003c/a\u003e;)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tprintln(err.String())\n\t} else {\n\t\tprintln(\u0026quot;ok\u0026quot;)\n\t}\n}\n\n2. 6g get.go \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 6l get.6 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./6.out \nGet /cmd/5a/: unsupported protocol scheme \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nShould be able to fetch that page.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nCan't fetch it because that URL results in a redirect with \u0026quot;Location:\n/cmd/5a/\u0026quot;. This is against standards (redirect target should be absolute URL), but\nmany webservers have this bug, so most HTTP clients have to adjust for it (see Perl's\nlwp, for instance)\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g, but immaterial\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nLinux, but immaterial\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\n514c7ba501a1 release.2011-01-12/release\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nA proposed patch is attached, I will submit it as a CL if you think it is in the right\nballpark.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1431/0/relative.patch\"\u003erelative.patch\u003c/a\u003e (3605 bytes)",
