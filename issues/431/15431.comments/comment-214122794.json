	"body": "For some background, the reason I want to use `multipart.Reader` with an open stream is because of [Amazon's new AVS API](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service) which involves creating a long-lived HTTP/2 request that progressively receives data in the form of multipart parts.\r\n\r\nI did some experiments and the `multipart.Part`'s `Read` method seems to block on `bufio.Reader`'s `Peek` method. It doesn't seem possible to make `bufio` work with open streams that are shorter than the buffer length, so this might be tricky to fix. I even tried making a [non-blocking reader](https://gist.github.com/blixt/2160207dbcb166e3e4e414ced3af0562) to see how it would behave, but `bufio.Reader` just errors out.",
