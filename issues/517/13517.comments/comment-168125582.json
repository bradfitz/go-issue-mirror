I would also assume that if you are compiling a program, you have already picked out the version if you want a specific version, or updated to it, possibly into GOPATH first.\r\n\r\nI know version ranges are something myself and others wouldn't want to use.\r\n\r\nHowever, what I'm asking for is consensus on what might amount to a lock file. Would this proposed lock file be incompatible with a theoretical build file? The glide lock file looks compatible to me, but I could be missing something.\r\n",
