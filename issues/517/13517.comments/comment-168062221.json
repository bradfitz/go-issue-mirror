If no, then it seems like an inconsistent position.  If yes, then it seems implausible (since I can not imagine anyone ever doing that)\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, repos that are a grab bag of unrelated packages are the exception, not the rule.  Most multi-package repos are simply made to support a single functionality, and the extra packages are simply because some functionality requires a lot of code and packages are the way to organize a lot of code.  For example, robfig/soy has a high level interface in the top-level package, but provides a lot of related tools and lower level functionality in the sub-packages. It would not make sense to have some of those packages at one revision and others at a different one. ",
