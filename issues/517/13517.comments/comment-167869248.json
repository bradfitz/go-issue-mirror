Enables machine analysis of dependencies across the board, such as looking for vulnerable revisions (dvcs hashes) and mapping dependency usages.\r\n\r\n@mattfarina RE go:generate tools: I'm all ears.

Are you wanting a bin folder in the vendor folder or something similar?\r\n\r\n@mattfarina Re experience: Most of us have many years of experience vendoring of some type in go. We are transitioning to the vendor folder now. If you want a varied experience and use cases, let's talk to people now, not later. @goinggo Bill, thoughts on this? You interact with many more people than I do.\r\n",
