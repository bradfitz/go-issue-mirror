To me it seems like an import path and revision hash/tag are all that are necessary, although others probably would like something more complicated. This is why I opened https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13483, because for me getting a dependency at a specified rev using standard Go tools is all I want.\r\n\r\nThe capability to easily create the simple Godeps (gpm) file is _almost_ in the [go/build](https://golang.org/pkg/go/build/) and [vcs](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/go/vcs) packages already. What we still need are:\r\n\r\n- Ability to determine currently checked-out rev of each import (similar to https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/go/vcs#Cmd.Tags)\r\n- Ability to determine built-in vs 3rd-party imports (already can get _all_ imports: https://golang.org/pkg/go/build/#Package)",
