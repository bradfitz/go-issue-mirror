So I will quote it and say I agree with it:\r\n\r\n\u003e Versions are not an attribute of packages, they are an attribute of repositories. Therefore, at even the most rudimentary, vendor spec suffers from what is called \"level confusion\" -- the assigning of attributes to the wrong \"level\" of abstraction.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I would want to hear good arguments for doing it another way. But assigning versions to repo roots seems like the most natural and effective solution.",
