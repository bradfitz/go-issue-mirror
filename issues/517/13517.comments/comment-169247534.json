(If they could, I'd agree with you - no question, they'd be the way to go) At best, they can determine that code is not incompatible, not that it is compatible. Annoyingly, these are different things. Here's an example.\r\n\r\nSemver **may not catch** any of those, but code analysis would at least catch the v2 issue (as you stated code analysis can only tell me what's incompatible). Tests, as you, me and/or others have pointed out above would be required to catch the v3 issue, semver or not.\r\n\r\nThis is the crux of our disagreement AFAICT: You have faith in semver being meaningful beyond stating intent. I don't. In my mind semver is **just** intent and I would prefer to consider actual API changes and leave the rest to integration testing. We both view the world very differently apparently. Your article will be an interesting read for me I'm sure. :-)\r\n\r\nI would love to get some sort of higher throughput (video / in person / etc) discussion wrt this issue. It's obvious that we all care deeply about it. Barring that I'll probably start bringing it up with every go developer I cross paths with.",
