	"body": "Sure, I know that and you know that and anyone can eventually get to that conclusion, my observation is that the explanation is confusing, specially for newcomers. Why to save in explanations and not making it very clear?, something like:\r\n\"Variables can be declared without specifying its type explicitly (using the var x = {value} syntax or the := syntax), in these cases, the variable's type is inferred from the value on the right hand side of the declaration.\"\r\nThen, in the examples, use:\r\nvar i = 42        // int\r\nj := 42           // int\r\n\r\n\"without a type\" sounds like you can actually define a var \"without a type\". It is an initial tour, then why leading people to confusion when it can be very easily explained?",
