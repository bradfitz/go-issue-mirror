Once the incoming packets hit your firewall, it's too lateâ€”they've already clogged your connection. (I have actually encountered a situation where miscellaneous  IP packets from who knows where were consuming most of a site's incoming bandwidth. All I could do about it was tell them to contact their ISP.)\r\n\r\n\u003e HTTP flood do not use malformed packets, spoofing or reflection techniques, and require less bandwidth than other attacks to bring down the targeted site or server.\r\n\r\nThe technique that article was talking about does not saturate the network connection. It consumes memory, CPU, etc. on the server. That's why it takes less bandwidth than other attacks.",
