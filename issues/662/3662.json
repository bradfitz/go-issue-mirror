Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1.\nrun this on windows x86_64 and it will crash\ni am using mingw64 and i compiled sdl 1.2.15 and glew using the mingw compiler. I\nfollowed this guide \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-3.0.0-BETA/mingw64_how_to.html\"\u003ehttp://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-3.0.0-BETA/mingw64_how_to.html\u003c/a\u003e\nto setup mingw\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nit should display a line that runs infinite loop \n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nwindows 7 x86_64\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo 1.0.1\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nthe function f() made from the c side works for some reason. If it call the function\nC.f() from go everything works fine. But if i do it on separate lines such as \n\nC.glBegin(...)\nC.glEnd() and call those from go like in the example, it crashes, I stepped through it\nand it seems to crash at the call of gl.Vertex2i call.\n\nFor some reason this works fine on another windows computer i tested out. This also\nworks on linux, but for some reason this computer crashes when doing this sort of thing. \n\nsome specific windows spec: amd a6-3420M APU with radeon hd graphics 1.5 ghz\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3662/0/test.go\"\u003etest.go\u003c/a\u003e (1109 bytes)",
