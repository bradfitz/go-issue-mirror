For example, if the Go program were\n\nfunc main() {\n    runtime.LockOSThread()\n    println(\"f\")\n    C.f()\n    println(\"g\")\n    C.g()\n}\n\nand it prints f, g, does as much work as possible in f, but crashes\nduring C.g, that's something we can work with.  For example I'd try\nreplacing the for loop with just the body (so it runs once) and then\nput everything before the Vertex2i call in f and the rest in g.  If\nthat crashes in g, the next step would be to put debugging prints in\nboth f and g to print the current thread id during both calls.  That\nwould tell us whether LockOSThread is working on your system.\n\nIf you cannot split your C code into two functions f and g such that g\nis the one that crashes, that's also interesting.  It tells us that\nmaybe the problem is the C call to Vertex2i in particular, that\nthere's something about that function signature we don't understand so\nthat we are invoking it incorrectly.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
