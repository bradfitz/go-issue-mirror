There is already a dependency graph in the tool, and\nif there are things that should not be run at the same time, you can introduce\ndependencies to ensure that. It's fine to run the builds in parallel, and\nsetting -p=1 would stop that.\n\nCode already exists in cmd/go to do this:\n\n\t// If we are benchmarking, force everything to\n\t// happen in serial.  Could instead allow all the\n\t// builds to run before any benchmarks start,\n\t// but try this for now.\n\tif testBench {\n\t\tfor i, a := range builds {\n\t\t\tif i \u003e 0 {\n\t\t\t\t// Make build of test i depend on\n\t\t\t\t// completing the run of test i-1.\n\t\t\t\ta.deps = append(a.deps, runs[i-1])\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\nWhat is wrong with that code?\u003c/pre\u003e",
