It should first check if it has the required param before\ndefaulting to zero.\n\nnet/http/fcgi uses cgi.RequestFromMap, and therefor is also affected.\n\nA simple patch is attached.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/8351/0/remote_port.patch\"\u003eremote_port.patch\u003c/a\u003e (707 bytes)",
