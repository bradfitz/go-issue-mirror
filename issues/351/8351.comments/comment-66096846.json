Apache\n2.2, Apache 2.4, nginx, and lighttpd all set REMOTE_PORT.\n\nI originally dug deeper to see if we could remove the logic of setting the port to zero\nif REMOTE_PORT was unset, but because the spec does not mandate it, we must do the check.\n\nLastly, while it is generally useless to criticize a finalized RFC, I find it very odd\nthat the CGI spec specifies both REMOTE_ADDR and REMOTE_HOST. The latter of which wants\na DNS lookup. On top of that I can't find a server that does pass the REMOTE_HOST param,\ndespite it being something that \"SHOULD\" be set according to the RFC. As such I can't\nfind a single widely used webserver that follows the spec religiously.\u003c/pre\u003e",
