Every call into \nC might happen in a different OS thread, which means\nthat referring to errno directly is not guaranteed to\nget the value you want.\n\nInstead, use a two-element return from any C function to\nget both the result and the error code atomically.\nSee \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cmd/cgo/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cmd/cgo/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI will change cgo to print an error when it sees C.errno.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
