Use a https://golang.org/pkg/io/#TeeReader to save the bytes read into a https://golang.org/pkg/bytes/#Buffer and then if you're happy with the dimensions, use https://golang.org/pkg/io/#MultiReader to stitch together the saved header buffer with the remaining jpeg io.Reader. It all takes a few lines and is the natural Go composable way. See Camlistore's codebase for an example.\r\n",
