In fact, we use r0 as a scratch register in GCC all the time, as well as when we save/restore the link register in the prologue/epilogue.\r\n\r\nThat said, there are instructions where the contents of r0 are ignored and the value zero is used instead.  For example, the base register in load and store instructions and addi and addis, etc. but only if r0 is the RA operand.  If r0 isn't reset whenever r0 is used like calling non GO routines (eg, C), or whenever making syscalls (r0 holds the syscall number), then you can't guarantee that r0 is zero.\r\n",
