	"title": "cmd:  incorrect assembly of CMP Rn,$0 on ppc64le/ppc64",
	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo 1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nlinux ppc64le\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nI'm working on updating some asm file changes to improve performance on ppc64le.  I see many\r\nfiles that contain CMP Ra,$0 that generate the wrong ppc64 assembler.   I'm guessing that the contents of r0 is usually 0 and that is allowing these to work by luck.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nFor an ASM like this:\r\nCMP  R3,$0\r\nthe code should be\r\ncmpdi r3,0\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\ncmpd r3,r0\r\n\r\nThis is from an objdump:\r\n\r\nTEXT runtimeÂ·memeqbody(SB),NOSPLIT,$0-0\r\n       ......\r\n        CMPU    R5,$0\r\n   757ac:       40 00 25 7c     cmpld   r5,r0\r\n\r\nHowever if the value is not 0, then it assembles correctly\r\n\r\n        CMP     R5,$32      \r\n   757b4:       20 00 25 2c     cmpdi   r5,32\r\n\r\n\r\n",
