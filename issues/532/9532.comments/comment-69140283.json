	"body": "It's not just a one-shot problem. It's an ongoing thing. Once you've got this kind of package in your `$GOPATH`, `go get -u` forces you to use the canonical remote, which needs to be the public one, which makes it worse for the developer wanting to push. I guess you could tell them that they can't use `go get -u` on packages they develop, but that seems lame.\r\n\r\nIt's not a lot of complexity. The implementation would be a trivial bit more parsing (`strings.Split` on spaces, then do a containment check instead of using `==`), and it has zero impact on import tags that don't care about it.",
