That's why we don't offer\nflags to disable \"annoying\" unused variable/import errors.)\n\nThe author of a package always need to do something special for\nthe git repo to be able to push anyway: be it another go get\nflag (and he also needs to clone from another location) or\ngit config (remote.origin.pushurl, or branch.*.pushremote), so I\ndon't think the extra cmd/go flag or extra remotes in meta tag\ncould solve the O(M*N) problem. (unless we make go get somehow\nclone from the git: URL by default.)\n\nI just checked that the author can simply set\ngit config remote.origin.pushurl git@github.com/robpike/filter.git\n\nand then he can push without problem, and go get -u won't bark,\nthis is a per-repo setting, so i think it's better than the pushInsteadOf\nworkaround (unless you have multiple clones of the same repo.)",
