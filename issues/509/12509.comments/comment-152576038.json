	"body": "@rsc, how is this a Go1.6 issue? It's not released with Go.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it's not exactly clear how this should work. Should a flake make it fire? Do you need N failures in a row first? What if the N failures in a row are different? How do you detect they're different? Parsing the text?\r\n\r\nThe easiest thing is to ignore flakes and just say any transition from ok to failure emails.\r\n\r\nI suppose the coordinator could poll http://build.golang.org/?mode=json occasionally and post to Gerrit (which emails), since the coordinator already can post to Gerrit. By asking for the data from build.golang.org it would also catch builders like old-style builders like netbsd and solaris, which report directly to build.golang.org.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer if people just don't break the build, though, so I've been spending my builder time primarily on making trybots better.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to review code to resurrect this, though. I'm not sure where it lives before, or if it even makes sense to reuse any of the code. @adg?\r\n",
