It's not\n\u003e released with Go.\n\u003e\n\u003e In any case, it's not exactly clear how this should work. Should a flake\n\u003e make it fire? Do you need N failures in a row first? What if the N failures\n\u003e in a row are different? How do you detect they're different? Parsing the\n\u003e text?\n\u003e\n\u003e The easiest thing is to ignore flakes and just say any transition from ok\n\u003e to failure emails.\n\u003e\n\u003e I suppose the coordinator could poll http://build.golang.org/?mode=json\n\u003e occasionally and post to Gerrit (which emails), since the coordinator\n\u003e already can post to Gerrit. By asking for the data from build.golang.org\n\u003e it would also catch builders like old-style builders like netbsd and\n\u003e solaris, which report directly to build.golang.org.\n\u003e\n\u003e I'd prefer if people just don't break the build, though, so I've been\n\u003e spending my builder time primarily on making trybots better.\n\u003e\n\u003e I'm happy to review code to resurrect this, though. I'm not sure where it\n\u003e lives before, or if it even makes sense to reuse any of the code. @adg\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/adg\u003e?\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/12509#issuecomment-152576038\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
