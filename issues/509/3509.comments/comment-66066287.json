Sometimes, this goes into an\ninfinite loop. After it has marked the last string or comment in a range, it begins\nagain at the beginning of the range.\n\nThis happens when you copy some text from within a comment or string and paste is to\nsomething outside comment or string that is after the location where you copied it from.\n\nIt does not happen when you copy from string or comment into string or comment. Neither\ndoes it happen when you copy to a location that is before where you copied it from, but\nthe syntax coloring may be wrong until you edit the start of the line where you copied\nto.\n\nI haven't been able to fix it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
