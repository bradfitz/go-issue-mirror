	"body": "Currently the default implementations of net.Addr.Network() functions in the net package return hard-coded strings representing the network type as below. This means that callers wanting to check the return value of these functions also have to hard-code these in their own code with the possibilities of typos leading to possibility of bugs.\r\n- `IPAddr.Network()  : \"ip\"`\r\n- `IPNet.Network() : \"ip+net\"`\r\n- `TCPAddr.Network() : \"tcp\"`\r\n- `UDPAddr.Network() : \"udp\"`\r\n- `UnixAddr.Network() : \"unix\" or \"unixgram\" or \"unixpacket\"`\r\n \r\nIf we expose these default return strings as package constants and have functions use the constants instead of hard-coded strings, callers can compare function return values against constants and be protected against these types of bugs. This would also be fully backwards-compatible. \r\n\r\nA block of constants will also serve as a useful single point of reference in the documentation for these functions as currently we need to jump around the documentation to understand what each implementation returns. \r\n\r\nHappy to work out a CL for this",
