	"title": "runtime: decide if we should mention cl 17164 change in go1.6.html",
	"body": "From the change:\r\n```\r\nruntime: do not call timeBeginPeriod on windows\r\nCalling timeBeginPeriod changes Windows global timer resolution\r\nfrom 15ms to 1ms. This used to improve Go runtime scheduler\r\nperformance, but not anymore. Thanks to @aclements, scheduler now\r\nbehaves the same way if we call timeBeginPeriod or not.\r\n\r\nRemove call to timeBeginPeriod, since it is machine global\r\nresource, and there are downsides of using low timer resolution.\r\nSee issue #8687 for details.\r\n\r\nFixes #8687\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome users might be affected - whoever prefer time.Sleep(time.Nanosecond) to sleep for 1ms, instead of 15ms. I would rather our users use Windows system as is, but, I suspect, sometimes it is important.\r\n\r\nLeaving for others to decide what to do / say here. Thank you.\r\n\r\nAlex",
