	"body": "I would rather fix this with documentation (about ListenAndServe doing the keep-alive stuff), and ideally not much documentation. I don't want to add more API surface.\r\n\r\nThe net and net/http packages are large enough. The small percentage of people needing custom listeners can code up exactly what they want. Once we added some sort of keep-alive-listener type, then the question would be how to configure it. Best to just let people write the thing they want. It's not much code.\r\n\r\n/cc @adg since it's a proposal\r\n",
