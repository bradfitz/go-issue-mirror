	"body": "by **gconnell@google.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI've been doing some work grabbing x509 certs out of SSL traffic and processing them. \nRecently, I've seen some certs from 2a03:2880:10:8f01:face:b00c:0:26 (facebook) that the\nx509 package can't seem to process.  I'm not sure if this is because the cert is bad or\nbecause there's an issue with the x509 package, but I thought I'd drop it here and see\nif someone wants to take a look.\n\nNOTE:  This is the 3rd cert served by facebook in the SSL handshake.  The first 2 alone\nare enough to validate the certificate chain against a root CA.\n\nNOTE 2:  I'm really unfamiliar with certificates myself, so I went no farther than\n\u0026quot;It can't parse \u0026lt;sad face\u0026gt;\u0026quot;.  It could be a very simple issue.\n\n\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/uS9Irdg_4r\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/uS9Irdg_4r\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nI was hoping the x509 cert would parse.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nX509 parsing error: ASN.1 structure error: tags don't match (16 vs {class:0 tag:1\nlength:0 isCompound:false}) {optional:false explicit:false application:false\ndefaultValue:\u0026lt;nil\u0026gt; tag:\u0026lt;nil\u0026gt; stringType:0 set:false omitEmpty:false}\nAlgorithmIdentifier @945\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nlinux\n\nWhich version are you using?
