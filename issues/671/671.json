[...] (Closing the connection\n     cannot be used to indicate the end of a request body, since that\n     would leave no possibility for the server to send back a response.)\n\nRight now (hg identify = c79efd9bd2de+ tip), doing req.Body.Read() (with\nreq being a http.Request given by http.ListenAndServe) will hang for\nHTTP/1.0 GET requests (or HTTP/1.1 GET requests with the Connection:close\nheader). Following the above advice fix this miror problem (see attached\npatch for a “proof”)\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/671/0/dont-close-request-body.diff\"\u003edont-close-request-body.diff\u003c/a\u003e (1036 bytes)",
