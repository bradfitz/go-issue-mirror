None of current tests fail - so why are we changing code\nthen? You're also changing many lookup functions, why you only changing LookupNS test\nonly? Please, add tests for all others that fail now but will get PASSed once your\npackage changes are applied.\n\nLike I said earlier, I would just use nslookup to test everything properly. You can try\nto use nslookup if available and works. Do not fail the test, if you don't find nslookup\nor if it fails. I am not sure about using nslookup on non-windows platforms. Surely it\nwon't work on plan9.\n\nNone of these tests run by the builder - builder only runs \"go test -short\". So new\ntests won't slow anyone down, but just people who care about this code.\n\nAlso please don't remove old tests (like gmail.com), maybe create a little table of\nhostnames you would like to test, and test them in a loop. I would leave current tests\nalone, and write all new tests with nslookup to run on windows only in a new test file.\n\nIf it is too much for you, I will do it myself. I need proper tests before I would agree\nwe are making correct changes.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
