Fix is good, but I think we should fix our tests first - tests\nlet us down - tests didn't complain about our problem. I think we should test more\nhosts, the ones that fail. I also think we should use \"nslookup -querytype=ns\nwww.golang.com\" command to fetch results during the test - this way we can actually\nverify that all our results are correct. Perhaps we should create new windows specific\ntests to keep non-windows tests simple (I don't see how non-windows code could be\nincorrect here). Would you like to do all that as part of your fix?\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **os-windows**, **release-go1.4**._\n\n_Owner changed to @alexbrainman._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
