Would [\"mail.golang.com\",\n\"gmail.com\"] be sufficient? Or should there also be a third server that as more than 1\nCNAME redirect in it? Currently I wasn't able to find one.\n\nInstead of nslookup, it could use things in dnsmsg.go to do the queries in pure Go. Of\ncourse that would be much larger change and probably out of my competence.\u003c/pre\u003e",
