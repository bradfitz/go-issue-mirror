	"body": "This bug is about the non-Linux (but still x86) part of http://golang.org/s/builderplan\r\n\r\nThe current build coordinator (x/tools/dashboard/coordinator) only runs builds in Docker containers. These are what https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/DashboardBuilders calls the \"New-style\" builders.\r\n\r\nThey're only Linux configs, though.\r\n\r\nTo run non-Linux OSes, we want to run VMs as well. This bug is about adding support to run builds in VMs on GCE (so x86 only)\r\n\r\nThe first part was recently done in https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/2180/ which added the buildlet. The buildlet runs on each VM (Windows, Plan 9, Open BSD, etc) and provides remote command execution and file extraction over HTTP.  This is the interface that the coordinator will then use instead of docker for VM-based builds.\r\n\r\nSpecific bugs have been filed for each operating system moving to this new scheme:\r\n\r\nFreeBSD is #8639\r\nOpenBSD is #8642 (furthest along)\r\nWindows is #8640\r\nPlan 9 is #9491\r\n",
