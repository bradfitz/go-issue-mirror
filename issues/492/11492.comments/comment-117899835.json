	"body": "Thanks for the explanation, @rsc. Simply I wanted to allow us to mix features under the hood, various hardware-offloading stuff, new extensions for transport protocols and routing metrics for transport path selection, in existing network applications. For that purpose I needed to find out some way injecting unknown socket address and endpoint types in the standard library into runtime-integrated network poller.\r\n\r\n\u003e perhaps we can put a registration mechanism in package syscall...\r\n\r\nIf it does make sense and is possible, I'm happy to revert the current change and will take the approach in Go 1.6.",
