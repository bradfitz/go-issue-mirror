It looks like only glibc passes (argc, argv, envp) to the DSO init functions.\r\n\r\nIf we want to detect glibc at build time, it seems like we can include `\u003climits.h\u003e` and test for `defined(__GLIBC__) \u0026\u0026 !defined(__UCLIBC__)`.  (The User-Agent saga continues as uClibc claims to be glibc.)\r\n\r\nTo detect at runtime, we could use a weak reference to a glibc-only symbol like gnu_get_libc_version and see if it resolves.  I'm worried about making sure we pick a symbol that won't later be implemented by other C libraries though.  (E.g., I found a thread where someone suggested adding a gnu_get_libc_version function to musl to make it compatible with Nvidia's binary drivers.)\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions/ideas for detecting glibc?",
