Honestly, my preference would be for a 3rd way - if the word is not encoded, just return it.. that would mirror what WordEncoder does, and would be what I would expect to work.  But I think that may not be possible with the backwards compatibility guarantee.  \r\n\r\nBarring that, an IsEncoded function would be a nice alternate, so I could know if I need to try to Decode at all. The problem with calling it CanDecode is that if it returns false, I wonder if it actually is encoded, but incorrectly or something.  IsEncoded is more clear, IMO. Obviously, it may still be encoded in some way that the Decoder doesn't understand, but as far as the Decoder is concerned, that's still \"not encoded\".",
