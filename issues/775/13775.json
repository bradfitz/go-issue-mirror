It appears that comments are recognized *only* if they have no leading spaces. See test case here:  https://play.golang.org/p/m8GfvFWiEc\r\nThis is a modified version of the ReadAll() example: https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/csv/#example_Reader_ReadAll\r\nIf this is expected/defined behavior, it might be worth adding a note to the documentation or example on golang.org.\r\n\r\n",
