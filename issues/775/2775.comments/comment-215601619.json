	"body": "I submitted the CL. We will note that it is experimental in the release notes.\r\n\r\nTo reply briefly to some points:\r\n\r\n- It doesn't work to be a build tag. Build tags are about selection of files to compile, not about changing the meaning of the compilation. Independent concerns, independent mechanisms. And //go: for prefixes is the established standard for source annotations directed at the go toolchain (but we're not going to retroactively change // +build).\r\n- If the binary-only package has the wrong imports inside it, likely the best way to address that would be to go back to the person who sold you the package and get them fixed. But you could also rewrite the binary form to change import paths if needed. I am skeptical it will come to that. And note that if you're happy with the imports being used in the binary-only package, you can choose your own import path for it simply by moving it somewhere else in the file system.\r\n- I don't think there's anything interesting about vendoring here except that it's one rationale for wanting a different import path.\r\n- If any tools want to not support these binary blobs, that's fine with me: you can say \"go get doesn't support them either.\"",
