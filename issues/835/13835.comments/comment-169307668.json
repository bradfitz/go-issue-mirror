	"body": "For what little it's worth, I did look into the topic of Unicode host names when working on url.Parse earlier in the cycle. Go 1.4 and earlier preserved them as is. Go 1.5 %-encoded the non-ASCII bytes (clearly not right). Go 1.6 goes back to the earlier preservation. For URL parsing the general rule is that the fields of the URL struct are unencoded, so it seemed best to keep Host in its original form, especially in non-web uses of URLs (like when people use mysql://whatever).\r\n\r\nI looked at what seemed to be relevant RFCs at the time and it looked like the HTTP protocol needed one algorithm for mangling to ASCII while DNS needed a different one. Maybe I misunderstood, but that split seemed another argument in favor of keeping the URL.Host field unmangled, and for keeping URL.String() unmangled at least for now.\r\n\r\nI agree that we should figure out how to make http.Get etc do the right thing. Internally http.Get already calls url.Parse, so if there is http-specific url mangling to do, it can be done there.\r\n\r\nSimilarly we should figure out how to make net.Dial do the right thing, whatever that is.",
