	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat does 'go version' print?\n\ngo version go1.3.1 windows/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n1. Run \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/mtWFU1M8-G\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/mtWFU1M8-G\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat happened?\n\nFive tests fail.\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nNo tests fail.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nWhen printing a composite type containing values that implement fmt.Formatter and using\nformat strings such as \u0026quot;%+v\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;%#v\u0026quot;, the type's Format(f\nfmt.State, c rune) method is called such that f.Flag('+') == false and f.Flag('#') ==\nfalse.\n\nI couldn't find any tests cases that exercise this combination of features and the\ndocumentation seems ambiguous on this particular usage. The package documentation only\ngives special exemptions to %T and %p with regard to implementing fmt.Formatter. It\nwould seem when printing a composite structure that did not itself implement\nfmt.Formatter, but contained values that did, that a \u0026quot;%+v\u0026quot; or a\n\u0026quot;%#v\u0026quot; format should apply to each contained value just as a \u0026quot;%+q\u0026quot; or\na \u0026quot;%#x\u0026quot; does.\n\nNote that when printing individual values the '+' and '#' flags *are* discoverable, it\nis only when the value is reached indirectly through a composite value that the '+' and\n'#' flags are not passed on (and only for the 'v' verb).\u003c/pre\u003e",
