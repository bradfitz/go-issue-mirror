	"body": "Thanks @ianlancetaylor, #4056 does include a lot of discussion on this topic. The current summary seems to be that it is preferred for the runtime to abort here rather than have the potential for code to deadlock and users should manage their goroutines to prevent this from happening.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'm going to close this bug and open a new one just about letting go code read the current thread limit so that user code is able to use this information when managing their goroutines.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
