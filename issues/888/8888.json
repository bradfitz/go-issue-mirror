	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIf we split data/bss into 4K chunks, then it will improve parallelization of scanning\nand make it more incremental (something we need for concurrent GC with GOMAXPROCS=1).\nI've done it once, but it was reverted during precision changes.\nWhen we have 1-bit/word pointer info, it will be trivial to restore:\n1. Calculate number of 4K chunks.\n2. Adjust scanning parfor boundary accordingly.\n3. If a thread's parfor iteration index is data/bss scanning, it finds the relevant\npiece of data/bass and relevant piece of data/bss pointer info and scans only that piece.\u003c/pre\u003e",
