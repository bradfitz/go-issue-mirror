	"body": "\r\n**What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?**\r\n\r\n`go version go1.6.2 darwin/amd64`\r\n\r\n**What did you do?**\r\nI want to upload svg file to aws s3. I use `http.DetectContentType(buffer)` to get the content type.\r\nI really want the `http.DetectContentType(buffer)`; back `image/svg+xml` replace `text/xml; charset=utf-8`. Because the browser don't show the svg images when `\u003cimg src=\"s3/a-svg-file.svg\"\u003e` if you give browser ContentType: `text/xml; charset=utf-8`.\r\nI think it's more suit for web develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\n `image/svg+xml`\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the function out of `http.DetectContentType(buffer)` scope or you have suggestions for me. Welcome to reply.\r\nThank you very much and sorry for my bad English.\r\n\r\n",
