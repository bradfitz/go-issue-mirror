It's the logarithmic formula here:\n\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_function#Logarithmic_forms\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_function#Logarithmic_forms\u003c/a\u003e\n(you can re-express that equation in terms for hyperbolic functions and Arg, but it's\nthe same thing).\n\nTo see why it is inconsistent, try putting 0.5 and 2 in the logarithmic version (gives\npositive for both 0.5 and 2) and compare them with Python's output (positive for 0.5,\nnegative for 2).\n\nThe choice of signature must not depend on the argument, so there musn't be anything\nlike \"for x\u0026lt;=1 I'm choosing a positive sign in the logarithmic formula but x\u0026gt;1 I'm\nsuddenly going to introduce an extra sign at the beginning of the formula\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
