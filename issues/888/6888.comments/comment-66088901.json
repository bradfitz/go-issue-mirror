I do not expect Acos(2+0i)\nand Acos(2-0i) to be equal, just like I do not expect 1/-0 and 1/+0 to be equal.\n\nI do expect Acos(2+0i) to correspond to the mathematical limit of Acos(2+εi) when ε is\na positive number going to zero.\n\nSimilarly I do expect sqrt(-x+0i) and sqrt(-x-0i) to be different numbers (for real x \u003e\n0), because in the second case -x-0i belongs to the lower half complex plane thus its\nsquare root must be -sqrt(3)i, whereas -x+0i belongs to the upper half plane and thus\nsqrt(-3+0i) is sqrt(3)i. There is no mathematical mistake here, and this behaviour is\ntotally mathematically logic and coherent, and matches the specification given by ISO\n10967-3 norm.\n\nI have no problem with Mathematica not having the notion of a negative zero, which does\nnot belong to floating-point arithmetic. And we are indeed talking about floating-point\nnumbers, not real numbers or complex numbers with real coefficients.\u003c/pre\u003e",
