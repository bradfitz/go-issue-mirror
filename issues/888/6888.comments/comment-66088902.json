If it doesn't agree with the analytic result, it's wrong. It's\nthat simple. Floating points, computer implements, they all have errors. If you get the\nsign totally wrong, then it's a problem with the implementation, not mathematics.\n\nAnd let me add that acos *has* as discontinuity when passing the boundary on the\nimaginary part when the real part is greater than 1, so it's no revelations, and there\nis nothing wrong. See the plot in \"Properties \u0026 Relations\"\n\u003ca href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/ArcCosh.html\"\u003ehttp://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/ArcCosh.html\u003c/a\u003e\nfor instance.\n\nAnyway. Really. Think/believe as you like. I tried to explain. It's not my\nresponsibility to get it right anyway.\u003c/pre\u003e",
