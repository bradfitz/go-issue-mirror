Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1.  go build -x -work -gccgoflags '-lgvc' -compiler gccgo test.go\n2.  ./test\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nnothing for this stub - an error free exit\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nfatal error: DWARF underflow in .debug_info at 4\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\ngccgo\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux: kernel-3.11.8-300.fc20.x86_64\n\nWhich version are you using?

The backtrace library that gccgo uses does\nnot yet understand separate debug info packages.
