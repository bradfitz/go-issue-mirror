	"body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI tried to use the log/syslog package under windows and i've seen that it is not available, even when i tried to use it with a windows compatible protocol like udp.\r\n\r\nAfter checking the sources i noticed that the package is not actually compiled for windows.\r\n```\r\n// +build !windows,!nacl,!plan9\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found a way to patch it. I compiled the syslog.go file for windows and moved the call to UnixSyslog in the syslog_unix.go file. This doesn't change the behaviour under a linux platform and permits the support of some protocols under windows.\r\n\r\nI already have forked the package and patched/tested it. \r\n\r\nGo Version : 1.4.x\r\nOS \u0026 processor architecture : linux/amd64 and windows/amd64\r\n",
