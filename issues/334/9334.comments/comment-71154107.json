In that case the new stuff should support not only for dual-stack TCP listeners but for SCTP, MPTCP listeners.\r\n\r\nRandom thoughts on API:\r\n* New interface such as MultiListener seems reasonable\r\n* It would also implement Listener interface\r\n* Addr method of MultiListener returns a list of addresses, or always returns the first address\r\n\r\nRandom thoughts on testing:\r\n* We can make a small, dedicated testbed network by using builders (even though GCE not support IPv6 yet)\r\n* The testbed would also be useful for testing some layer's keep-alive, recovery scenarios\r\n\r\nRandom thoughts on roadmap:\r\n* For now, adding a concrete type into the net package seems wrong\r\n* We need to make a easy way to inject external types that implement Conn, Addr interface into the net package for keeping the package small\r\n* Most hard part would be to re-plumb runtime-integrated network poller\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6458\r\n* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6897\r\n\r\nPS: Moreover, I'd want to see what happens with the IP Stack Evolution Program: http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/91/slides/slides-91-iab-techplenary-6.pdf\r\n",
