There do exist dual-stack systems which don't support dual-stack sockets, so AF_INET and AF_INET6 must be kept separate.  In that case, `Listen` falls back to IPv4, which is suboptimal.\r\n\r\n\u003e for each IP that the hostname resolve to, that is a higher-level thing\r\n\r\nIf `Listen` didn't accept hostnames then I'd agree with you, but hostnames are accepted, and with great power comes great responsibility.  Arbitrarily picking one IP address just isn't right.  If the \"prefer IPv4\" bug were fixed, then localhost listeners would flip to ::1 only, which would surprise a lot of people.",
