	"body": "@vogtd Thanks for the patch. The way I solved the issue with RawSockaddrUnix in gc was by casting the byte array being written to, as shown on line 304 [here](https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z/go/blob/46de9aa2c9e3969404e120ac5715832ebc472e52/src/syscall/syscall_linux.go#LC304). Doing this avoids having to write different versions of the function for different platforms. What do you think?\r\n\r\n@laboger Yes, what you said is correct. I have checked the history; the code was added for ARM in [this commit](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/9691312e5318ca2e0ffc6bb0bd1b37afe69e721e). Should we keep doing this for all char types on all platforms where the default is not signed? I don't think it makes sense to handle sockaddr.sa_data one way and sockaddr_un.sun_path a different way. @davecheney @rsc, any comment?",
