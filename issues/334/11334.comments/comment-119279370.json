	"body": "The trouble seems to be [here](https://golang.org/src/time/format.go?s=21116:21162#L162).  The code is assuming that _2 is a date example.  So, the next token it finds is \"006\".  That's unrecognized by the [zero pattern](https://golang.org/src/time/format.go?s=21116:21162#L145), so the error is thrown.\r\n\r\nNot sure how to fix this.  The whole model of specification-by-example seems curious to me.  Suppose I (oddly enough, admittedly) wanted to use the sequence \"02\" as my separator - in an example it would look like this: `Mon02Jan022022006` which is unparsable. ",
