	"body": "When viewing examples in godoc, a function called ExampleABC that doesn't match any of the suffix patterns described here\r\n\r\n  http://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Examples\r\n\r\nis silently excluded.  I would have expected it to be associated with the package.\r\n\r\nThe -ex flag makes no difference.\r\n\r\nYou can see an example in the x/tools repo, if you sync to 9c57c19a58835b00c0e3e283952087842242e49b and look at golang.org/x/tools/go/loader.  The follow-up change, 41d9a0e7b2d60d52ef1caf232b081c16af220b44, renames the examples to make them visible.\r\n",
