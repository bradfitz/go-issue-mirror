Even running under gdb, interrupting, and issuing 'goroutine \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; bt' for\nthe two goroutines 1 and 2 shows only Go scheduler and memory allocation activity, with\nrare exceptions.  (Presumably it's not tail-optimising the call and is allocating new\nframes forever.)\n\n(This is a minimized testcase from a larger program in which the number of calls in the\ncycle was nontrivial and therefore much harder to guess at.)\n\n% go version\ngo version devel +ab868a8f3128 Thu Nov 08 16:07:05 2012 -0500\n% uname -a \nLinux adonovan.nyc.corp.google.com 2.6.38.8-gg987 #2 SMP Fri Sep 14 03:37:11 PDT 2012\nx86_64 GNU/Linux\u003c/pre\u003e",
