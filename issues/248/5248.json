	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI'm preparing a talk using present that demonstrates the output of panics and the\ndeadlock detector.  The stack traces show line numbers like:\ngoroutine 1 [running]:\nmain.main()\n\t/tmp/compile5.go:20 +0x11f\n\nBut it's difficult to cross-reference these against the code displayed on the slide. \nDisplaying line numbers for .code and .play segments would address this issue (the\nfilename doesn't matter).  The key point here is that the displayed line numbers must\nmatch those in the file delivered to the compiler (e.g., omitting any \u0026quot;OMIT\u0026quot;\ncomments), not the lines in the segment selected by the .code or .play START/STOP\nregexps.\u003c/pre\u003e",
