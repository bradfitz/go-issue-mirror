See how recover is called:\n\nn = mkcall(\"recover\", n-\u003etype, init, nod(OADDR, nodfp, N));\n\nYou could pass \u0026FP to racefuncenter and use pointer arithmetic in the runtime to get the\nreturn address. You could also use directly -widthptr(FP) by cloning nodfp and setting\nxoffset to -widthptr, I guess.\u003c/pre\u003e",
