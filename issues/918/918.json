	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eFile is used in Dup* and ForkExec. Conn is used to create connections, either pipes, UDP\nconnections, TCP connections, and so on. There is a disconnect between these constructs.\nIt should be possible to substitute a Conn in many places where a File is used, e.g. in\nDup or ForkExec; it currently is not. I have suggested a simple patch in 1711047, but\nthis change is somewhat unsatisfying because the Pipe type has four fds; which one of\nthese should be used. \n\nAlso, even should 1711047 be accepted, there is a further problem, detailed in the same\npatch, with the use of shutdown(): even if the File for a Conn is available via Dup or\nForkExec, the shutdown will blow the underlying connection away. \n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1.Try to user a Conn with ForkExec or Dup or Dup2\n\nI'm not sure the rest of these questions are relevant. It's a design issue not related\nto any particular version of Go. \n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
