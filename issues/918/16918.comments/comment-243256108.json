	"body": "gofmt doesn't usually change the contents of strings as it usually cannot know what they are used for (not semantics-preserving).\r\n\r\nOne might argue that this is different because gofmt knows that these are struct field tags and they follow a convention.\r\n\r\nHowever, note that it's only a convention. Neither the spec nor the compiler enforce this convention. Any program is free to use the tags as it pleases; and the spacing may matter. In general, gofmt cannot do the right thing here.\r\n\r\nOne could add an option, but we have refrained from adding options to gofmt (in fact, we have removed as many as we can). Furthermore, even with an option, one would need to know that only tag strings following the convention occur in a program. That's not obvious unless you wrote the code in the first place.\r\n\r\nI am against this proposal.",
