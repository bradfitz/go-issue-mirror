	"body": "For cleanup CLs like https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/8762, it would be nice if the trybots could take care of building a toolchain at HEAD, toolstash saving it, rebuilding at HEAD+CL, and then running an appropriate \"toolstash -cmp\" build.\r\n\r\nUsing toolstash/buildall, this only needs to be run once on a fast/cheap trybot type (e.g., linux/amd64) to avoid wasting more expensive trybot resources (e.g., OS X and/or ARM).\r\n\r\nObviously this would only be on an opt-in basis.  Perhaps just a new dedicated trybot type that doesn't run by default, is configured with a different testing script than running all.bash, and is selected via whatever +trybot mechanism is implemented.\r\n\r\nMaybe too niche a use case, but some rationale:\r\n  - Now that the toolchain is in Go, it seems like cleanup CLs to make the code more idiomatic are going to be increasingly common.\r\n  - It's easy to misuse toolstash; e.g., accidentally build the stashed toolchain at HEAD+CL rather than HEAD, negating the testing benefits.\r\n  - As a reviewer, you need to trust that developers who say \"Passes toolstash -cmp\" actually tested it correctly.",
