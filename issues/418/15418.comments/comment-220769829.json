In particular, this prohibits recursive read\r\nlocking. The restriction is due to fairness properties: to ensure that\r\nthe lock eventually becomes available, a blocked Lock call excludes new\r\nreaders from acquiring the lock.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would put such important notes on the type rather than on methods.\r\n",
