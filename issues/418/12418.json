	"body": "With freshly installed Android SDK, `gomobile install` doesn't work as expected and silently fails.\r\n\r\n1. Download Android SDK.\r\n2. Put the tools and platform tools to your PATH.\r\n3. Run the command below. It runs and exits with 0 whereas the the app is not installed on the device.\r\n```\r\n$ gomobile install  -target=android . # returns success prints out no\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you run adb, it prints out a notice to the stdout even though it returns 0 as its exit code.\r\n\r\n```\r\nadb\r\nIt appears you do not have 'Android SDK Platform-tools' installed.\r\nUse the 'android' tool to install them:\r\n    android update sdk --no-ui --filter 'platform-tools'\r\n```\r\n\r\n/cc @crawshaw @hyangah @nigeltao ",
