	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe nacl builder fails almost all subrepos.\n\nStop trying?\n\nWe at least need a --subrepos=false flag so we can run \u0026quot;make check\u0026quot; on the\nnacl Docker images and verify the nacl environment is correct. Right now it tries to\nbuild the subrepos and fails, so the Makefile would like to skip them.\n\nBut perhaps the builders as a whole should skip them.\u003c/pre\u003e",
