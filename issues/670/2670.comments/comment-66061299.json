I would avoid looking at the implementation\nand focus purely on correctness of the comparison. You can always scan backwards.\n\nAnyway, In your example above\n\n\"Z\" has a meaning in a specific encoding. \\x00 has no meaning at the end of a string and\nshould be ignored or am I missing something fundamental in my understand of strings and\nencodings. \n\nIn that sense I would argue \"hello\\x00\" and \"hello\" are the same in any encoding and\nshould be treated as being the same.\u003c/pre\u003e",
