It is only when the generated wrapper is  **shared** by unrelated assignments that the -fm entries become problematic. Consider:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1:    f2 := a.PrintSomething\r\n2:    f2(\"a\")\r\n3:    f3 := a.PrintSomething\r\n4:    f3(\"b\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf f3(\"b\") panics in this situation, I would expect it to report an -fm entry on line 3. Instead, it will report an -fm from line 2. Demo: https://play.golang.org/p/QT5pkBEqSS\r\n\r\nThis is particularly confusing if f2 and f3 reside in separate files / packages. You end up analyzing a stack that has an effectively random file \u0026 line for the -fm entry. \r\n",
