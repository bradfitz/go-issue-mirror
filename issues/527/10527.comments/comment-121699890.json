	"body": "My particular case is on passive sockets and I think that's certainly where this behavior is more likely to be seen, but it seems like ideally it would apply to passive and active sockets. If Close() is called on a socket it should invoke close on the underlying file descriptor before returning. I wold also expect that shutdown is called before CloseRead() or CloseWrite() return on a TCPConn. Is there a reason to only implement it for passive sockets?",
