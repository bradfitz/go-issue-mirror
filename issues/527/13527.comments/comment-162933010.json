	"body": "Interestingly, this turns out to be a great example of when traditional sampling profiling does not correlate with end-to-end performance. As a workaround, I disabled the background sweeper so I can debug my original issue, but even though this reduces the number of futex sleeps/wakeups by ~250X in BinaryTree17, it has almost no effect on the benchmark's performance! Of course, this makes sense, because this only consumes time on otherwise idle Ms.\r\n\r\nThis workaround did, however, demonstrate other reasons it's important to fix this. It reduced the total CPU time of the benchmark by 10% (and presumably had a similar, if not more pronounced effect on power). It also significantly reduced the noise in profiles. Without the workaround, this noise masked the issue I was actually trying to debug to the point where every one of a dozen different hardware counters indicated the benchmark should have been faster when it was in fact slower. With the workaround in place, the counters paint a very clear picture.",
