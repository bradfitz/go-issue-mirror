It means that whatever SEH handlers are registered,\nplus SEH dispatcher in Windows itself, need stack space to work. If go is not careful\nWindows would just happily overwrite heap headers or worse.\n\nThe attached patch makes StackSystem part of StackGuard, so that there's less chance of\nproblems in the future.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1779/5/go-win-stack.diff\"\u003ego-win-stack.diff\u003c/a\u003e (4059 bytes)",
