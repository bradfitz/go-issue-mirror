Go violates SEH\ncalling convention by not saving ebx, esi and edi registers. It just so happens that on\nWindows 2000 ntdll.dll uses esi for CONTEXT* pointer and morestack/lessstack are\ndestroying esi, so when it returns from go handler it tries to check context flags and\nrecursively crashes until go runs out of stack.\n\nPlease test this patch on Win2k (I only tested it on WinXP, since I don't have Win2k at\nhome), and if it works I'll submit it to code review.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1779/18/go-seh-fix.patch\"\u003ego-seh-fix.patch\u003c/a\u003e (1099 bytes)",
