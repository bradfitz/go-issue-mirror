It seems to me that checks\nshould of stackguard should also substract StackSystem in addition to StackGuard. There\nare a couple of such places in proc.c.\n\nAlso, while looking at the source code of 8l, I find it strange how it redefines\nStackSmall and StackBig. First, it seems to me that StackBig should really be 4096+2048,\nsince StackSystem on windows is 2048, and why is StackBig 256? While these sure don't\nhurt, it seems to me it would cause splits earlier than they should be, wasting more\nstack.\n\nI'll try compiling go on windows tomorrow with these changes and will see how it goes...\u003c/pre\u003e",
