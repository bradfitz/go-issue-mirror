We used to do this\nfor individual releases and it was too heavy weight.\n\nThe official suggestion for maintaining code that needs to work with multiple Go 1.x\nversions is either to limit yourself to the features of the oldest supported version or\nto use // +build tags in files. It is a significantly lighter weight mechanism than\ndifferent versions or branches.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **go2**, removed **priority-triage**._",
