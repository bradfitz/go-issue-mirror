If you convert that into the single string that it could be, it compiles in a few seconds.  It's machine-generated code, I recommend fixing the machine-generator.  It's also possible that judicious use of parentheses could get past this, along the lines of:\r\n```\r\n(\"a0\"+\"a1\"+\"a2\"+...+\"a2,999\")+(\"a3,000\"+\"a3,001\"+\"a3,002\"+...+\"a5,999\")+...+\r\n(\"a2,997,000\"+...+\"a2,999,999\")+\"a3,000,000\"\r\n```",
