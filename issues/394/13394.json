I don't know if it is a bug or not, but I have a curious situation:\r\n\r\n* \u003cb\u003eSituation works\u003c/b\u003e: \r\nI have a script in Go that exec a phantomjs, but this script is called by a php program.\r\nmy index.php there is `system(\"./screenshot $arg1 $arg2 $arg3 $arg4\"); `, in my screenshot.go there is `cmd := exec.Command(\"screen.js\", arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)` and in the first line screen.js  there is `#!/usr/bin/env phantomjs` \r\n \r\n* \u003cb\u003eSituation doesn't work\u003c/b\u003e: \r\nNow my script Go is a service using the lib \"github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter\". So my php just send a JSON for this service. in my script go exec the same command `cmd := exec.Command(\"screen.js\", arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)` and the screen.js continues the same `#!/usr/bin/env phantomjs`. However, this way doesn't work. The message error is \"exit status 127\". \r\n\r\nThen to fix it I just changed the command `cmd := exec.Command(\"/usr/bin/phantomjs\", \"screen.js\", arg1, arg2, arg3, arg3)`\r\n\r\nI don't know if it happens with other bin or if it is just in my case, or if it a bug or not in how the Go executes the process by shebang or not. I just would like to know if someone has a explanation for it.\r\n\r\nMy phantomjs bin is in /usr/bin/ version 2.0.1-development\r\nGo version is go version go1.5.1 linux/amd64  - Kubuntu 14.04\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",
