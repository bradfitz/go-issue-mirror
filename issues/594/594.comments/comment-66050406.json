This needn't break backward compatibility other than very\nminorly, e.g.:\n\nvar buf []byte\nvar ok os.Error\nbuf, ok = make([]byte, ...) // return with ok != nil on failure\nbuf = make([]byte, ...)     // runtime error as currently implemented\n\nProviding the make() is presumed to provide two values any time it is used in tuple\nassignment, existing code like the following would at least get an \"assignment count\nmismatch\" compile time error:\n\nvar buf []byte\nvar s string\nbuf, s = make([]byte, ...), \"fubar\"\n\nfile.go: assignment count mismatch: 3 = 2\n\nOr maybe it's not too late an incompatible change; the language still seems at least\nsomewhat in flux.\u003c/pre\u003e",
