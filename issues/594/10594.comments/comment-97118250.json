Re-opening.\r\n\r\nIf we're repainting sheds, we could reduce the noise levels while we're at it and remove those pesky inconsistent colons:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n=== RUN   TestGroupContextListings\r\n    PASS  TestGroupContextListings (0.00s)\r\n=== RUN   TestIdentifyCompletedTasks\r\n    FAIL  TestIdentifyCompletedTasks (0.00s)\r\n=== RUN   TestIdentifyStalledProjects\r\n    PASS  TestIdentifyStalledProjects (0.00s)\r\n=== RUN   TestIdentifyFinishedProjects\r\n    PASS  TestIdentifyFinishedProjects (0.00s)\r\nFAIL\r\n```\r\n\r\nI thought briefly that the hyphens might be to help keep things roughly aligned for those using variable-width fonts, but hyphens have different width than equal signs anyway. If we want that, an en dash will be much closer:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n=== RUN   TestGroupContextListings\r\n––– PASS  TestGroupContextListings (0.00s)\r\n=== RUN   TestIdentifyCompletedTasks\r\n––– FAIL  TestIdentifyCompletedTasks (0.00s)\r\n=== RUN   TestIdentifyStalledProjects\r\n––– PASS  TestIdentifyStalledProjects (0.00s)\r\n=== RUN   TestIdentifyFinishedProjects\r\n––– PASS  TestIdentifyFinishedProjects (0.00s)\r\nFAIL\r\n```",
