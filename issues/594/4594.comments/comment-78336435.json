The one-liner `int(f+0.5)` only works for positive values, which I assume is one reason JavaScript provides the [`Math.round()`][mdn] method to properly round numbers to the nearest integer. \r\n\r\nI'd like to see this issue reconsidered, but in the meantime I'll use the following function. I'm only a new gopher, so I respect the core contributors' decision. But for those of us coming from Python, JavaScript, or Ruby, this may be a tripping hazard, albeit a small one.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc Round(val float64) int {\r\n\tif val \u003c 0 {\r\n\t\treturn int(val-0.5)\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn int(val+0.5)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor those gophers wanting to round a float64 to a float64 with a given precision, here are two gists:\r\n\r\n- https://gist.github.com/indytechcook/5706434\r\n- https://gist.github.com/DavidVaini/10308388\r\n\r\n[mdn]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round",
