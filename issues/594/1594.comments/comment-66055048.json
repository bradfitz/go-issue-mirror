One or both might be\nuseful.\n\nThe tests don't compile because they depend on another of our internal packages, but\nhopefully it gives some good API ideas.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1594/4/time.tar.gz\"\u003etime.tar.gz\u003c/a\u003e (6379 bytes)",
