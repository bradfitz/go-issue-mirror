The fix for the Writer is more involved.\r\n\r\nThe current logic for the Writer is to the assume that it is writing in one format, and then it tries to backtrack if it can't use that format and switch to another. However, it's complicated trying to keep track of what state needs to be undone and what writes have already occurred (or not). A better approach is to verify up-front what formats can be used for the given input file and commit to using that format. There should be no back-tracking.",
