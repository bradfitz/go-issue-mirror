The API documented in os/exec doesn't talk about the fact that it's one use, and the cause of errors seem implementation-specific.\r\n\r\nCalling a function multiple times safely is the assumed behaviour of most APIs - I wouldn't expect documentation to clarify that it's safe to call fmt.Println multiple times.\r\n\r\nIf it helps, try to imagine if you were implementing an alternative implementation of the os/exec module. Would it be clear to you (without looking at the code) whether or not Run should be reusable?",
