	"body": "Especially for fast builders, I suggest that we make then use the keepgoing\r\nmode of `go tool dist test` so that even if a test fails, all the remaining tests\r\nare still tested.\r\n\r\nThis will be especially useful if a flaky tests fails and then masks the real\r\nproblem of a given a CL because the affected tests are not run.\r\n\r\nAs an example, https://golang.org/cl/19455 changes the runtime, but\r\nthe openbsd builder fails a unrelated net tests, and the runtime tests are\r\nnot run so we don't actually know if the CL catches any problems on\r\nOpenBSD/386.\r\nhttp://build.golang.org/log/38e92c1c987f7a7eeb4b6bb418c0d95ed706ba80\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's worthwhile to also use the -k for the trybots. I can see\r\narguments from both sides.\r\n\r\n/cc @bradfitz @adg ",
