The builder coordinator has its own logic for test sharding and when to stop.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how useful this would be in practice. Usually the first failure is enough and the rest would be noise.\r\n\r\nI also want to read errors quickly from the builders and not waste more time finding more errors (especially if they'll be useless).\r\n\r\nBut as long as it can be done without slowing things done, I'm not opposed to this.\r\n\r\nI don't have the time to work on this at the moment, though.\r\n",
