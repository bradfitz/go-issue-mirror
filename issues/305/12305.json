	"body": "Commit [12c48ced (cmd/gotype: use std lib go/types instead of x/tools version)](https://go.googlesource.com/tools/+/12c48ced94a7752f71687ef145a83a59e9a6f846) to the \"gotype\" tool prevents the tool from being built on versions of go prior to 1.5. For instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.4.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xz\r\n$ export GOROOT=$HOME/go\r\n$ export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin\r\n$ export GOPATH=$HOME/gopath\r\n$ go version\r\ngo version go1.4.2 linux/amd64\r\n$ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gotype\r\npackage golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gotype\r\n\timports go/importer: unrecognized import path \"go/importer\"\r\npackage golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gotype\r\n\timports go/types: unrecognized import path \"go/types\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust going by the commit, it would appear that the future of \"gotype\" is to use packages that have recently been included in Go's standard library.  Is this an intentional deprecation of the command for older versions?\r\n\r\ncc: @griesemer",
