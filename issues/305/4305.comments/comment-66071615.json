Replacing the operating system with arch linux has\nproduced a builder which has performed flawlessly in soak tests and proven to be a very\nstable builder. \n\nThe remaining question is what in the Ubunut linux + pandaboard combination causes the\nstrange segfaults. For the moment I will add a note to the builder page that ubuntu\n11.10/12.04 OMAP4 kernels are not recommended as builders.\u003c/pre\u003e",
