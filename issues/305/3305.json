Much prettier. What's the downside?\u0026quot;\n\nRuss: \u0026quot;I have used systems with 'mostly sorted' lists before, and the convenience\nalways seems to give way to confusion, because people think they _are_ sorted and then\ncan't find things.\u0026quot;\n\nRobert: \u0026quot;Can we have different modes for looking at it?\u0026quot;\n\nBrad: \u0026quot;The default is all that matters. There's already a flat mode (which I\nprefer), but I can never remember how to get to it without looking up the source, which\nI'm always too lazy to do. You could argue for mode-switching links, but therein lies\ncraziness.\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e",
