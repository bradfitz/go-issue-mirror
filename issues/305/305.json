Even if the function has the\nsame signature in each interface the intended functionality might be\ndifferent. At worst the signatures might be different and so implementing\nboth would be impossible.\n\nA mechanism that declared an implementation through a map of interface\nnames to implementation names would seem to work.\u003c/pre\u003e",
