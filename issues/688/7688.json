	"body": "\u003cpre\u003e---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Rob 'Commander' Pike\n\nOne feature request that would help significantly: please put (even very simple) axes on\nthe graphs.  If I look at a chart like this:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://goperfd.appspot.com/perfgraph?builder=linux-amd64\u0026amp\"\u003ehttp://goperfd.appspot.com/perfgraph?builder=linux-amd64\u0026amp\u003c/a\u003e;benchmark=json\u0026amp;procs=1\u0026amp;metric=time\u0026amp;startcommit=2256\u0026amp;commitnum=200\u0026amp;zoomout=Zoom+out\n\nit's unclear what is going on.  I can hover over kinks in the line but it would help a\nlot to have even, say, the minimum and maximum values on the x and y axes labeled, in\nthis case the relative percentage change (what do the horizontal lines mean?) and\nsomething like the date or CL# or rev# for the first and last changes on the x axis.\n\nRuss also suggests looking at how the graphs at go/gousage work to see if we can make\nthat nice navigation UI work, but that is a bigger job.\n\nFor now, I'd be happy just to have the three corners (UL, LL, LR) labeled.\n\nThanks.\n\n-rob\u003c/pre\u003e",
