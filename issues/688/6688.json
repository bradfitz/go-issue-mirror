Dying.\n\n\nThere is a limit on amount of simultaneously alive goroutines.\nWe need to print a more informative message, add a link to a web page saying what to do\nin this case.\nProbably remove \u0026quot;ThreadSanitizer\u0026quot; since the race detector is not branded as\nThreadSanitizer.\nLook into increasing this limit to say 16K.\u003c/pre\u003e",
