Suggestions welcome.\n\nHowever, it would be great if the xml package was consistent with elements and\nattributes, for example:\nroot\u0026gt;data\u0026gt;value works for\n\u0026lt;root\u0026gt;\u0026lt;data\u0026gt;\u0026lt;value\u0026gt;tada\u0026lt;/value\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/data\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/root\u0026gt;\nroot\u0026gt;data\u0026gt;value,attr should imho work for \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;\u0026lt;data\nvalue=\"tada\"/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/root\u0026gt;\n\nIt would mean you wouldn't need to create struct stepping stones to the attribute.\u003c/pre\u003e",
