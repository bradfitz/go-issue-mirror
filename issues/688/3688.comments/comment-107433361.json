Currently this is not as straightforward as it should be:\r\n\r\n`Members    []int    'xml:\"members\u003emember,id,attr\"'`\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n\u003cmembers\u003e\r\n    \u003cmember id=\"1\"/\u003e\r\n    \u003cmember id=\"2\"/\u003e\r\n\u003c/members\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is basically going to target the id attribute inside the member elements.\r\n\r\n**Error: \"members\u003emember chain not valid with id attr flag\"**\r\n\r\nI also tried it this way, although I'd think the first was more logically \"correct\" `members\u003emember\u003eid,attr`\r\n\r\n**Error: \"id chain not valid with attr flag\"**\r\n\r\nI was hoping in the 2nd attempt, that Go would automagically check for attributes if no child elements matched.\r\n\r\nI might look into a fix, if noone else is working on this.",
