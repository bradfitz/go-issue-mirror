Note however, that the == comparison should show true if you add\n\u0026lt;/getBookings\u0026gt; to the raw input properly.\n\nShould the xml package handle your original input?  My current thinking is: yes.  But if\nit will not or can not, then that behavior needs to be somehow documented at least.\n\nThe source for the xml package is a bit daunting.  To me anyway.  In particular note the\none big BUG comment by rsc in read.go. That makes it very unclear to me what the go team\nis thinking in regards to the package as a whole.\n\nGood luck with this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
