However .....\n\nAfter thinking / reading more I am not convinced that what you are seeing is totally\nincorrect.\n\nThe godoc for the xml packages says (in several different places):\n\n\u0026lt;godoc\u0026gt;\na non-pointer anonymous struct field is handled as if the\nfields of its value were part of the outer struct.\n\u0026lt;/godoc\u0026gt;\n\nI now think that has something to do with what you are seeing.\n\nI originally thought this was a problem with Unmarshal, and if that could be corrected\nthen Marshal would behave as might be expected.  That was incorrect.  Consider:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/4PCdcVY8Az\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/4PCdcVY8Az\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThat begs the question of why the Unmarshalled attribute values in your original example\nappear to be incorrect.\u003c/pre\u003e",
