The problem is \nthat the main function splits the stack, and then calls into the dynamic linker.  I \nthink the only way this will work is to use a new version of gold as the linker.  I \nwill test that.  It may also be possible to use a more accurate estimate of the size \nof the initial stack to avoid splitting the stack of main.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
