	"body": "crypto/x509/root_linux.go defines some standard certificate bundles locations, but root_unix.go defines only one single certificate directory. This should be consistent with OpenSSL design of system certificates:\r\n- read certificate bundle from OPENSSL_DIR/certs.pem\r\n- read all certificates from OPENSSL_DIR/certs directory\r\n\r\nCurrently #1 is fulfilled with root_linux.go, but #2 is missing; so e.g. on Fedora/RHEL /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt is read, but directory /etc/pki/tls/certs is not searched.",
