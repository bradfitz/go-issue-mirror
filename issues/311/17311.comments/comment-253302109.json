	"body": "@RLH and I chatted about whether to guarantee that SetFinalizer won't panic if passed a package-level variable. Neither of us have strong feelings about this either way, but the existing non-guarantee is more permissive for the implementation of finalizers and lets us change our minds later if there's more evidence. Further, it's important in general that SetFinalizer only be called for the beginning of an object, but we can't check that for package-level data, so we're leaning towards not trying to make any guarantees about pointers to package-level variables.\r\n\r\nHence, we're going to leave the documentation alone unless there's more compelling evidence for specifying this than the documentation being more restrictive than the implementation.",
