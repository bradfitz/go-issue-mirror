Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Observe initial CPU utilization\n2. run godoc -http=:6060\n3. Observe System CPU utilization \n\nWhat is the expected output?\nI'd expect to see slight cpu utilization to run the process, perhaps higher on startup. \n\nWhat do you see instead?\nI see sustained System cpu utilization in the 80% range even while no requests are being\nhandled. \n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nOpenBSD amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n2594f4a8314e+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI ran a ktrace on this and found gettimeofday() being called tens of thousands of times\na second. This seems similar to the issue that ruby had a while ago.\u003c/pre\u003e",
