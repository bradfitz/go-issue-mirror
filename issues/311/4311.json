	"body": "by **ibexris**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eOn OSX with go 1.0.3.\n\nI've cloned a github project (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bmizerany/noeqd)\"\u003ehttps://github.com/bmizerany/noeqd)\u003c/a\u003e into a random temp\ndirectory, rather than my main code directory.  If I attempt to \u0026quot;go install\u0026quot;\nthe package (which contains only a binary output, no package/include files), it builds\nthe noeqd program but fails to install it (this may be related to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/3652\"\u003eissue #3652\u003c/a\u003e).\n\nI would expect it either tries to install in the main GOROOT path (in OSX, this is\nroot-writable /usr/local/go/), or at least throw the \u0026quot;no install location\u0026quot;\nerror that is thrown when trying to build library-only packages.\n\nInstalling to the main path would be preferable to me, but I suspect the latter would be\nmore go-like.  However, because setting GOPATH to the same as GOROOT is a no-op, there\nis no way to force a package to install in the main source tree.\n\nFWIW, if I use sudo and set GOBIN=`go env GOROOT`/bin the noeqd binary installs just\nfine at /usr/local/go/bin/.\u003c/pre\u003e",
