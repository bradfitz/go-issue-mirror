	"body": "To avoid spurious allocations, `sync.Pool` should always be used with pointers. For instance, when storing buffers as slices, a pointer to slice should be used instead of the slice itself. This was brought up  in http://golang.org/cl/24371 by @dvyukov.\r\n\r\nSince the primary goal of `sync.Pool` is to reduce allocations, I think it might be worth adding a check to `go vet` about this. The check could be triggered on `Put()` calls in which the argument is not a pointer.",
