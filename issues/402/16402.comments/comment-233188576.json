It contains a lot of unit test code (and using the old goimports test style, which has a lot of boilerplate) and this:\r\n\r\n\u003e What did you expect to see?\r\n\u003e The package imported correctly.\r\n\r\nWhat is \"correctly\"?\r\n\r\n\u003e What did you see instead?\r\n\u003e No imports were written.\r\n\r\nWell, your `What did you do?` answer was a unit test, so for `What did you see instead?` I'd expect to see the failure output of your unit test so I can see which error you're reporting.\r\n\r\nCan you just explain it without code, or update the code to use `testConfig` instead, and show the test failure output?\r\n",
