So far\nI've been unable to reproduce it on my other laptop. I'll let it run over night and see\nwhat happens.\n\nOn this computer however I can reproduce this easily. I tried to remove go and do a\nfresh hg clone and ./all.bash, but it still segfaults.\n\nSome info:\n[~/go]$ free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          3841       2821       1019          0        152       1603\n-/+ buffers/cache:       1065       2775\nSwap:            0          0          0\n\n[~/go]$ uname -a\nLinux x220 3.6.6-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Nov 5 11:57:22 CET 2012 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n[~/go]$ gofmt -l src/pkg\nsrc/pkg/exp/locale/collate/colelem.go\nSegmentation fault\n\nAnything else that could help with the trouble shooting?\n\nThe laptop on which this behavior is reproducible is a Lenovo x220. I tried the same\nthing on a Lenovo x61s, but it only fails on the x220.\u003c/pre\u003e",
