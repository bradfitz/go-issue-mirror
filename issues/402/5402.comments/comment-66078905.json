And most of allocated memory consist\nof runtimeÂ·mheap (about 270MB) and \"page table\" (about 270MB). \"Page table\" is not\nmapped into process virtual space, but it seems to be counted against process\n\"committed\" memory. It is appears in process memory map as we \"reserve\" 128GB allocation\narena. From what I can gather, it is OS overhead of our reservation - perhaps some\ntables that are used to translate process addresses into physical memory. The overhead\nis present on 386 too, but, since reservation is much smaller, it is not as noticeable.\n\nEven if we could avoid \"page table\" altogether, remaining 270MB is still too much for\naverage windows program.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
