It shows people who are using ListenAndServeTLS for the\nfirst time how to use flag, crypto/tls and time, and how to do a little file\nmanipulation.\n\nIf this is removed, or if it won't be supported, may I suggest that the documentation\nfor net/http.ListenAndServeTLS is changed from:\n\n\"One can use generate_cert.go in crypto/tls to generate cert.pem and key.pem.\"\n\nto something like: \n\n\"One can generate cert.pem and key.pem using OpenSSL:\n\n# openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048\n# openssl req -new -key key.pem -out req.csr\n# openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in req.csr -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem\n# rm -f req.csr\n\"\n\nNobody remembers these commands, and leaving it and generate_cert out of the docs create\nan unnecessary obstacle. (The downside, of course, is that e.g. Windows users have no\neasy/out-of-the-box way to set up a Go SSL server.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
