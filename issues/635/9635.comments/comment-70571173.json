One extra level\nof indirection won't hurt much as the overhead of cgocall is much higher.\n3. Dot import syscall in internal/syscall. This might be ugly, but it is\nprobably fine in this case as we are extending existing syscall package and\nit will also prevent us from redefining existing symbols in the original\nsyscall package.\n\nI like the 3rd option best.",
