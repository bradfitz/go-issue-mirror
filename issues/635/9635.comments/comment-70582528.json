And the first three common\npackages happen to all import them in the same file. Renaming a package is\nnot as rare as you might have expected.\n\nhttps://camlistore.googlesource.com/camlistore.git/+/master/website/camweb.go\nhttps://github.com/bosun-monitor/bosun/blob/master/cmd/bosun/conf/conf.go\nhttps://bitbucket.org/phlyingpenguin/collectinator/src/default/common/http.go\n\nSimilar name collision happen with net/http/pprof and runtime/pprof,\ngo/scanner and text/scanner, crypto/rand and math/rand. That's the example\nin the std packages.\n\nIf you don't want renaming syscall package, you can only use it in a new\nfile, as long as we design internal/syscall in a way that the user are not\nrequired to also import syscall, that should be fine too.",
