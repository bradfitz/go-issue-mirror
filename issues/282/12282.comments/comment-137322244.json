Go is supposed to be about scalable software development practices, and copy+paste+edit is not one of them. This scenario sounds like code that should be factored into packages more properly. It doesn't sound like a compelling enough use case to warrant additional complexity in the go command.\r\n\r\nThat said, there is already a mechanism for relative import paths roughly as you describe: the new vendor/ directory. It's arguably a misuse, but if you create project/vendor/user/acl then you can import just \"user/acl\" within project. I'd still encourage you to think about finding a way to share the code with packages instead of with cp.",
