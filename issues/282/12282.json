	"body": "I understand and agree with the merits of not allowing\r\nrelative import in general (libraries specially).\r\n\r\nYet still, there are times that a package is only ever\r\nused for a given project and now with `internal` support\r\nwith go tools, this assumption can _hard_  enforced.\r\n\r\nEnter cloning.\r\n\r\nI use Go everyday to build nimble micro-services that are\r\nvaguely similar but often have changing elements, having to\r\nrewrite the import paths every time I clone or fork a project\r\nis pretty tedious and error prone\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if packages under internal could be relatively\r\nimported.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\nfor packages under `$GOPATH/project` including itself, allow importing of\r\n`$GOPATH/project/internal/user` as `internal/user`\r\n`$GOPATH/project/internal/user/acl` as `internal/user/acl`.\r\n",
