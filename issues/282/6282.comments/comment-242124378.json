	"body": "@yiyus Thanks for your comments. I have spoken with several people at Google about this proposal, some of which work on machine-learning, and they expressed similar concerns. Personally, I also think that the 1d stride-1 restriction is too limiting.\r\n\r\nThe example I've brought up repeatedly (in the design doc) is that it makes perfect sense to want to extract a row and column vector from a matrix, and that both these vectors should be 1d vectors so that they can be supplied to a dot-product function that takes two 1d vectors.\r\n\r\n(At some point in the future one might want to supply more fancy \"slicing\" mechanisms, for instance one might want to select the diagonal of a matrix. If multi-dimensional slices/tables have strides in all directions, any such \"linear\" sub-section of a table can be represented w/o having to change the internal representation.)\r\n\r\nI think the good news is that the proposal clarified these two implementations aspects (generalized slices that degrade into regular Go slices but have a restriction, and a more general multi-dimensional data structure \"table\" as this was the original name).\r\n\r\nI'm going to review the latest draft update for the current version in the next few days and at that point it might be good to determine the next steps forward; e.g., should one explore an unrestricted proposal in detail.\r\n",
