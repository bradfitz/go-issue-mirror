I just want to show how I think that everything essential to implement multidimensional slices in what I consider a useful form is a new type, a reshape operation and multi-dimensional slicing/indexing.\r\n\r\nPlease, if you have any specific comment, add them directly in the document, to avoid hijacking this issue.",
