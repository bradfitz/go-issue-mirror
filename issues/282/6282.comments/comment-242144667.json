	"body": "@btracey Answering your question, since Fortran 90 it is possible to take rows from a matrix with a similar syntax as the one used by Python, as for example in: `row = matrix(1,:)`. Fortran uses column major ordering, so `col = matrix(:,1)` would just be a sub-array of stride 1 (every array has a stride in Fortran).\r\n\r\nAlso, I do not think that supporting strided slices would suppose a problem for optimization, on the contrary. If they are not supported, some workaround will be needed to extract columns from a matrix, but this will disallow applying optimizations with SIMD instructions that support strided loads.",
