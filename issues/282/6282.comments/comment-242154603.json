But, often it is not difficult to support general-purpose striding. I encourage you to use the striding information in your own code whenever possible, and reserve single-segment requirements for wrapping third-party code. Using the striding information provided with the ndarray rather than requiring a contiguous striding reduces copying that otherwise must be made.\"",
