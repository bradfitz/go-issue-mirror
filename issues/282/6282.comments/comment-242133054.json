(I suppose you may have facilities to tap into their brains :P)\r\n\r\nbefore Go, I was into C++ and (C)python. There, `numpy` is king and builds on top of the [\"buffer protocol\"](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html) to provide data interop' (between `C`-land and `CPython`, but also between various `CPython` extension modules, _e.g._ a `SQL` module and `numpy`, `numpy` and `PIL`/`pillow` (python image libraries)) and cheap slice'n'dice operations.\r\n\r\nhaving a ndim-slice like the buffer protocol (so, with strides), without any allocation possible (so w/o `cap`) but with `reshape` would fit the bill in image processing, ML, high energy physics and, probably, all science-y data crunching applications.\r\n\r\nhaving said that, between having this proposal implemented and the current status quo, I would go with this proposal (even if to somehow repeat the mistakes of the `std::valarray\u003cT\u003e` from `C++`).",
