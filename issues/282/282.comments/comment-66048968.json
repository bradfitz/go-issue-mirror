If we\nhad something in place for supporting this, it may be something fixable, but I'm not\nintimately familiar with clone(2) on Linux -- so hopefully fewer args doesn't mean\nincompatible implementation.\n\nDo you have a link to a 2.4 manpage for the syscall? (Are futexes available in 2.4?)\n\n--dho\u003c/pre\u003e",
