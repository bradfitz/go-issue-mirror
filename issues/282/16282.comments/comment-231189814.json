	"body": "thanks for getting back. The above said example was a very basic one which didn't capture the issue I reported at first. Just posting a snippet from my earlier comment,\r\n\r\n\\u0018\\u0004 \\u0000\\u0098\\u0004\\u0000\\u00A8 this string when we UnMarshal should ideally have been resolved to this \\x18\\x04 \\x00\\x98\\x04\\x00\\xa8, instead it converts partially to \\x18\\x04 \\x00\\u0098\\x04\\x00Â¨ where anything lesser than u\\\\0080 is converted to the corresponding hex but anything higher than that is preserved as is (u\\\\0098 is preserved in the final output, ideally should have been \\x98). I am thinking the unmarshalling library is only detecting 2 bytes to be converted to hex and leaves anything bigger to as is.\r\n\r\nSorry, to reproduce this, I am not sure what I can provide to you apart from these details.",
