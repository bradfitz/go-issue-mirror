Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n1. Try to build go on linux kernel \u0026lt; 2.5.49. The first test that needs to \nfork a process will fail in newoproc function from thread.c\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux/386  (linux 2.4.21)\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nd25a47920411+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI did some initial investigation and it seems that the clone system call \nused to have fewer arguments in before 2.5.49.\n\nThe assembly code in src/pkg/runtime/linux/386/sys.s probably does not work \nwith the older version of clone.\u003c/pre\u003e",
