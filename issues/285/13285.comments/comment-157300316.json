Thanks for the comment, I'll write a new func.\r\n\r\nin my defense if you swap the for loops, so idxs are the outer loop, the result is still wrong. (I think, I will check)\r\n\r\nedit: @minux is right. whats the solution?\r\n\r\nedit: I think my method of writing that was obviously wrong, maybe the solution is to make a function `moveIdxFront(s []int, idx int)`, and then use that:  `for _,v := range Idxs { a = moveIdxFront(a, v) }`",
