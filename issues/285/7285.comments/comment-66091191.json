That is because the tests are often\nin the same package as the code being tested, so they can access internal functions. \nThus the code must be recompiled.\n\nYour solution seems like the best one for your use case.\n\nWe could modify \"go test\" so that if the tests use a different package name, and the\nsources are installed and up to date, it does not rebuild the sources.  I don't know\nwhether that would be a good idea or not.\u003c/pre\u003e",
