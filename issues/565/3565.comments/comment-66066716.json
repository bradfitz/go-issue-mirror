This seems like a bad idea in general. So a correct fix would need to add to\nthe API of compress/lzw a boolean for \"tolerate errors?\".\n\nAn API change to compress/lzw before Go 1.1 is not going to happen, so I think punting\non this is the right call.\n\nThe image in comment #7 is something else (\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/5050\"\u003eissue #5050\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/pre\u003e",
