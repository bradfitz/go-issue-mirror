	"body": "The text you mention all seems to me to be about the way %s and %v handle spaces in input, which is fine. It does not seem to say anything about the meaning of a space in the format pattern. What I do see is:\r\n\r\n\u003e When scanning with Scanf, Fscanf, and Sscanf, all non-empty runs of space characters (except newline) are equivalent to a single space in both the format and the input. With that proviso, text in the format string must match the input text; scanning stops if it does not, with the return value of the function indicating the number of arguments scanned.\r\n\r\nBut that would suggest that \" \" in the format pattern should _not_ match \"\" in the input. Yet it does.\r\n\r\nP.S. The Scanf doc comment seems like it should drop \"space-separated\": scanning \"%d,%d\" against \"1,2\" doesn't have anything to do with spaces.\r\n",
