	"body": "I did a bit of playing around this morning and was able to come up with a function `net.RegisterSockaddr` which enables registering an address family, a `net.Addr`, a `syscall.Sockaddr`, and converter functions between the two.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that package `syscall` is frozen, but I was able to make this work by only modifying the `net` package anyway.\r\n\r\nI was able to use it to successfully send ARP requests using a modified copy of my https://github.com/mdlayher/raw package which registers link-layer sockets using this mechanism.\r\n\r\nI'd like to send a proposal later today, and if the idea is sound, clean it up, test it, and submit changelists to try to make this work.  If this is able to go in, I'd be able to contribute `x/net/linklayer` or similar for raw ethernet sockets.\r\n\r\nAny further thoughts, @rsc and/or @mikioh ?",
