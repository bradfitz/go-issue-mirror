That is a\nbug.\n\nRegarding bad UTF-8, it's much less clear. Badly encoded UTF-8 is not a \"control\ncharacter\". On the other hand, if the UTF-8 is bad, the string cannot be \"represented\nunchanged\" in some sense.\n\nI will address the 7F issue and open a new issue for bad UTF-8, which is a larger topic\nless clear cut.
