You are trying to infer types through a generic sort.Sort funnel, so without making a copy of sort.Sort for each callsite you're out of luck.\r\nEven if you could solve that somehow, there is still the requirement of associating the length of these various slices with each other so we know the accesses are in bounds.  That is also a hard problem.",
