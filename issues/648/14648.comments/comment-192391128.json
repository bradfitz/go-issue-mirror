I'm no expert in the field, but my understanding is that the new algorithm is quite efficient. Not sure we can get a lot out of this.\r\n\r\nI was a bit surprised by the change. Suffix arrays are great when computation is done essentially once (because it tends to be slow) but lookups must be fast (fast binary search over vast quantity of data). That's not really the case here, is it?",
