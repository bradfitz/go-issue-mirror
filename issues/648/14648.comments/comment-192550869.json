So as expected, it looks like a better fit than the standard library's suffixarray package.\r\n\r\nUp to you want you want to do. We can wait until you port divsufsort and try that (I expect it's a little better for the job, string data seems to cap out at a few megabytes in binaries I've looked at, so memory use is not a concern compared to the other things the linker does).\r\n\r\nOr you could send a CL importing it as cmd/link/internal/sais, and we can hook it up now.\r\n\r\nOr more radically you can propose it be added as an option to index/suffixarray. I tend to stay out of stdlib additions so I'm not going to weigh in on that.",
