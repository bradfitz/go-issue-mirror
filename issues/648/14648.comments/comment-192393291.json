Brad's point here is that 50% of the time spent in the benchmarks is in this function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc (x *suffixSortable) Less(i, j int) bool {\r\n        return x.inv[x.sa[i]+x.h] \u003c x.inv[x.sa[j]+x.h]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...which is probably doing more bounds checking than necessary and maybe SSA can help.",
