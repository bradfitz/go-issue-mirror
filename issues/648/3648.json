	"body": "by **kballard**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe godoc command will print whatever path you feed it as the import line in the\nresulting output. This is typically the desired behavior. However, when driven with the\ngo command (as in `go doc path`), the go cmd seems to resolve the path to an absolute\npath before passing it to godoc, which results in an import line that shows an absolute\npath. This is never desired.\n\n1. Run `godoc fmt`\n2. Run `go doc fmt`\n\nThe first command emits the correct output, including\n    import \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\n\nThe second command emits an absolute path for the import line, as in\n    import \u0026quot;/usr/local/go/src/pkg/fmt\u0026quot;\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nDarwin 12.0.0\n\nWhich version are you using?
