	"body": "@davecheney I think at some point people need to learn about packages. I don't think we should design our entire build process around the very first new user experience. Can you suggest a way of avoiding this conversation that doesn't throw out everything we already have? (My gut reaction is \"just tell them to put it in \"src/hello\" in the first place.\")\r\n\r\n@mdempsky I concur with @minux - I have no idea why you would care about resolving $GOPATH inside `pkg` or `bin`. I never change to those directories, ever. I also don't see the purpose in adding special files, when we already have a special directory (`src`).\r\n\r\nAnother consideration for this proposal is that it will theoretically break anyone that already has packages whose import paths have a `src` path component.\r\n\r\n",
