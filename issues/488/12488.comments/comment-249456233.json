	"body": "This proposal only changes the experience for newcomers who have not chosen to set a GOPATH variable.\r\n\r\nAt the moment all the documentation says \"you have to set a GOPATH\", then people get distracted and upset because they don't understand why they have to do this.\r\n\r\nBy choosing a default GOPATH, we can make our documentatation easier because we can say things like\r\n```\r\n$ go get github.com/foo/bar\r\n```\r\nwill check out the `github.com/foo/bar` repo into `$HOME/gocode/src/github.com/foo/bar`. \r\n\r\nWe don't need to distract newcomers with having to set an env var, all we need to do is put a little parenthetical note at the bottom of the page\r\n\r\n`$HOME/gocode` is the default path to your go workspace. If you want to change this path, set the `GOPATH` variable to something of your choosing.",
