	"body": "I'd like to suggest that any automatic strategy to compute GOPATH should work anywhere within $GOPATH, not just within $GOPATH/src.  E.g., it should at least also work within $GOPATH/bin and $GOPATH/pkg.\r\n\r\nEasy variation of the proposed scheme is instead of looking for a parent directory named \"src\" (and then using *its* parent as GOPATH), look for a parent directory with a \"src\" child directory (and use the parent itself as GOPATH).\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to add a new identifying file within the root directory.  E.g., Bazel uses an empty file named \"WORKSPACE\" (see [\"Getting Started with Bazel\"](http://bazel.io/docs/getting-started.html)) and Chromium's GN uses a file named \".gn\" with config settings (see [\"What you need for a minimal GN build\"](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/tools/gn/docs/standalone.md)).",
