Roll back to my proposal to see how that works.\r\n\r\nHere again straight from my memory:\r\n\r\n1. have a tool that looks if either $GOPATH is set or a .gopath hidden file indicates the $GOPATH\r\n2. if only .gopath is found, set $GOPATH globally to that\r\n2. if not, ask where to put it with a sensible default\r\n3. if an answer is given, put .gopath there so it will automatically work the next time, and set $GOPATH\r\n4. this tool should be run by go get etc if no gopath is set, just a simple invocation to check",
