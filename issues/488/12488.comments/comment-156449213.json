We can't reasonably rename pkg/ today.\r\nI agree that creating $HOME/pkg automatically is not ideal. \r\nBut $HOME/gopath seems clearly the wrong default too.\r\nThat seems to exclude a static default.\r\n\r\nThat still leaves the dynamic approach of walking up from the parent directory looking for a src/ element (or perhaps looking for a dir with a src/ subdir, so that the go command would work in the bin directory too). Thoughts there? @davecheney, you've offered somewhat balanced pros and cons for the automatic detection; overall do you think it is a good idea for GOPATH?\r\n",
