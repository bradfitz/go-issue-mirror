I thought it was going to be more along the lines of \"lets have a default GOPATH value (and it might be $HOME)\"\r\n\r\n\u003e mkdir -p src/github.com/user/hello\r\n\u003e cd src/github.com/user/hello\r\n\u003e vim hello.go\r\n\u003e go install\r\n\u003e hello\r\n\r\nI like this, but I think there are still a number of edge case that have to be explained en rote. \r\n\r\nq. why do I need to make a sub directory, can't go just work in my current directory ?\r\na. no, not really, Go works with packages, and packages are a directory\r\n\r\nq. oh, ok, well I put my code in src/hello.go and it didn't work !\r\na. ahh, well, src is special, you cannot put code directly in src/\r\n\r\nq. ok, so I put my code in gocode/hello.go and it didn't work, you told me src/ was special so I didn't use it\r\na. err, right, sorry, you need to use src/, but you can't put any code in that, try src/hello/hello.go\r\n\r\nq. ok, thanks for helping, that worked, but I have a question, why do I need all these directories, shouldn't Go be able to figure this out ?\r\na. _insert long technical explantation about package names being derived from import paths and how src/ would name no import path so technically not be importable into other package, not that that it matters 'cos its a main package_\r\n\r\nq. what's a package, i just wanted to try helloworld.go ?!?\r\n\r\nThis is taken pretty much verbatim from my experiences having to justify the $PROJECT/src directory in gb.
