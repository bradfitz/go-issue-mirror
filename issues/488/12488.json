	"body": "Setting up a workspace/GOPATH is one of the big hurdles for new Go users. And maintaining (switching between) several workspaces is a common work flow for some Go developers.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to make the GOPATH environment variable optional, and to have the go tool detect the GOPATH root on invocation. It would to this by walking up the tree from the cwd to find a directory named `src`, and setting `GOPATH` to the parent of that directory.\r\n\r\nFor new users, the getting started experience is something like:\r\n```\r\nmkdir -p src/github.com/user/hello\r\ncd src/github.com/user/hello\r\nvim hello.go\r\ngo install\r\nhello\r\n```\r\nor to install something else:\r\n```\r\nmkdir src\r\ncd src\r\ngo get github.com/docker/docker\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
