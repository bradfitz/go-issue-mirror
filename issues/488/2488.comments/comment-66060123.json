The spec seems pretty clear to me\n\n\"The iteration variables may be declared by the \"range\" clause (:=). In this case their\ntypes are set to the types of the respective iteration values and their scope ends at\nthe end of the \"for\" statement; they are re-used in each iteration.\"\n\nThe code should be equivalent to\n\nvar row [2]int\nfor n := range a {\n  row = a[n]\n  s[n] = row[:]\n}\n\nSo it is expected that at the end both s[0] and s[1] refer to the address of row, which\nis the same.\u003c/pre\u003e",
