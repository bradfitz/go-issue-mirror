Quoting:\r\n\r\n\u003e Normalization should not remove delimiters when their associated component is empty unless licensed to do so by the scheme specification. For example, the URI http://example.com/? cannot be assumed to be equivalent to any of the examples above.\r\n\r\nWhere \"examples above\" refers to:\r\n\r\n\u003e   http://example.com\r\n\u003e   http://example.com/\r\n\u003e   http://example.com:/\r\n    http://example.com:80/\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFYI, here is an example of API similar to the one in my issue above:\r\n\r\nhttps://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/ARK\r\n\u003e a brief metadata record if you append a single question mark to the ARK\r\n\u003e (...)\r\n\u003e Adding '??' to the end should return a policy statement.",
