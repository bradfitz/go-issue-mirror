This assumes that the packages have been built and installed more recently than their source code was edited.\r\n\r\nBecause this is assumption is often false, the golang.org/x/tools/go/loader package provides a means of loading all dependencies from source code as needed.  I recommend that you use that.\r\n\r\nThe stringer tool doesn't use go/loader; perhaps it should.",
