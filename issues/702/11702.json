	"body": "The fixed size of the internal buffer inside the Scanner type bothered some people when the API was proposed, but it was decided not to complicate the interface by providing a configuration.\r\n\r\nThe new io.CopyBuffer routine suggests a different model: Allow the user to provide a buffer, which not only gives control but also permits the user to manage/reuse memory when that is appropriate.\r\n\r\nMaybe do this for 1.6.\r\n",
