	"title": "x/sys/windows: Consider exporting kernel32 *LazyDLL",
	"body": "Currently all libraries needing more procedures load the libraries by hand using either syscall or x/sys/windows. The most common DLL by a large margin used in this fashion appears to be kernel32.dll.\r\n\r\nThis means that in larger applications there are half-a-dozen libraries loading kernel32.dll. They could use a shared copy since *LazyDLL is safe for concurrent use.\r\n\r\nExporting:\r\n```\r\nvar ModKernel32DLL = NewLazySystemDLL(\"kernel32.dll\")\r\n```\r\nfrom x/sys/windows would enable sharing this for applications.\r\n\r\nx/sys/windows loads a copy of kernel32.dll in any case (modkernel32).\r\n\r\nIf needed I can write a proposal or a patch.",
