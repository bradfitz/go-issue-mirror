The\ncore issue is that it is impossible to distinguish the case\n\n/* some text\n\tindented text\n\t*/\n\nstarting at the left-most column from the case\n\n\t/* some text\n\tindented text\n\t*/\n\nbecause there is no exact white-space information available for the first line to the\nleft of the opening /* (there is column information, but even \nwith knowing the actual characters before the /* on the same line, without knowing the\ntab width, the information is not very useful).  Thus, both \nthese cases look the same for the comment formatting algorithm. Changing the formatting\nsuch that the first case comes out as:\n\n/* some text\n\tindented text\n*/\n\nwill change the second case such that it comes out as\n\n\t/* some text\n\t\tindented text\n\t*/\n\nThis may be ok, but on the other hand, the issue can be circumvented altogether by\nformatting the comment with an \"empty\" first line and it will \nwork as expected:\n\n/*\n\tindented text\n\t*/\n\nwill come out as\n\n/*\n\tindented text\n*/\n\nWill close this as \"works as intended\" for now.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
