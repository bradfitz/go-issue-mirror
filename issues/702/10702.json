	"body": "If we can get some indication of the compiler or toolchain version into the build ID hash, it would let people flip between different toolchains with the same GOPATH more easily. In particular, when you flipped it would notice that all the things in $GOROOT/pkg are out of date and rebuild them, whereas today you have to use go install -a or else you get object version conflicts from the compiler and/or linker.\n\n[Please do not close this as a duplicate of some other issue. This one describes what I plan to do.]",
