For example, Apple\ncontributed Objective-C specific routines to tell gdb not to set breakpoints on\ntrampoline code, but to get the address of the next dispatched function and break there\ninstead.\n\ngdb/infrun.c has the logic for deciding where stepping breakpoints will go (see the\ninfrun debug trace in coment #13 and grep for those messages), and gdb/objc-lang.c ::\nobjc_skip_trampoline() is an example of such language-specific logic.\u003c/pre\u003e",
