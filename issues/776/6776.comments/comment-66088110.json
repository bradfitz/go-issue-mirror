In the\nmeantime, here is a suggested temporary workaround:\n\nIf I change go1.2rc3/go/src/pkg/runtime/sys_x86.c:36 from\n    if(pc[0] == 0xeb) { // jmp 1-byte offset\nto\n    if(pc[0] == 0xeb || pc[0] == 0xcc) { // jmp 1-byte offset                 \n\nthen the gdb experience is much better. Step-in 's' and step-over 'n' instructions\nsometimes result in continuing 'c' instead of stepping and stopping, but we don't panic\nthe whole program in a work-halting crash. \n\nAs a result, with this patch in place, it simply means I have to add additional\nbreakpoints further along in the code. This is similar to using gdb on some C++ code\nthat I've experienced in the past. Not horrible, and much better than panic-ing.\n\n- Jason\u003c/pre\u003e",
