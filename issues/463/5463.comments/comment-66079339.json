I've had it happen for multiple projects, some of them had makefiles to clean\nthe resulting binary files, and all of them were not being stripped.\n\nThe only case where -ldflags '-s' does anything at all in Go 1.1 is when building single\nsource files without any external dependencies on packages other than the ones included\nwith golang.\n\nI've just tried to build one of the failing projects using \"go build -ldflags '-s'\n\u0026lt;file with main\u0026gt;.go\" and it was still not being stripped. So this really looks\nlike it's some kind of problem related to building projects with external packages.\n\nNone of these issues were present in Go 1.0.3 and I can get rid of them just by\nswitching to 1.0.3.\u003c/pre\u003e",
