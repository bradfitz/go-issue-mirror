	"body": "I think @neild is proposing snapshotting the whole heap profile as of process growth (and perhaps reporting all allocations, not just \"live\" ones?), not just sampling the allocation that caused process growth.\r\n\r\nI believe that's technically feasible, though I worry about the performance cost of it, since there's some cost to taking that snapshot and when the process grows it tends to grow several times in quick succession. I also worry a bit about the cognitive cost of having another profiling mode, though perhaps it would make sense to expose it as a distinct class of profile, since the semantics are fairly different from the existing heap profile. Also, in the worst case of process growth, when you get an OOM, it's too late to get any useful profile out of the runtime, so I think the answer has to be a tool that can extract a profile out of a core file (which we're working towards).",
