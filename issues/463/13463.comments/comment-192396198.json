	"body": "As an example of how current memory profiles are confusing: I wrote a program that allocates 500 1M slices and retains them all. pprof reports that it is using 225M. If I call runtime.GC, the heap profile catches up and pprof reports on the full 500M.\r\n\r\nThe program uses 500M of memory, it has no garbage, and yet pprof reports a figure half its total memory consumption. Results are the same with --alloc_space/--inuse_space.",
