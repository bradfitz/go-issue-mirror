	"body": "\u003e This question comes in many related flavors, such as \"why is my RSS x?\" and \"why was my process OOM-killed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Current\" profile won't help to answer these questions (unless you capture the profile in kill handler, which is slightly separate topic). To answer these questions you need profile at the beginning of GC cycle (or \"max\" stable profile; for concurrent GC it probably should be samples between marking and sweeping). The maximum heap is what determines RSS. Consider that GC runs once per several minutes, if you just sample \"current\" heap, you almost never will see the maximum.\r\n\r\nI suspect that \"current' profile will lead even to more confusion, because you can observe profile closer to min, or to max, or somewhere in between and see radically different numbers. And even if you understand that you are sampling \"current\", it is difficult to understand where are you between min and max and how to interpret these numbers.\r\n\r\n\u003e What about pprof --alloc_space/--alloc_objects? It seems like that addresses this point almost exactly, but is still more well-defined.\r\n\r\nHow can they help to understand RSS?\r\nI see only how to use them for performance optimization: alloc_space helps to reduce frequency of GCs, alloc_objects helps to reduce malloc overhead.\r\n",
