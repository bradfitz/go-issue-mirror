Not to contradict your findings, but\ninterlanguage microbenchmarks like these don't often correspond to real-world uses and\ncan put undue attention on internal details.\n\nWhen I turned buffering on in Go rather than off in C and did the comparison, Go was\nagain 3X off compared to C. For a new language with all-native libraries (unlike Python,\nwhose I/O is done with C code), that's not too \"painful\". It will improve.\n\npackage main\n\nimport \"bufio\"\nimport \"fmt\"\nimport \"os\"\n\nfunc main() {\n\tb := bufio.NewWriter(os.Stdout)\n\tfor i := 0; i \u0026lt; 1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;25; i++ {\n\t\tfmt.Fprintln(b, i)\n\t}\n}\u003c/pre\u003e",
