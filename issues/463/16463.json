What did you do?\r\n\r\n - Clone https://github.com/stripe/sequins\r\n - Check out https://github.com/stripe/sequins/commit/011971aa3b593f169f8f53a7e07d427377f4bcb8 (the `compressed-sequencefiles` branch)\r\n - Run `make sequins`.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n  Successful build output!\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n  It's failing to build on the last step with duplicate symbols:\r\n\r\n        duplicate symbol _snappy_compress in:\r\n            /var/folders/3d/ymqb8kcx5jv4s2gsqy7rd83h0000gn/T/go-link-410495653/000000.o\r\n            /var/folders/3d/ymqb8kcx5jv4s2gsqy7rd83h0000gn/T/go-link-410495653/000003.o\r\n\r\nI can also reproduce on linux; here's a [travis build](https://api.travis-ci.org/jobs/146532902/log.txt?deansi=true).\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be that I have a diamond dependency on a local static library. I vendor and build a version of snappy, which is in turn used by [sparkey](https://github.com/spotify/sparkey), which I also build, and that is in turn used by a vendored version of [go-sparkey](https://github.com/bsm/go-sparkey), which is used in my app.\r\n\r\nThat had all been working fine (you can check out the `1.0` branch to see it in action). The issue arose when I introduced another dependency on snappy, in [`sequencefile/snappy.go`](https://github.com/stripe/sequins/blob/011971aa3b593f169f8f53a7e07d427377f4bcb8/sequencefile/snappy.go). Then the build started breaking.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, the dependency graph looks like this (see the [Makefile](https://github.com/stripe/sequins/blob/011971aa3b593f169f8f53a7e07d427377f4bcb8/Makefile) for reference):\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/821775/17043715/4c4c306e-4f6e-11e6-93b1-e88db28a87b6.png)\r\n\r\nEverything was working before I added the brach on the right; the [linked commit](https://github.com/stripe/sequins/commit/011971aa3b593f169f8f53a7e07d427377f4bcb8) contains the full set of changes that break the build.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the help! Sorry this is gnarly.\r\n",
