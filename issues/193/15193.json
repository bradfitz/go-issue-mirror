	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nAll platforms\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nSuppose we have a struct with a tags.\r\n``` \r\n    type Foo struct {\r\n        Bar string    `db:\"bar\" json:\"bar\"`\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIf there is a TAB symbol before the json, it makes the json tag unreadable (we get ^Ijson instead).\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n \r\n - It would be nice to have a warning during go vet run or\r\n - It might be automatically corrected by the go fmt or\r\n - go can treat TAB in tags as a whitespace\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\njson tag is silently ignored\r\n\r\n\r\n",
