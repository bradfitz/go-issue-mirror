	"body": "It would be impossible to automatically track down all possible dependencies on external state (e.g. database contents, network interactions), so it seems like a line must be drawn in the sand, and users must understand where that line is and how it determines when they can rely on the caching mechanism.\r\n\r\nRight now, it looks like it only hashes the source files, and to me that seems like a simple and easy to understand demarcation. It may be crude, but that also means it's simple and easy to remember.\r\n\r\nOur tests take about 3.5 minutes and getting that down to a small fraction for incremental changes is really nice. I'm going to start using gt regularly and see how it goes. So far, so good.",
