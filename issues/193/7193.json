Seems they have a long term plan\nto introduce TLV-style data representation over routing socket like netlink stuff, but\nnot in FreeBSD 10 (and probably 11).\n\nWe need to re-define if_data and also keep previous if_data internally, and then handle\nboth appropriately by using if_msghdrl (the 'l' version) instead of conventional\nif_msghdr.\u003c/pre\u003e",
