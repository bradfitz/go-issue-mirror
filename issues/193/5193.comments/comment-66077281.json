You can get the Go code with \"go get launchpad.net/juju-core/worker/uniter\".\n\nThe tests will not run unless you have an SSL-capable mongod binary in your path.\nYou can grab one from\n\u003ca href=\"http://juju-dist.s3.amazonaws.com/tools/mongo-2.2.0-precise-amd64.tgz\"\u003ehttp://juju-dist.s3.amazonaws.com/tools/mongo-2.2.0-precise-amd64.tgz\u003c/a\u003e . The sha1sum of\nthat tar archive is 608f4a5b84b8a4cfab8484aa90976f051382b957.\n\nOnce you've done that, \"go test launchpad.net/juju-core/worker/uniter\" should reproduce\nthe problem about one time in four. If you want to run it with the race detector, you'll\nneed to raise the test timeout (I used 2h though that's overkill)\n\nI'm sorry I haven't managed to reduce the amount of code involved.\n\nFor now, I'm reverting to Go revision 15909.\u003c/pre\u003e",
