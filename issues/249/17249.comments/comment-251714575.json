With that change, we were able to observe poll returning every time another process on the system called `read()` or `write()` on a socket connected to `/dev/log`. Effectively, the poll loop is waking up twice every time another process writes to syslog.\r\n\r\nThis obviously isn't ideal, but it's also a small and bounded amount of work. We think that it is not worth putting a workaround into Go for this. If the slight extra CPU is causing problems for your application, we recommend upgrading to a newer kernel.",
