I don't see how to handle this without having to constantly change the state of the epoll descriptor.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about when this was actually fixed upstream. @tpotega, you mentioned these changes were backported to 3.10.0. Do you know what upstream change they were backported from? Based on the version numbers you gave, I assume this is a RedHat kernel, but I can't figure out how to get any useful log of their backporting activity.",
