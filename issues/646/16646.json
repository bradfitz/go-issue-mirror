I don't have a reliable way to reproduce it, it's inside a huge project, but [here's the complete stack dump](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tgerring/go-ethereum/build/develop.298#L236) if it helps, at least to provide some hints whether it's our code or Go. (I assume the fault is on our end but I haven't ever seen this message so can't trace is properly).",
