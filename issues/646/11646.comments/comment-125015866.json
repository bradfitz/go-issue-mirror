	"body": "One problem @rsc mentioned was the allocation of state data, but he gave me a solution so I don't think that will be a big problem.\r\n\r\nAfter looking some more at the rune vs byte issue, I don't think we would need to skip the DFA for non-ascii regexps. The DFA makes a set of character ranges, and indexes the output transitions by range. We could do the same range lookup for input runes \u003c 256 (or some other arbitrary table size) and do a slower lookup for larger runes.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are a number of other things that don't map easily. I think most of those will have replacements and for any that don't we'll be able to do something slightly slower than RE2 but still be much faster than the nfa matcher.",
