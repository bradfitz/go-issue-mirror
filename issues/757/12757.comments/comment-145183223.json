I would specifically be interested in the type specification (wireType and friends) and the generation of encoding machines.\r\n\r\nThese components are implicitly stabilized since they either appear on the wire or generate data on the wire for use by programs possibly compiled against multiple versions of Go1. So adding a stable developer-facing API to them would not appreciably restrict future development of the standard libraries any more than is already the case.",
