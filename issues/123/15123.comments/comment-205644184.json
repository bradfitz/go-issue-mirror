Apart from SetMaxIdleConns  and SetMaxOpenConns all functionality implemented. Given the fact that my implementation breaks the whole api, implementation is purely done in a third party manner (without touching to std lib code)\r\n\r\nFor the ref, you can find the docs here https://godoc.org/github.com/cihangir/ctxdb\r\n\r\nI would like to help on the implementation if need.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\n\u003e Automatic rollback on cancellation would be desirable, no?\r\n\r\nI tried to achieve this by closing the connection to the [database](https://github.com/cihangir/ctxdb/blob/ca4e0c809743fbc4f3ee5ef2c769ea166d9480ac/ctxdb.go#L336) Some of the database vendors handle it properly, but i am not sure if it is a general solution.",
