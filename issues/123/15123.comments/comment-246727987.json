	"body": "I had give a sample above. Oracle's serializable is just snapshot isolation because ANSI/ISO SQL-92's definition of serializable is unconsistent. You can see snapshot isolation is not true serializable [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_isolation). Old versions of PostgreSQL use similar definition as Oracle, but it rename it to repeatable read and provide serializable snapshot isolation now as serializable which is true serializable. I think old versions of MySQL are also unconsistent.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n@kardianos You can also see what ISO defines [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)#Isolation_levels), it only defines 4 levels and its serializable only require to be stricter than repeatable read with no phantom read, which both snapshot isolation and serializable snapshot isolation satisfy.\r\n\r\nSnapshot isolation is called repeatable read in current version of PostgreSQL, because it bring no performance hit against the weaker form of repeatable read. Note that this also satisfy ISO's definition of repeatable read, because it says this level **can** have phantom reads, so can well be no phantom read.",
