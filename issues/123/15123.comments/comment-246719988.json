Database can support vendor defined flags other than isolation level and access mode, this will cover that.\r\n\r\nFor users using the database, they probably just want to use isolation level name defined by their vendor, and don't want to map it to what others mean. Note that even ISO standard is not consistent. I'm not saying this is the best way to use a database, but that is what happen if the developer just read the vendor  docs. ",
