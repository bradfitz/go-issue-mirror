	"body": "@kardianos Your list for transaction isolation level is enough, except I will put IsoSnapshot before IsoSerializable. But you can have other vendor specific flags that can be passed to when starting a transaction, For example, Oracle has some flags to specify rollback segment for a transaction, and I don't think that is universal across vendor, you can see that [here](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQLRF/statements_10005.htm). And there other flags for the wire protocol [here](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/LNOCI/oci17msc006.htm#i458405).\r\n\r\nOh, and ReadOnly should be a access mode, not a isolation level.\r\n\r\nAnother concern is that if you define those contants for user code in `database/sql`, you will also need to syncing it in `database/sql/driver` for driver implementation, or the opposite way.",
