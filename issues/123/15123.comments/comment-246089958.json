Cancel the rollback then close the connection to let the database start the rollback again? I'm talking about the `TxContext` interface.\r\n\r\n- It still seems racy if you return early and let the operation in-flight for drivers that doesn't support cancellation. You can insert the rollback after the operation, but you need to first check whether it had been canceled, that check could happen after the concurrent set. Or you need to close the physical connection and let the database handle the auto rollback. And for `Commit()` that can't be cancel, you still have to wait.",
