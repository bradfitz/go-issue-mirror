Your make unit-test slowdown looks unexpected. 10m vs 1m30 sounds like a lot more work is being done before the tests start.\r\n\r\n@davecheney The unit tests were exactly the same for the two runs. The tests are compiled and then executed for the `make test-unit` tests.\r\n\r\nI'll provide more details after I track down some some specific regressions.
