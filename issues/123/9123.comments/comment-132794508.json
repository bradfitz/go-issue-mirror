	"body": "Well, my pretty complex Go program (sorry, it's not open source) consistently completes in about 32 seconds when compiled with Go 1.4.2. Note: the first line of my code is this: `runtime.GOMAXPROCS(runtime.NumCPU())`\r\nThe exact same and unmodified(!) code compiled with Go 1.5 (released today!) not only compiles a bit slower but consistently completes in about 50 seconds on every run.\r\nPlatform is Windows 7 (64-bit).\r\nI'm sorry, but I cannot provide example code. My program is highly optimized (I used to write programs in Assembly language before, so I know what I am talking about) and it is a converter program. I use the folllowing 3rd party library extensively: [goquery](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery)\r\nI was extremely excited that Go 1.5 got released today (was looking for this release for over 2 months) but I'll downgrade back to Go 1.4.2 tomorrow because of this extreme performance degradation...\r\nI am sorry, that I cannot provide the source code of my program, but it is not public. :(",
