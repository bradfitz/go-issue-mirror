I guess it would be possible to transplant my code into cmd/internal/goobj and write some more focused benchmarks.\r\n\r\nI've been a bit guilty of making a whole bunch of changes and not measuring the impact of each one, but I'm pretty sure the biggest change is using a symbol table, which means many fewer calls to expandpkg and many fewer map lookups and consequent string hashing. It also makes the .a files quite a bit (20%?) smaller, which obviously reduces the IO required to read them...\r\n\r\nHaving a string block so you are converting []byte to string just the once and allocating all the strings/data read from the file as slices of one big string/data block certainly helps a bit too, and those are dependent on changing the format too.",
