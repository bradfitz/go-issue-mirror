There are many things that can be fixed up to make processing them faster, and I'd love to see this happen.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I don't believe it makes snse to ELF or some other standard object file format. Shoehorning Go's needs into that object file will, I expect, cause more problems than it would bring benefits. But if you can make the case otherwise, I'm certainly willing to listen.",
