	"body": "Although this is closed now, @ianlancetaylor wanted me to also clear up the direction i'm taking with future changes to the format and this seems like the right place to do it.\r\nSome directions i would like to explore are:\r\n1) Split out a strings section (Michael's proposol includes this as well).\r\n2) Define section boundries, it would be nice to do this with a standard format such as zip (uncompressed for starts).\r\n3) Add some more sizing information in the spirit of the mentioned 21026. \r\n4) Add some information that would make parsing in multiple goroutines possible, probably splitting some of the sections into chunks. The chunks would be read sequentially but parsed in parallel.  I believe inserting symbols into the map is the only thing that would need to be done serially.\r\n5) Add length prefixing to entire symbols so they can be discarded easier.\r\n6) Explore if adding a type field to symbols and deduplicating the content part of the symbol name is worthwhile (Isn't too complex and gives a good space saving). As an example go.string.\"some string\" and go.string.hdr.\"same string\" would have a different type but the same string. ",
