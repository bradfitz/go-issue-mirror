I'm requesting this in behalf of others, so they would\nhave to comment on their specific needs.\n\nTo give a more specific example in my case, LockBefore(Time) function would be useful in\nthe case of:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/src/pkg/io/pipe.go\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/src/pkg/io/pipe.go\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/src/pkg/net/pipe.go\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/src/pkg/net/pipe.go\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIn implementing SetReadDeadline and SetWriteDeadline.\n\nI believe that sync.Mutex should be more in parity with other languages; Just because a\nchannel can do something doesn't mean sync.Mutex should be left incomplete. I would\nrather be given the choice rather than no choice at all.\n\nTryLock/GetLock/Acquire (or whatever you call it) should be easy to implement. So there\nis really no reason why it shouldn't be. LockBefore(Time) should be implemented to, but\nI understand that introducing a timed delay is more complex with the scheduler.\u003c/pre\u003e",
