I don't care what you call it. \"CanLock\" says \"Can I\nLock\" not \"Get a Lock if you can\".\n\nJava, Ruby, C++ (std::), and Objective-C have a TryLock function (and call it that),\njust to name a few. Python has a single `Acquire(block bool) bool` function.\n\nWhy do you not want this? The sync.Mutex package is greatly limited compared to other\nlanguages. Just because Go has channels doesn't mean the sync.Mutex package should be\nleft incomplete. Developers should be able to choose which to use: channel or mutex.\nThey shouldn't be forced to use channels or fend for themselves.\u003c/pre\u003e",
