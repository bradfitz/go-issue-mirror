I posted a link, so hopefully\nothers can give you a more concrete examples. There have also been other topics about it\nin the past, and I'm sure it will come up again and again.\n\nThe only example I can think of off the top of my head: When protecting a value, like a\nbuffer, that you would otherwise use a sync.Mutex/sync.RWMutex, and you wanted to have a\nblocking (uses Lock()) and non-blocking call (uses TryLock()). A situation where you'd\nend up doing something like this:\n\nlock := make(chan bool)\n...\nselect {\ncase \u0026lt;-lock:\n// do something\ndefault:\n    return errors.New(\"Busy\")\n}\n\nWhen this would have been much more concise:\n\nif m.TryLock() == false {\n    return errors.New(\"Busy\")\n}\n// do something\n\nChannels are also harder in this situation when you need a sync.RWMutex.\u003c/pre\u003e",
