	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)? 1.6\r\n\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)? OS X, darwin-64\r\n\r\n\r\n3. What did you do? \r\nAttempted to use http Client for HTTP/2\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nClient supported HTTP/2\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nClient only supported HTTP 1.1\r\n\r\nYou must still use golang.org/x/net/http2 ConfigureTransport to create an HTTP/2 client. I verified this with the http2.golang.org. Both the http docs and the golang.org/x/net/http2 docs imply that the 1.6 http package now automatically support HTTP/2 for both Client and Server. They do not.\r\n",
