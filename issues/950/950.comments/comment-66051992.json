Any required dependencies will be installed\nautomatically.\n\nYou can't goinstall SDL because of the cgo problem, but in general\nyou have to goinstall the directory with the code, so it would be\n\ngoinstall github.com/banthar/Go-SDL/sdl\n\nfor example.  Or goinstall on a program that\nimported \"github.com/banthar/Go-SDL/sdl\".\nBut again it doesn't play well with cgo yet.\n\n\"godoc goinstall\" will explain more.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
