	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI am working in a severely bandwidth-limited environment and am trying to strip down the\nhttp responses generated by net/http. I would like to prevent the Content-Type and\nConnection headers from being inserted into the http response. (The Connection header\nshould be safe to remove at least for HTTP/1.0 requests.) It does not currently seem\npossible.\n\nI would ideally like this to remove the Content-Type and Connection headers (it\ncurrently works for removing the Date header):\n\n\theader := resp.Header()\n\theader[\u0026quot;Content-Type\u0026quot;] = nil\n\theader[\u0026quot;Connection\u0026quot;] = nil\n\n\nAs a bonus bug:\n\n\theader[\u0026quot;Content-Type\u0026quot;] = []string{\u0026quot;\u0026quot;}\n\ncauses duplicate Content-Type headers in the response:\n\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nContent-Type: \nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 0\nConnection: close\n\n\nI would be happy to write a patch for this, if so desired.\n\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\n1.1.1\u003c/pre\u003e",
