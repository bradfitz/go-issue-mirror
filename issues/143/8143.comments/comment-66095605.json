You say that \"these functions are operating on UTF-8\" -- but no,\nUTF-8 only enters into it in the special case of old being empty. Consider\n\nutf8.Valid(bytes.Replace([]byte(\"世界\"), []byte{184}, nil, -1)) // false\n\nSo the special case behavior for empty 'old' is quite surprising. This bug arose from a\ncase where the UTF-8 behavior of bytes.Replace was undesired and ultimately a custom\nreplace function was needed.\n\nbytes.Split becomes UTF-8 aware only when provided with an empty separator, but that is\nwell-documented.\u003c/pre\u003e",
