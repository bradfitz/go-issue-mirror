The scheduled code does:\r\n\r\n    v88 = CMPLconst \u003cflags\u003e [8] v48\r\n    v86 = SBBLcarrymask \u003cint8\u003e v88\r\n    ... do things that clobber flags...\r\n    v87 = SBBLcarrymask \u003cuint32\u003e v88\r\n\r\nv88 is not spilled and restored properly.  There are 3 issues:\r\n1) Regalloc doesn't know that the intervening instructions clobber flags.\r\n2) We can't spill/restore flags.\r\n3) The two SBBLs aren't CSEd because their types are different.\r\n\r\n1 is about to be fixed with the new regalloc.\r\n2 is to be done, but no timeline yet.\r\n3 Josh was thinking about.  Maybe remove types from (most?) values, they aren't used in many places.\r\n\r\nWith just 1 we'll at least get a \"can't be regalloced\" error instead of silently generating wrong code.",
