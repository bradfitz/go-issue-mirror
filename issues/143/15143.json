	"body": "git mail \u003chash\u003e allows one to specify which of a set of CLs to mail, but git change has no such ability. When one stacks CLs in a single branch, as I do often, it's nice to be able to manage them individually.\r\n\r\ngit rebase-work provides this functionality but it seems like there's an asymmetry between mail and change that could be fixed.\r\n",
