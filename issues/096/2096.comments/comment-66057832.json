In your example, -vvvv names the\nflag \"vvvv\", whatever that is.\n\nYou can't implement something like \"ls -lrt\" either.\nOne flag per option argument.\n\nThere are various wrappings of GNU getopt, though I have not yet\nseen one as nice to use as package flag.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
