So flag can't even\nsupport it as -v -v -v -v.\n\nI'd rather avoid wrappers for packages already included. It would be nice to enhance\nflag to support a more standard flag parsing style (yea, i think GNU getopts style is by\nfar the most common style).\n\nIt's possible to enhance it in a way that is compatible. Simply provide a flag in\nflag.go to enable getopt_long compliance. And then, all multi-letter flag names require\n--name and -abc is parsed as -a -b -c. Without getopt_long (the default) it works as it\ndoes now.\n\nBut that still doesn't address multiple like -v -v -v -v. flag.Array* functions are all\nthat's needed. Again, remaining compatible with current usage.\n\nConsequently, while flag is a nice implementation, it's also very rudimentary without\nany real reason except time for not supporting a more robust style.\u003c/pre\u003e",
