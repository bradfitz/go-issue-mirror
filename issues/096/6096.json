Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Try to return a non-zero process exit code from the main function while letting\nexecute all deferred functions.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/mAf3Oyb_W9\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/mAf3Oyb_W9\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nIt should be possible to execute all deferred functions even in cases where the exit\ncode of the process is not equal to zero.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nSince the main function does not allow to return an exit code, the os.Exit call must be\nused. This prevents deferred functions from being executed.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nn.n.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows 7\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.1 windows/amd64\u003c/pre\u003e",
