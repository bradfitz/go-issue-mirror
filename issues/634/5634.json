	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe language permits shadowing with := as long as both variables are used after they are\ndefined.  However, it would be reasonable for go vet to warn if := is used to define a\nlocal variable when there is a local variable of the same name in an enclosing block.\n\nExample: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/DQDXOyfwRl\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/DQDXOyfwRl\u003c/a\u003e .  A quick glance might  lead one to think\nthis program would print 2, but it prints 0.\u003c/pre\u003e",
