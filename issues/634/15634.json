	"body": "The disparity in behavior between `go install` and `go build` is confusing.\r\n\r\nSubsequent builds with `go build` are slow and it doesn't really make sense why.\r\n\r\n`go install` is required to install dependent packages, but there's no control (other than `$GOBIN`) about the final location of the binary.\r\n\r\nI propose adding a flag to `go build` (like `-install`), or alternatively supporting the `-o` flag for `go install`.",
