Most of debug/dwarf looks\nsloppy, honestly (I can say that, because I wrote it).\n\nIn general we have tried to avoid adding new API in point releases. We don't even have\nbuild tags for point releases. So there's no way to use the new type safely.\n\nI don't think there are enough users of debug/dwarf to do this right now. Argue if you\ndisagree.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.4**, removed **release-go1.3.1**._",
