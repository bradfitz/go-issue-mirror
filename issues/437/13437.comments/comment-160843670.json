It would seem that the test cases that are Windows specific would fail on other OS: https://golang.org/src/path/filepath/path_test.go#L98\r\n\r\nIn case someone runs into the same issue, I fixed the problem locally by not using `filepath.Join` and using `strings.Join(pathItems, \"/\")` since the version of Windows I'm targeting properly handles these paths.",
