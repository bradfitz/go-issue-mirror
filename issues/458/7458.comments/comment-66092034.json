If\ngofmt'ed explicitly, the error messages are:\n\nx.go:51:6: expected function/method call\nx.go:52:70: expected ')', found 'func'\nx.go:62:5: expected statement, found ')'\nx.go:72:3: expected '}', found 'EOF'\n\nThe 2nd error is what you'd expect (more or less). Error messages are reported in sorted\norder, so even though the 2nd error is actually the first error encountered during\nparsing, the error on line 51 comes first (and is caused by the 2nd and its follow-up\nerrors).\n\nThe parser could be smarter about what to report (if anything) for line 51 in this case.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.3maybe**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
