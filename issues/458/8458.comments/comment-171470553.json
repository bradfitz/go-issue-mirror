	"body": "I know this is old but I would like to add an example data which desperately needs this change to be read. I am currently working with some sentiment analysis stuff which uses SentiWordNet list. A row from the list:\r\n```\r\na\r\n00001740\r\n0.125\r\n0\r\nable#1\r\n(usually followed by `to') having the necessary means or skill or know-how or authority to do something; \"able to swim\"; \"she was able to program her computer\"; \"we were at last able to buy a car\"; \"able to get a grant for the project\"\r\n```\r\nI put each column on a newline so it is easy to distinguish each column. The columns are tab (\\t) delimited and long text does not have an enclosure. Obviously, because the long text already has double quotes in it, the csv package gives me an error trying to parse the quotes. Hope what I wrote makes sense lol.",
