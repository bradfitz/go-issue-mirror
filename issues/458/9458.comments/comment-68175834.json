I think it's a bit more insidious and more likely to be a problem in a normal program, personally, but I'll grant it's subjective.\r\n\r\nYou wrote that you made this issue because you were reading the spec, not because you had a bug in your code.\r\n\r\nIn 3 years / ~100kloc writing Go, I've had this sort of thing bite me just a handful of times. It has happened perhaps equally often as integer overflow and probably fewer times than data race bugs. I don't recall it ever being particularly hard to debug.\r\n\r\nBut I'm just one guy, and it's possible that my experience is atypical.",
