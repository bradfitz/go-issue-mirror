Script and source of runtime all load now.\n\nFYI, the command:\n\n```\nc:\ncd \\\nmkdir \\Users\\ADMINI~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\2\\bindist357622851\ncd \\Users\\ADMINI~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\2\\bindist357622851\nmklink /J go %GOROOT%\n```\n\nAnd it might be a good idea to insert this into the installer as a workaround.\n\n---\n\nHowever the script itself seem to have (the same) problems on both of my windows boxes.\nI'll play more with it and maybe open another issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
