Can you please check and see whether the GOROOT_FINAL\nsubstitution is working correctly on Windows for you? (This is in CL 88300045, which I\njust submitted.)\n\nMy guess is that we are building the distribution in some directory X and getcwd is\nreturning X1 but GOROOT is set to X2. For exmaple getcwd might return c:\\progra~1\\go and\nGOROOT might be set to c:\\program files\\go. In this case the paths beginning\nc:\\progra~1\\go will not be recognized as beginning with GOROOT. The solution would\nprobably be not to set GOROOT at all explicitly during distribution, because then\ncmd/dist will use getcwd to set it, and hopefully it will match what getcwd in the\ncompilers sees.\n\nAnother possibility is that GOROOT was set to c:\\tmp\\go but the file path was c:/tmp/go,\nand so the code did not think the file path began with GOROOT. In my new code\nbackslashes and slashes are treated as equivalent, as are upper-vs-lower case letters,\nso hopefully those kinds of different spellings won't be an issue anymore. If that was\nthe problem with Andrew's distribution, then maybe it is already fixed. If the problem\nis an 8.3 name vs a long name that's a little trickier.\u003c/pre\u003e",
