Things that aren't pointers are now stored by reference.  So to make an int into an interface we have to allocate an int on the heap and store a *int in the interface data word.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we could allocate that int on the stack instead of the heap.  I think that is #13807 or #8618.",
