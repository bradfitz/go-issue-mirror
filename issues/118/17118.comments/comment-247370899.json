	"body": "1. It's possible we could specialize convT2E calls for particular common sizes to avoid going through typedmemmove. There are trade-offs here, but it might be worth investigating.\r\n2. @dr2chase wants to change the calling convention in general. That's probably worth doing. Changing it just for one call ain't gonna happen.\r\n3. We've inlined a bunch of these. Those that are left aren't worth inlining because they still make other function calls (notably allocation) anyway.\r\n\r\nI can't look into this myself, since I'm leaving on vacation in a few hours. But I'm going to reopen this in case anyone (@martisch?)  wants to investigate creating a few specialized convT2E variants.\r\n",
