Since\nit \nseems that changing it to be required will not happen, we should have good diagnostics\nto help \npeople know when it has been omitted incorrectly.\n\nConsider foo.go:\n\npackage main\nfunc main() {\n\ti := 1\n\ti = i + i\n}\n\nIf you do 6g foo.go, the error message printed is:\n\n$ 6g foo.go\nfoo.go:4: syntax error near i\n\nThe error message should be more detailed since new users may have trouble finding the \nproblem:\n\nfoo.go:4: statements in functions must be separated by semicolons\u003c/pre\u003e",
