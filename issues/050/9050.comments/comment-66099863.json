I only know of three:  Golang's,\nOpenSSL's, and SJCL's, and Golang's implementation is the odd one out when it comes to\nthis:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/e0fc7961c4fbd27577fb519d9aea2dc788742715/crypto/modes/gcm128.c#L846\"\u003ehttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/e0fc7961c4fbd27577fb519d9aea2dc788742715/crypto/modes/gcm128.c#L846\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl/blob/master/core/gcm.js#L133\"\u003ehttps://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl/blob/master/core/gcm.js#L133\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe IETF just seems to give reverence to the NIST specification that was linked earlier.\n\nIt would doubtless be a waste of time to dig through a bunch of open source projects\ntrying to find one case where the nonce is 128-bits and if I did would it really be\npersuasive?\n\nIf blatantly not conforming to the specification and being incompatible with every other\nmajor implementation of GCM isn't enough justification, I... don't know what would be.\u003c/pre\u003e",
