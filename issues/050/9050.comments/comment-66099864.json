We subset nearly everything aggressively in order to try and focus on doing\nwhat's needed rather than trying to do everything.\n\nThe IETF defines AEAD_AES_128_GCM to take exactly a 96-bit nonce\n(\u003ca href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5116#section-5.1\"\u003ehttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5116#section-5.1\u003c/a\u003e : \"N_MIN and N_MAX are both 12 octets\")\nand TLS thus uses a 96-bit nonce.\n\nI'm not against supporting other nonce sizes should it be needed, but your motivation\nappears to be that we should support it simply because it has been defined and I don't\nagree with that.\u003c/pre\u003e",
