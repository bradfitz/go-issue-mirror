	"body": "go/types doesn't care or even know how the package data structure of imported packages came into being, it just cares about the data which is returned by an importer. go/types' access to imported packages is via the importer function which is implemented externally.\r\n\r\nThe go/importer package provides (at the moment) two importers, one for packages compiled by gc and one for packages compiled by gccgo. The documentation in that package explicitly mentions the compilers. But it is correct that it doesn't say that the importers read from the installed binary files.\r\n\r\n@alandonovan has been working on a longer and detailed explanation of how to use go/types and how it all interacts with the source code, installed code, etc. It will be available with the 1.5 release (or shortly thereafter).\r\n",
