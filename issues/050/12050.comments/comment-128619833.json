	"body": "@griesemer thank you for the detailed explanation. For the performance reasons you describe it is probably better to require installation of all packages instead of creating my own source importer. But i guess the documentation or atleast the error message should indicate that imported packages through go/types need to be compiled in order for the library to discover them. Anyways, ill leave that up to you guys. Thanks again!",
