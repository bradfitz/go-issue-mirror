We would have to wait until real\ngomake will come along.\n\nAs to your github.com/mattn/go-xmpp app, please try to use goinstall to download and\nbuild you package and examples. You must use \"-make=false\" goinstall flag, otherwise you\nbuild will fail because mingw \"mkdir -p\" does not work with Windows paths, like\nc:\\a\\b\\c, properly.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **packagechange**._\n\n_Owner changed to @alexbrainman._\n\n_Status changed to **LongTerm**._",
