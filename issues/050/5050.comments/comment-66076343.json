If they have an existing pix buffer, would-be\ncallers can just use an image.Paletted composite literal.\n\nAs for DecodeInto, I would imagine that its signature was\nDecodeInto(dst draw.Image, r io.Reader) (image.Rectangle, error)\nsomewhat similar to how io.Reader takes a buffer and returns an int specifying how many\nbytes were read, but I haven't thought that much about it.\n\nAs for working on this (and changing the standard library), I don't think it's obvious\nwhat the right design is. I'd recommend forking image/gif and experimenting first.\n\nAs for \"What they need to be able to do that is an entry point to the decoder that lets\nthem limit the memory consumption before it happens\", I don't see how DecodeInto helps\nwith that, without requiring to allocate a maximal buffer even if you're just decoding a\n32x32 image.\u003c/pre\u003e",
