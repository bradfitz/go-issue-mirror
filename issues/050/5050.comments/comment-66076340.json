The data returned\nby DecodeConfig says it's a small GIF. Then once the user calls Decode on it, the second\nframe tricks us into calling image.NewPaletted() with giant bounds.\n\nHowever, now it occurs to me that capping the frame size of frames larger than the first\nframe would solve this problem nicely.\u003c/pre\u003e",
