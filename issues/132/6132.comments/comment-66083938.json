(The go4xcode.sh\nscript must be run.)\n\nWill Xcode 5 bring more breakage? It would be nice if the go1.2 binary distribution just\nworks, even when Xcode 5 has been released.\n\nBasically: \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/12858049/\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/12858049/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
