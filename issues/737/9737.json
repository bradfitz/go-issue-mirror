	"body": "At the moment we have two variables affecting the target architecture: GOARCH and GOARM (for GOARCH=arm). That's very inconvenient, probably we should use `arm5`, `arm6` and `arm7` `GOARCH` values, deprecating the `GOARM`.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate that. I'm a developer, that wants to cross-compile application for Linux/armv5 and Linux/armv7. I do: `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=5 go install`. I get the results in `$GOROOT/bin/linux_arm`. But if I want to build the armv7 binary, it goes to the same path as the v5 one, overwriting it (and that's rather frustrating).\r\n\r\nBut if we had a single `GOARCH`, that incorporates the arm version, we would get:\r\n`GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm5 go install =\u003e $GOROOT/bin/linux_arm5`\r\n`GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm7 go install =\u003e $GOROOT/bin/linux_arm7`\r\n\r\nPersonally I find it a much more logical and useful solution. Or I'm overlooking something?",
