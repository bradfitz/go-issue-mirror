If sql.Open had\nopened a connection (which could have been the case, see issue #4804) the patch I\npresented would have been impossible. The second argument should allow you to pass\nanything required by the driver - either a map[string]interface{} or just an interface{}.\n\nOne way you could fix this is by changing the second argument to an interface{}. That\nwould allow a string to be passed as it is now, and allow certain drivers to accept\nother things, like maps.\u003c/pre\u003e",
