It's avaliable in both 32-bit and 64-bit flavors.\r\n\r\nDo we still keep `GOARCH=arm` and tweak `GOARM` in that case?\r\n\r\nBTW, `386` and `amd64` are two different `GOARCH` architectures, although the difference is similar to 32-bit arm7 and 64-bit arm8. We don't have a common `GOARCH=intel` and `GOBITS=32/64` to control that. And that's done for a reason.",
