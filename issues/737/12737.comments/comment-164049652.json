	"body": "This is not just an http2 problem; as pointed out in the [cmux readme's limitations section](https://github.com/soheilhy/cmux#limitations):\r\n\u003e TLS: Since cmux sits in between the actual listener and the mux'ed listeners, TLS handshake is not handled inside the actual servers. Because of that, you can serve HTTPS using cmux but http.Request.TLS would not be set in your handlers.\r\n\r\nThis is really due to the type assertion used to identify TLS connections, which sadly breaks the goodness of net.Conn and net.Listener being interfaces.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the third option implemented, where the type assertion to `tls.Conn` is replaced with a type assertion to an exported interface.",
