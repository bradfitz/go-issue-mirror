So for the test.sh hang to happen the old slave accept\nhas to happen between the master setting the fd blocking and the new slave\nsetting the fd non-blocking. By moving the File call to the beginning, the\nfd gets set non-blocking again by the first slave and thereafter is\nnon-blocking, so the race is gone.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
