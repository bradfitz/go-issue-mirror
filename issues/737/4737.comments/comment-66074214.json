I wanted something where the closes would be\nindependent. It is too bad that the non-blocking mode is not per-fd but we\nknew that at some point in the past, because the File method docs have\nweasel words at the end:\n\n    File sets the underlying os.File to blocking mode and returns a copy. It\n    is the caller's responsibility to close f when finished. Closing c does\n    not affect f, and closing f does not affect c.\n\n    The returned os.File's file descriptor is different from the\n    connection's. Attempting to change properties of the original using this\n    duplicate may or may not have the desired effect.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
