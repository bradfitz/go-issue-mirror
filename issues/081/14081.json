	"body": "It seems if I install a cgo based library into my vendor packages and try to run my main file it takes a very long time to run but if i don't vendor these packages it runs in normal time.\r\nThis is the code I tried to run\r\n```go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n    \"database/sql\"\r\n    _ \"github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3\"\r\n)\r\nvar msDB *sql.DB\r\nfunc main() {\r\n   println(\"StartingDB\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMy GoENV\r\n```\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/home/pyros2097/Code\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/usr/lib/go\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/usr/lib/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64\"\r\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\"1\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n```\r\nI just run `go run main.go` maybe its an issue with the go compiler I guess it doesn't compile cgo based libraries in vendor packages and put them in this folder pkg/linux_amd64 and I think it might be recompiling them everytime just running the sqlite example takes a minute if its vendored.\r\nThe sqlite3 package is present in my `vendor/github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` directory.\r\n\r\nI've posted the issue here also https://github.com/Masterminds/glide/issues/223",
