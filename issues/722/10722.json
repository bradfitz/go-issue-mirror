	"body": "For debugging whether all buildlets are running the latest versions, it would be nice if we could go to some new debug URL, like:\r\n\r\n   http://farmer.golang.org/buildlets\r\n\r\nAnd see for each GOOS-GOARCH, the last-seen buildlet version number.\r\n\r\nFor each build, the buildlet could include its GOOS-GOARCH, build-date, go rev, x/build rev, in some HTTP response header, or in its existing /status JSON reply, and then the buildlet could add it to a global map guarded by some new (or existing statusMu) mutex.\r\n\r\nThen we'd be able to quickly debug that a buildlet is out of date.\r\n\r\n/cc @crawshaw @adg ",
