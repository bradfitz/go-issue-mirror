	"body": "@nigeltao I have a question about this change:\r\n\r\nIn `YCbCr.RGBA()`, the code is a modified copy of `YCbCrToRGB()`:\r\n```\r\n\t// This code is a copy of the YCbCrToRGB function above, except that it\r\n\t// returns values in the range [0, 0xffff] instead of [0, 0xff]. There is a\r\n\t// subtle difference between doing this and having YCbCr satisfy the Color\r\n\t// interface by first converting to an RGBA. The latter loses some\r\n\t// information by going to and from 8 bits per channel.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in `NYCbCrA.RGBA()`, `YCbCrToRGB()` is called, instead of a modified version.\r\nWhy don't we use the same code?\r\nI think we lose some information here.\r\n",
