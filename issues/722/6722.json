This wouldn't be much of a\nbig deal except that the quantity of code needed to work around it is really big and\nrepeats lots of code from the std library.\n\nSee this message: \u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/ht_gQ2ET0c0/efaGZdIxCmAJ\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/ht_gQ2ET0c0/efaGZdIxCmAJ\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIt would be nicer to have crypto/tls.X509EncryptedKeyPair(certPEMBlock, keyPEMBlock,\npassword []byte) (cert Certificate, err error) that would use password to decrypt\nkeyPEMBlock.\u003c/pre\u003e",
