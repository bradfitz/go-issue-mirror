	"body": "Understanding that this is not normal policy, Go 1.7 is new enough in channels that distributions will have a hard time forcing everyone to upgrade to a newer Go runtime (and introducing large amounts of risk of uncovered issues), and so Mac OS being broken for Go 1.6 causes a fairly large amount of pain in the ecosystem.  \r\n\r\nThe risk profile of upgrading something like Kubernetes to Go 1.7  in point releases without a long soak period on 1.7 increases the risk of regressions in other areas.    Each new Go release has taken 1-2 months on Kubernetes to achieve satisfactory soak, and while the community has been fairly good at identifying and closing regressions on new major versions, it becomes very difficult from a release process to justify an upgrade mid-cycle.\r\n\r\nWe are considering carrying a backport for Fedora/CentOS/RHEL Go 1.6 to enable cross-compilation and unbreak those building on 1.6, but we really do prefer to keep the patch list as small as possible.",
