	"body": "I tried the version from the link you provided and even launching \"go version\" throws a floating point loss of precision error on a MULSD instruction inside the go runtime. The rest of the plan9 install that I have seems stable and fine. I've tried some simple floating point in a C program and that seems to work ok too.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of trying to switch over to plan9/amd64 to see if I have better luck there. Is there a plan9 bootstrap tarball for amd64 so that I can try compiling at tip?\r\n\r\nThanks",
