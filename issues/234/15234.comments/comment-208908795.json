	"body": "@0intro thank you. I am up and running now with the trick from @minux. I set GO386=387 to force the compiler to use 387 instructions instead of sse2. I'm assuming that will also work when bootstrapping from Linux/Mac but I haven't tried that yet.\r\n\r\nI am still unsure why sse2 isn't working in this context for me. It could be the virtualbox is not emulating sse2 the way that the Go compiler expects. Perhaps, there is a legitimate bug in the Go compiler on 386. Although, I doubt that last one since I'm sure many people use linux/386 windows/386 and floating point is used in the Go runtime quite a bit.\r\n\r\nI'm running the newest plan9 front (aka 9front) from a week or two ago. My understanding is that it is still compatible with plan9. Would you like me to try bootstrapping Go from tip without the GO386=387 variable? I believe that I am on the latest virtualbox (5.0.16).",
