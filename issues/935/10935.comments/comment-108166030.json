I can test your code if you don't have appropriate environment setup. Good new test will make our task much easier, considering I know little about the subject. Test that breaks with current tip, but PASSes once your changes are applied.\r\n\r\nNo pressure. I will do it myself, if you cannot do it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n",
