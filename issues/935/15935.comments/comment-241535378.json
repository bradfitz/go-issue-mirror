It will even report that it is a timeout. \r\n\r\nThe exact error is usually not needed to decide what to do once the application is running, since complete error enumerations is an endless, never complete task. \r\n\r\nBut what is useful, is to support the decision, whether I should retry (Temporary() == true), ignore it (in the cancel case) or report it.",
