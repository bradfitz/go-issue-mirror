In Go, if the switch contains only constant values in the cases (like in a C switch), there's no reason why the switch cannot be compiled (and perhaps optimized) just like a C switch. Vice versa, a sequence of if-else-if statements where each condition is of the form \"tag == constant\" and only the constant changes could conceivably be recognized by an optimizing compiler and translated into a dispatch via a table (as switch statement might).",
