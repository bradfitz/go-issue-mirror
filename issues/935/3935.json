This\ndoesn’t necessarily mean that something’s wrong with the app. For example, some apps\nwere written before developer ID registration began. However, the app has not been\nreviewed. Also, there is no way for OS X to check whether the app has been modified or\nbroken since it was released. A common way to distribute malware is to take an innocent\napp and insert harmful code into it, and then redistribute the infected app.\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3935/0/Screen%20Shot%202012-08-10%20at%201.00.31%20AM.png\"\u003eScreen Shot 2012-08-10 at 1.00.31 AM.png\u003c/a\u003e (344471 bytes)",
