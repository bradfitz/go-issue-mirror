	"body": "The coordinator's watcher mode (run in Docker) should preserve its git clone checkouts upon restarts.\r\n\r\nWe can use the docker run volume flags to bind mount part of the host OS's disk into the watcher's process. Then on start-up it can just verify things are still cool and not corrupt. If cool (e.g. `git gc` passes in some check-only mode), it uses it. If not, it nukes it and re-clones.\r\n\r\nThis would speed start-up and hackability.\r\n\r\n/cc @adg ",
