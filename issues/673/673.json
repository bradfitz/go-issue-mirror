	"body": "by **consalus**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI managed to trigger the bug in a non-trivial bit of xml parsing I was \ndoing. Apologies that I don't have a test case, but the result of the \nCharData for\n\u0026lt;TagName\u0026gt;Data Inside of Tag\u0026lt;/TagName\u0026gt;\nwas\n\u0026quot;TagNameide of Tag\u0026quot;.\nThat is, it seemed like other parsing had overwritten the CharData.\nLooking at the code, it seems that a slice from p.buf is being returned \ndirectly in xml.Parser.text(). When I changed xml.Parser.RawToken to\nreturn CharData(data).Copy() instead of just CharData(data), the issue went \naway.\n\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\ndarwin 386\n\nWhich revision are you using?
