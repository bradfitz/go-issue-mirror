	"body": "MySQL recently announced a new protocol, MySQL X protocol for talking to MySQL as of 5.7.12. See: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/x-protocol.html. One of the current features it offers are \"command pipelining\" which current database/sql does not support. It's not clear from comments above if that sort of behaviour would be able to fit into the new driver being discussed here. Certainly database/sql as it stands is unable to support this and also has no hooks to poke into the lower level driver to make use of these features. I'm currently looking at writing a driver to support this protocol and am not sure how to expose as much of the functionality as possible via database/sql which would be more convenient as writing a completely new driver would require a much larger investment.  So this issue seems to be the most attractive solution to follow.",
