If there are people who want to hack on this but don't feel like they can because it's in the standard library, please come forward. You have my blessing to hack on any of the open issues:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20in%3Atitle%20database\r\n\r\nI think moving to x/ will only split the community, back to how it was before database/sql was in the standard library.\r\n\r\nBut I agree it's probably time to give database/sql some more love. With the Go 1.8 tree open, we have three months. Now's the time for everybody to start hacking.\r\n\r\n",
