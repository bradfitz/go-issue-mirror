What I had in mind is a way to send a query and be able to send another one prior to having received the result set of the first and doing this over the _same_ connection.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see use of db.Query() is currently synchronous, and therefore depends to some extent on the combination of network and query latency.  Pipelining here helps if you can send the next query prior to having processed the results of the previous one.",
