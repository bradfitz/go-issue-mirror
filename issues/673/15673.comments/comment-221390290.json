(See #15824)\r\n\r\nEither reflect.Type.Method should expose all unexported methods, or it should expose none of them. Anything else is just too confusing. What reflect.Type.Method returns should be a distinct question from reflect.Type.Implements's behavior--the former can elide unexported methods while the latter considers them.\r\n\r\nI'm curious how changing the output of reflect.Type.Method is consistent with the compatibility guarantee.",
