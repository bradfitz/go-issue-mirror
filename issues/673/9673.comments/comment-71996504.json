	"body": "Seems easy to fix because we already use a pointer to access C variables,\r\nwe just need to move the definition of the pointer from _cgo_gotypes.go to\r\n.cgo2.c. But we also need to add unique hash to the global name in case\r\nthe static C variable is used in multiple cgo packages.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is that we must make sure to only emit the pointer definition\r\nonce. Can cmd/cgo detect if one variable definition is static?\r\n\r\nI don't want to go the SWIG way, because Go is more capable than common\r\nscripting languages and can access most C variables/constants without going\r\nthrough accessor functions.",
