It first looks for a field whose name (or tag) exactly matches the value.  If it doesn't find one, it looks for a field that matches using a case insensitive comparison.  It is not the case that both matches are case insensitive.\r\n\r\nCan you offer a suggestion as to how to improve the documentation?",
