	"body": "We now have a command buffer and a thread switch between when a GL method is called in Go and when it is executed in the driver, making it hard to debug a segfault or similar from the GL driver (see #12718 for an example).\r\n\r\nThis could be improved in -tags gldebug mode by shrinking the workbuffer from 3 to 1, and turning all GL calls into blocking calls. Then a Go panic would at least include the name of the GL function that caused the segfault.",
