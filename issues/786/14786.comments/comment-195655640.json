There'll also be work in sinit.go and elsewhere to use these newfound powers.\r\n\r\nThe Progs in unicode mostly get generated in sinit.go, func staticassign, case OSTRUCTLIT, call to gdata. gdata then jumps through a bunch of hoops (gc Gins, x86 gins, gc Prog, gc Naddr, etc.) and spits out a single Prog with a single int attached. Similar things happen throughout sinit.go.\r\n\r\nTo measure how many Progs were being generated, I just stuck some fmt.Printlns in \"*Link\".NewProg (cmd/internal/obj/util.go) for the new(Prog) branch that printed out ctxt.Cursym.Name and ran the output through [pct](https://github.com/josharian/pct).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
