	"body": "When compiling the `unicode` package, every single int in the static data (e.g. the RangeTables) gets its own Prog. (It also gets its own Node and Mpint, but that's another matter; see also #4617.) This blows through the Prog cache that @randall77 put into place and a lot more. Rather than generating a sequence of linked ADATA Progs and then writing them out, we should create fewer ADATA Progs containing more data, or maybe write it out even more directly like obj.Setuintxx.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how or where the right place to do this is. Advice welcomed.\r\n",
