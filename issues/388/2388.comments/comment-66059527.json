Make.ccmd is for the C-only\ntools like the compiler.\n\nHowever, Make.cmd does not know all the cgo magic that\nMake.pkg does, so right now you have to split your\ncommand into two packages.  This will get better when\nwe retire the makefiles in favor of the still-under-development\n'go' tool.  Then you'll be able to just import \"C\" in your\npackage main and it will work, no questions asked.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
