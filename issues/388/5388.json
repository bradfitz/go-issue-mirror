	"body": "by **stonkajr**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eMany people (including me) keep 'dotfiles' repositories with various useful stuff. One\nof the type of files is all the vim plugins in one place, this is very easy if you use\npathogen and subrepositories/modules.\nBut including whole go repo just to have vim syntax is a bit overkill. There are many\nunofficial attempts, like:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/uggedal/go-vim\"\u003ehttps://github.com/uggedal/go-vim\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/anzaika/go.vim\"\u003ehttps://github.com/anzaika/go.vim\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/fsouza/go.vim\"\u003ehttps://github.com/fsouza/go.vim\u003c/a\u003e\nbut they are updated (I guess) manually and can easily get out of date.\nWould you be willing to keep the vim files in separate repo and maybe link as a subrepo\nfrom main (or even not, not everyone uses vim, so maybe no need of it in main repo?)\nBest,\u003c/pre\u003e",
