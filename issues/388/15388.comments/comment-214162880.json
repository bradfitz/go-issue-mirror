This test will, probably, live in \"os\" package. The test will demonstrate the problem - so it will create async socket (or whatever other media that work similarly), then start a child process with stdin / stdout set to the socket, and then get child process read and write its stdin / stdout.\r\n\r\nThe test will, obviously, have to fail on current tip. But then we could make whatever adjustments to standard library to make that test pass.\r\n\r\nIf you want to take on that task, this https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html is how to contribute. You could put your new test in $GOROOT/src/os/os_windows_test.go, because I think you would have to use Windows APIs for the test.\r\n\r\nAlex",
