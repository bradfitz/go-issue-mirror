Proposed function would count n runes. Why ALL is good, but n is bad? I don't\nquite understand what \nkind of bad behaviour it would encourage, nor I understand where N^2 comes from. but if\nit's true, same can be \nsaid about Index. \nFor every example where N^2 materializes, similar example can be built based on Index,\nit's 1-to-1.\u003c/pre\u003e",
