The latter seems like overkill and annoying to maintain, but\nthere'd probably be someone who'd complain about the former.\n\nThen there's the problem that moving it now would break existing setups and that people\nmight not discover the editor plugins at all. Also they couldn't as easily be bundled\nwith the binary distribution if they live in a separate repository.\u003c/pre\u003e",
