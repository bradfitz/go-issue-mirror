This pointer is left on stack in 0x18(rsp).\n\np := make([]int, N_ELEMS)\nis turned into makeslice1 call. 0x18(rsp) refers to makeslice1 return value, which is a\npointer but not initialized until function returns. GC is triggered inside of makeslice1\nand it scans 0x18(rsp) completely conservatively.\n\nAs the result 160MB hashmap buffer with all the hashes is scanned conservatively.\n\nQuestions:\n1. We are going to zero function return values and local in C code as well, right?\n2. We will need to do the same for assembly functions manually, right?\u003c/pre\u003e",
