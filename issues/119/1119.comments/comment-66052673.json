This is repeated in rfc 5987.\n\nHaving said that, support for utf-8 encoding using rfc 5987 should be added. Also, if\nthere's a way in which we can correctly handle iso 8859-1 characters in the filename, it\nwould make sense to implement that as well.\n\nFor exhaustive background reading, see \u003ca href=\"http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/\"\u003ehttp://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
