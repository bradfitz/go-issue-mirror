	"body": "It would be convenient if `go tool fix` had a rule (possibly off by default?) added to upgrade imports of the context package to the new version in the standard library.\r\n\r\nHere is a CL that I'm using to upgrade my projects: https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/28872/\r\n\r\nThis makes the new rewrites list read as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAvailable rewrites are:\r\n\r\ncontext\r\n        Change imports of golang.org/x/net/context to context\r\n\r\ngotypes\r\n        Change imports of golang.org/x/tools/go/{exact,types} to go/{constant,types}\r\n\r\nnetipv6zone\r\n        Adapt element key to IPAddr, UDPAddr or TCPAddr composite literals.\r\n\r\n        https://codereview.appspot.com/6849045/\r\n\r\nprinterconfig\r\n        Add element keys to Config composite literals.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis isn't strictly the same as some of the other rewrites in the tool because the old context package is still perfectly usable, so maybe it would be best to leave this fix off by default and allow it to be manually specified.",
