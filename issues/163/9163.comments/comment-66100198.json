So, this does seem to be working in 1.4, as far as what the go runtime is\nreporting.\n\nClosing this issue then.\n\n\u003e ... However, in 1.4, what still seems odd is that Windows reports that ~13.5 is still\n\"in use\" ...\n\nThe way runtime works is not straight froward (and changing all the time) - there are\nmany factors involved. Runtime creates its own structures. You can investigate\neverything yourself. windows memory interface lives in\n%GOROOT%\\src\\runtime\\mem_windows.go. You could put printf statements there to see what\nhappens in your program. If you get stuck or need some explaining - everyone here (or on\ngo-nuts) will help.\n\nYou should use vmmap program to measure Windows memory usage. Task Manager provides very\nlittle details.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Retracted**._",
