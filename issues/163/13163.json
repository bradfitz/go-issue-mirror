	"body": "I'm building a fairly large library for ios which is working great. Its about 20MB for each architecture. \r\n\r\nHowever, the build times are really starting to take their toll. They are now taking around 5 minutes to build which is tough for productivity. It would be great to be able to speed up these time by perhaps caching some of the build data. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure of the process but it seems for every build, bind generates a new random temporary folder for all the files, where perhaps, it could use a cached folder and reuse previously built object files?",
