The request is fine but if vet complains\ntoo often incorrectly, the check is not valuable.\n\nIf it is a method, whether internal or exported, it might satisfy some interface and\nthere's no practical way to know which one because interfaces are not bound to the\npackage.\n\nfunc (t or T) Read(p buf) (int, error) { return 0, io.EOF }\n\nsatisfies io.Reader, which means the parameter cannot be removed. Plus it might make\nperfect sense to document that p is unused. Thus complaining about unused parameters to\nmethods will generate too many false positives.\n\nThe check cannot be made to work reliably for methods. What about functions?\n\nIf it is an exported function, there could be many reasons that the parameter exists but\nis unused; for instance, it might be historical but now irrelevant. Again, too many\nfalse positives.\n\nIf it is an internal function, we could provide this test usefully, I believe, but there\nare very few such things, on average, plus the question explicitly asked about methods,\nnot functions.\n\nWe therefore conclude that vet cannot provide a low-enough noise signal for enough cases\nto make this worthwhile.\n\nMarking this WontFix.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
