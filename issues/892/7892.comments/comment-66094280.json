Consider\n\ntype Fooer interface {\n        Foo()\n        CloseTempFile(AndRemoveIt bool)\n}\n\nAn all memory implementation of Fooer has no use of the AndRemoveIt argument.\n\nNow consider that also plain functions can be used in the same, or almost the same way\nas interface implementing types. Either passed as a callback or converted to an\ninterface type (like http.HandlerFunc) and then again, unused arguments might be\nperfectly legitimate.\n\nIOW, making unused args, even when only for exported function, a compile error is IMO\nnot an option.\u003c/pre\u003e",
