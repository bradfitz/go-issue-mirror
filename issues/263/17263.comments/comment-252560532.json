Let's Encrypt (and the spec, for that matter, it seems) supports only port 443 for `tls-sni-x` challenges, which is what autocert uses.\r\n\r\nYou'd have to obtain the certs in some other way (use `dns-01` with acme.Client or run autocert on another host listening on port 443) and then pass it to your server running on 60667.\r\n\r\nSee https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/letsencrypt-doesnt-work-for-different-ports/17519 and https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/support-for-ports-other-than-80-and-443/3419\r\n\r\n@bradfitz I think this issue can be closed now.",
