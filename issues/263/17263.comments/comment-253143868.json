Step 2 of the described verification procedure says “Open a TLS connection to the domain name being validated on the **requested port**”.\r\n\r\nSo, is this a Let’s Encrypt limitation or an ACME limitation? If the latter, I think we should update the spec to clearly state that (and its intention). If the former, we should file a tracking bug at LetsEncrypt to lift that limitation.\r\n\r\n\u003e You'd have to obtain the certs in some other way (use dns-01 with acme.Client or run autocert on another host listening on port 443) and then pass it to your server running on 60667.\r\n\r\nIs there by any chance a code example explaining how to use the `dns-01` challenge with acme.Client?",
