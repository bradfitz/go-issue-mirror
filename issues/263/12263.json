	"body": "This broke because the cgo-based lookup did accept \"123\" but the Go-based lookup does not. This means the behavior was at best inconsistent before, but it does make sense that you should be able to look up tcp/80 in addition to tcp/http.\n\nIf we have a more serious problem for a 1.5.1 this would be a candidate for an add-on.",
