The SizeReaderAt will require to:\n\n1. Add the SizeReaderAt interface to io\n2. Make sure that all the types with ReaderAt have the Size method. It should probably\nrather be LenReaderAt because bytes.Reader and strings.Reader have it already. However,\nit's missing in os.File and would have to be added.\n\nOf course (2) could be skipped but then it requires that the user has to implement it\nand that's something which doesn't feel \"right\" - the thing I love about go is how\nthings can be combined out of the box.\n\nThis doesn't mean I don't find it a good idea - I think it would be useful to have some\nstandard interface defining the name of the length-returning method.\n\nLenner, yuck.\u003c/pre\u003e",
