This is a common mistake made by\nGo developers, and it is detecting that situation.\n\nYou can work around this by deleting lib/codereview/codereview.cfg from your\nlocal copy of the Go repository or by moving the codereview extension\ninto per-repository .hg/hgrc files instead of your ~/.hgrc.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
