This is\ngoing to need investigation by somebody who knows more C++ on Darwin.\n\nAlthough I don't see any evidence of this in the GCC source code, it's possible that\nyour g++ only works correctly if the main function is compiled by g++.  One way to test\nthis would be to add a call to __main() in your MyPrint function before referring to\nstd::cout.  (If that fails to link with an undefined reference to __main, then that is\nnot the problem, but I have no other idea what the problem might be.)\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-macosx**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **HelpWanted**._",
