By specifying the ports in LocalAddr you can indeed\nbypass the kernel problem. The actual problem in my code was 'solved' by removing a go\nchannel that was counting the number of cross routine completed connections,\nunfortunately connections where completing faster than the channel could process them.\nIncreasing the channel buffer was only delaying the problem.\n\nWhile you still have to take care of the \"address already in use\" error as it will\nhappen sometime when you select a port that is used by a tcp session outside the go\nprogram.\n\nWith the code from the first post in this issue you can make millions of concurrent tcp\nconnections with golang.\u003c/pre\u003e",
