Could this lead to many additional threads being created when you perform certain kind of operations (especially blocking operations other than sleeping or socket I/O).  Do you do any file I/O?\r\n\r\nWhat's the output of `ulimit -a`?  Can you compare the output of `ps -eLf` with Go 1.4.2 and Go 1.5 to see how many threads there are for your application's PID before/after?",
