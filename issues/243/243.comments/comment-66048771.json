It turns local failures into global ones -- not a good\ndesign for systems programming or servers. And, without some sort of hook to be\ncalled upon failure, it provides no recourse at all, and leads to designers avoiding\nlarge caches, sparse arrays, and other address-space intensive techniques. This is\nnot the sort of decision that language designers should make for their users, not if\nthey want their language to be taken seriously for systems programming.\u003c/pre\u003e",
