But I came across a similar situation to #6 today, where I'm talking to a\n3rd-party server, that's sending me a cookie containing backslashes.\nSo what would you recommend doing in this case, as I suppose there's good reasons for\ndisallowing backslashes, double-quotes, etc. from cookies by default? Is there a better\nway than just extracting/duplicating all the relevant code from net/http?\u003c/pre\u003e",
