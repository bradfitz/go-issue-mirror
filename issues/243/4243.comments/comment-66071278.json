During the GC another goroutine wants to\ntrigger GC (or read mem stats) as well and blocks on the stoptheworld sema (goroutine\n16). Meanwhile another goroutine blocks (goroutine 1). The goroutine 1 sees that only\nthe scavenger is running, and so it reports the deadlock; it does not expect that the\nscavenger can block/unblock other goroutines, but it is the case via the stoptheworld\nsema.\n\nIf it is the case, it can easily crash long-running processes.\u003c/pre\u003e",
