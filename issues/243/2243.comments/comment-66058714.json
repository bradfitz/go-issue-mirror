It does appear to return 0 all the\ntime regardless:\n\nC:\\\u003etest.bat 0 \u0026\u0026 echo \"Zero result\"\n\"Zero result\"\n\nC:\\\u003etest.bat 1 \u0026\u0026 echo \"Zero result\"\n\"Zero result\"\n\nC:\\\u003etest.bat 0 || echo \"Non-zero result\"\n\nC:\\\u003etest.bat 1 || echo \"Non-zero result\"\n\nC:\\\u003e\n\nIt looks to me that cmd.exe always see 0 exit code. That is what current os.StartProcess\ndoes. Isn't it?\n\nI think there are too many \"tricky\" things to make it work simple and clear. I think\npeople should avoid using batch files when they can. If you can't avoid batch file, then\nyou still have an option to use os.StartProcess with appropriate parameters, but then at\nleast you supposed to know what you are doing.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
