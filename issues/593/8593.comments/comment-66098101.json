It means not calling functions and not accessing any heap/global\nmemory.\n\n\u003e another strange thing is that the test mostly flake on freebsd, but not\nlinux/darwin/windows.\n\nThis can be due to the way I built the runtime. I did not manage to build a fresh\ngcc/clang on freebsd, so I used some old default one. So the runtime can be slower on\nfreebsd.\u003c/pre\u003e",
