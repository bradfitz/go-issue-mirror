Nothing was said regarding internal-only\nrace.IsEnabled, we can use it judiciously.\n\n\u003e why profiling tests flake with race detector enabled? they are supposed to be\nindependent.\n\nThe test is bad, it assumes that most of the CPU cycles will be in a particular\nfunction. While race and cpuprof are independent, the test assumption breaks under race\ndetector. I guess most samples go into race runtime.\u003c/pre\u003e",
