	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.6.3\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/home/tyho/go\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/usr/lib/golang\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/usr/lib/golang/pkg/tool/linux_amd64\"\r\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\"1\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you expect to see?\r\nrand.Reader to consistently internally buffer, or not internally buffer calls to Read regardless of platform.\r\n\r\n4. What did you see instead?\r\nOn generic Unix, including old versions of Linux (without a getrandom syscall), rand.Reader reads from /dev/urandom, and buffers calls to Read using the bufio package. On modern Linux however, rand.Read requests are implemented using the new getrandom syscall, but the calls are not buffered.\r\n\r\n5. What did you do?\r\nI tested to see if internally buffering output on platforms with the getrandom syscall available would make a significant difference to the performance of small 16B reads:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/80fyLlBFQb\r\n\r\nOn my machine, internally buffering the output of Read doubled performance compared with raw Reads. Tv` suggested that the unbuffered Reads may be quicker when multithreaded due to bufio adding a mutex. He wrote a benchmark to test this theory but it turned out not to be true:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/3sO47iNhK5",
