	"body": "by **hongruiqi**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIn linux, fsuid/fsgid is set per thread, and go may schedule different goroutines in the\nsame os thread. \n1. When a goroutine calls setfsuid, the fsuid is set in its' thread. And other\ngoroutines scheduled in the same thread may misusing the fsuid.\n2. When the origin goroutine is scheduled to another thread, the fsuid set by it is\nmissing.\n3. If other goroutine also calls setfsuid, it's much more messy.\n\nSince go has its' own scheduler, using of setfsuid isn't intuitive. And potentially\ncausing secure problem. Should it be removed from syscall?\u003c/pre\u003e",
