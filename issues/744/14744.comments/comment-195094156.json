	"body": "So it looks like you just got lucky for 1.6 (and earlier).  The old compiler spills, e.g., a2, then reloads it and stores it to a temporary, and then calls convT2E on that temporary.  If it doesn't need to spill for whatever reason, you won't get source names in the dwarf info.\r\n\r\nHere's an example where spills don't happen, and thus the compiler loses names for all Go versions I tested (1.5.1, 1.6, tip):\r\n```\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\ta := 6\r\n\tb := 7\r\n\tfmt.Printf(\"%d %d\\n\", a, b)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFixing this in SSA will be difficult, as the frontend has already introduced the nameless temporary for the convT2E call.\r\nStill worth fixing if we can, but I don't see any easy fixes.",
