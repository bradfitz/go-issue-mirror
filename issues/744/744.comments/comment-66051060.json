On the browser side, people use e.g. jQuery AJAX, which\nautomatically reads the JSON response and converts it to JavaScript struct without\ninterfering\nwith the case.\nAnd so the awkward thing is you start with a Go struct like\ntype S struct { int A }\nand you end up with a JavaScript struct\ntype S struct { int a }.\u003c/pre\u003e",
