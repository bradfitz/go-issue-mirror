	"body": "by **Jens.Alfke**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI have a very short program that seems to cause something to break in the\nplay.golang.org runner, causing the web UI to output \u0026quot;Error communicating with\nremote server\u0026quot; instead of the expected output.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Run \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/DGwJxtT2BR\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/DGwJxtT2BR\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nIt should output the line \u0026quot;EXIT\u0026quot; followed by a panic report (due to the nil\npointer access.)\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\u0026quot;Error communicating with remote server.\u0026quot;\n\nNotes:\n* If you comment out the \u0026quot;defer\u0026quot; call in the function, it will behave as\nexpected; so it's some kind of problem running the deferred code while handling a panic.\n* A simpler nil-pointer dereference does _not_ trigger this problem; it has something to\ndo with the Timer.Stop method.\u003c/pre\u003e",
