	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIn the following program:\n\npackage main\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar a float64\n\tvar s string\n\ts[0] = a\n}\n\nThe program reports:\nprog.go:6: cannot assign to s[0]\nprog.go:6: cannot use a (type float64) as type uint8 in assignment\n\nThere are two issues here. First, there are two errors when there could be one. This is\nrelated to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/6406\"\u003eissue #6406\u003c/a\u003e. Second, the type mismatch is stated as float64 vs uint8, but it\nshould be float64 vs. byte. I'm not sure if these two issues are related, so I'm filing\nthem as one issue, but I can file a second issue if they are distinct.\u003c/pre\u003e",
