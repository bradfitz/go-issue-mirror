The only difference seems to be that there is an error returned.\n\nUpon checking the status of the returned error I would note that something went wrong\nand act accordingly when in fact there was nothing wrong other than that the\nunmarshalling noted a null string and decided not to set that struct element value.\n\nI may have missed something crucial in the code but to me it seems at least wrong to\nreturn an error in this case although I agree that null is not a string.\n\nHenrik\u003c/pre\u003e",
