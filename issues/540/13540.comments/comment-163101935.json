It's only in some edge cases that it doesn't work.\r\n\r\n\u003e That would mean that net/http.Client doesn't have to change except to use the channel. \r\n\r\nSo you're okay with Client using the channel? That means temporarily mutating \u0026 restoring the field on the Request because a Client uses a RoundTripper (e.g. Transport) (or potentially N RoundTripper composed deep) and passes down a Request (which has a Cancel). The Cancel (read: \"context\") is not a separate argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
