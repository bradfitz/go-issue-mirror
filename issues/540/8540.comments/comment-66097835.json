I don't know if this is true in general. \n\nNo such luck.  RFC 1035 leaves it up to the application, and although DKIM, DMARC, IKE,\nand SPF specify that the constituent strings of their TXT record should be concatenated,\nDNS-SD specifies a different interpretation for its TXT record (RFC 6763 §6.3):\n\n“Each key/value pair is encoded as its own constituent string within the DNS TXT\nrecord, in the form \"key=value\" (without the quotation marks).”\n\nSo for the general case, we do need a [][]string.\u003c/pre\u003e",
