	"body": "@stevekuznetsov I believe the \"#27640,#27764\" means that the block begins at byte 27640 in the file and ends at byte 27764. So something like \"head -c 27764 request.go | tail -c +27640\" should print the block it's talking about.\r\n\r\nCan you try again with Go 1.7rc3? It's possible that this has already been fixed since 1.6.2. Thanks!",
