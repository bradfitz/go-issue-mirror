	"body": "To remove a key from the keyring, `keyring.Remove` copies the last key in the slice to the position at which the key was found. The keys can then be sliced to exclude the last key.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, `keyring.Remove` performed the slice incorrectly and removed all but the last key.\r\n\r\nThis causes the `keyring.Remove` method to only function properly if there are exactly two keys in the keyring and the key to be removed is the first key. If there are more than two keys in the keyring, multiple (non-matching) keys are removed. If the key to be removed is the last key, the method never returns.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nr.keys = r.keys[len(r.keys)-1:]\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould be:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nr.keys = r.keys[:len(r.keys)-1]\r\n```",
