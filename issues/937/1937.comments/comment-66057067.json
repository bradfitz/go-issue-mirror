Your program is not compiling,\nso fmt.Printf is not being run (it is just a function like any other\nfunction you might call in a program).\n\nConstants in Go can be quite large, but when used in a\nprogram (such as in a function call) they must be given\na type, and they must fit in that type.  If the function takes\na value of a given type then that type is used.\nIf there is no type available, then int is assumed for\nconstants without decimal points or exponents, and\nthat constant doesn't fit in an int (it doesn't even\nfit in an int64) so the compiler is telling you it cannot\ncompile the code, instead of silently miscompiling it.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
