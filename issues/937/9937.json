I would like to use go generate rather than have additional\r\n\u003e instructions about which script in the directory was used to create the\r\n\u003e example.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e It would be nice to be able to `go generate -tags sometag` to only\r\n\u003e generate the examples, however it seems that in the absence of a\r\n\u003e specific file target go generate parses the entire directory without\r\n\u003e examining tags.\r\n\r\nSee discussion at https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/uQy1hppWsZE/discussion",
