It is a feature in the Google flags module for [C++](http://gflags.github.io/gflags/#special) and  [Python](https://github.com/gflags/python-gflags/blob/master/gflags.py). When I was a Google SRE, we made use of this feature frequently.  I was surprised to find it missing from the Golang flags module.  I've been out of Google for 3 years, so I don't know if Google has a different golang flag module that is used internally or what, but it seems like a useful operational feature.",
