	"body": "I'm also not in favor of this proposal. It only begs for more features: flags read from a file before and others, flags read from a file during. It opens new questions: what happens when a flag is set from a file and from the command-line - should a user be warned because it's not necessarily visible, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nBut there's also a secondary effect, a meta-issue, if you will: Once it's possible to read from a flag file, applications will start using that feature (flag file for configurations, etc.). It's going to make those applications more complicated. It will lead to a proliferation of flags (hey, just consume the 100-line flag file!).\r\n\r\nI think there's a fine balance between providing basic flag support (which is what we have now), and opening the door to \"flags processing\". Go apps that need the latter might want to use a custom solution or external package. Most Go apps won't need such a mechanism and shouldn't be encouraged to go in that direction.\r\n\r\nAs a former Googler, @tlimoncelli, you know what \"flag proliferation\" means at Google scale... :-) I don't think we want to go there.\r\n\r\ncc: @robpike ",
