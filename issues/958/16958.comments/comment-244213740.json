The oldest version I saw the same issue with was 1.5. \r\n\r\nAs for the documentation for closeNotifier, i'm not sure what you're referring to.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding of the documentation if you set req.Close=true either on the client side or the server side (for response) you will kill the tcp connection after a single request-response pair, which is the same as not using keep-alive connections at all since you will need to reestablish tcp for the next request. This issue is specifically a problem when using keep-alive connections.",
