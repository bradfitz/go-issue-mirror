	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eRFC6455 has a ping/pong function that allows the server to discover if the client isn't\nresponding. The go.net/websocket library will respond to pings, but cannot send them or\ndo anything with pongs.\n\nWhat I'd like to see is some sort of PingInterval / PongTimeout value that causes pings\nto be sent on a timer, and then timeout the connection if a pong hasn't been received.\n\nPerhaps this can be done in the Read function, or done in a go routine. It would likely\nhave to use SetReadDeadline, but I'm not sure how that would work with the existing\nexported function.\u003c/pre\u003e",
