If we can preempt at the first write barrier, then even if we let the mutator run it can't modify anything that the GC cares about.  So maybe we just set the write barrier enabled bit and let goroutines run.  Once a goroutine sees the write barrier bit (how do we force that?) it can't modify any memory the GC cares about.  So it is safe to start the GC without waiting for every goroutine to stop.",
