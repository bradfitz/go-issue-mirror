	"body": "It seems to me that we can preempt at a write barrier.  So the only loops we are talking about are those that make no writes to the heap and make no function calls.   If we think in terms of adding\r\n\r\n```\r\n    uint8 b\r\n  loop:\r\n    ++b\r\n    if b == 0 {\r\n        preemptCheck()\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the normal path through the loop will have two extra instructions (add/beq) where the add may be to either a register or a memory location, depending on overall register pressure.  This will be measurable in tight loops but for most cases shouldn't be too bad.",
