	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe code.google.com/p/go.tools/imports package has logic for enumerating Go packages in\nones GOPATH workspace that deviates from that of go tool and\ncode.google.com/p/go.tools/go/buildutil. See:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/imports/fix.go?repo=tools#246\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/imports/fix.go?repo=tools#246\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIt deviates in following ways:\n\n- It doesn't skip folders that begin with '_'. It makes goimports pick up vendored Go\npackages inside \u0026quot;_workspace\u0026quot; or similar folders. (If I'm not mistaken, that's\nnot intended behavior.)\n- It doesn't skip folders named \u0026quot;testdata\u0026quot;. This could cause problems\ndepending on contents of that folder.\n- It skips folders that begin with a digit from 0 to 9. The go tool (and other places,\nsuch as buildutil) does not.\n\nIt should use the same logic as the go tool when deciding if a given folder tree should\nbe explored for possible Go packages. If it makes sense, it could reuse the\nfunctionality of buildutil.ForEachPackage or buildutil.AllPackages to iterate the list\nof Go packages.\u003c/pre\u003e",
