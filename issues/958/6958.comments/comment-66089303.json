There really should be a top level INSTALL\nfile that states this very explicitly.  But think about how a deb works... you build a\ntree in a jail, get it all set up, then you make a snapshot of that, then you install\nthat.  So it really is an important concept for many of us.\n\nAs for python, surprise undeclared dependencies cause undeclared later surprise suckage.\n :(  \n\nDependencies (even if rarely used) should be stated right up front and let us, who know\nour systems, set (and test) these things so that they might have a chance of working.\u003c/pre\u003e",
