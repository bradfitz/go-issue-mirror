I was excited for go in my\nGoogle I/O demo with Francesc and others, but I'm not thrilled about this kind of\npackaging or response to serious requests to make things work well.\n\nI can not use godeb.  This is the fink packaging system that uses apt-get, but is NOT\ndebian.  Go is seriously frustrating to someone like me not because of the language, but\nbecause the build system and documentation is totally odd ball.  That's okay, but you\nhave to acknowledge that other people have other ways of doing things.  If you dismiss\nthat, you dismiss those people from wanting to check out the language.\n\nThanks for pushing every one who uses the fink packager manager away from go.  I was\njust trying to address real issues in the build system for go.  If you don't listen to\npeople who are actually reading your documentation \u0026 code and inspecting binaries, then\nthat's a serious downer.\u003c/pre\u003e",
