I need help from the go team to understand how go\nexpects to build its world.\n\nThis is most definitely a go team question.  Please reopen this question and read\nthrough my report.\n\nI'm trying to make go work properly in our fink environment.  I want to figure out why\ngo is trying to write into the go tree when a user (which happens to be me) tries to do\nhello world.    I believe we have either setup go incorrectly or go is doing the wrong\nthing.\n\n- So we just use the go build system and expect the tree that it builds to work (which\nit doesn't).\n- I don't see why it is okay for go to ever jump into its own tree and start changing\nthings (outside of the initial build / install process).  I would argue that go should\nbe throwing an error saying that the timestamp is bad in its package and that its env is\nbad rather than the errors that I see.\n- Looking at \u003ca href=\"https://launchpad.net/godeb\"\u003ehttps://launchpad.net/godeb\u003c/a\u003e, I have no idea what you are referring me to. \nor \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/mkrautz/godeb\"\u003ehttps://github.com/mkrautz/godeb\u003c/a\u003e makes no sense to me either.  Can you be a little\nmore explicit?\n\nSorry if I'm missing something obvious, but go is not behaving like a typical package.\u003c/pre\u003e",
