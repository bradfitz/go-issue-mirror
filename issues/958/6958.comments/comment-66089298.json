(you can search the issue tracker for past issues like this)\n\nas explained in #1, if you keep the relative timestamps right, Go won't ever try to\nwrite to $GOROOT/pkg. Please double-check the timestamp, esp. pay attentions\nto symlinks. (You can try install the official binary distribution and see if you\ncan reproduce the bug.)\n\nby godeb, i'm referring to the one on launchpad that translates official go release\ntarballs on the fly to deb package for installation.\n\nNo, Go is not a typical package, because it's a self-contained programming\nenvironment.\u003c/pre\u003e",
