If you're not using godeb then\nyou're just duplicating work that somebody else has already done. In general, it is a\ngood idea to get someone who knows Go to package Go. Godeb was written by someone who\nknows Go. Please use godeb if possible.\n\nThe installation instructions for Go are very clear. README points to those source\ninstall docs. The README file is 32 lines long, and theÂ second paragraph (after a one\nline paragraph) explains how to find the install docs. Is that really so difficult?\u003c/pre\u003e",
