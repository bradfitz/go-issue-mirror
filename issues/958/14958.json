	"body": "Add the ability to specify a file of flags to be read as if they appeared on the command line.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat foo.flags\r\nflagb=fromfoo\r\nflagc=1\r\n$ democommand -flagb=foo -flagfile=foo.flags -flagc=bar\r\nflagb is set to \"fromfoo\"\r\nflagc is set to \"bar\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor backwards compatibility, -flagfile would step out of the way if a flag by that name was defined (similar to -help).\r\n\r\nWe also have the need to be able to specify a flagfile that is read before any other arg processing. We propose flag.DefaultsFromFiles(\"filename.txt\") set a flagfile that is ready before any other args, as if \"-flagfile=filename.txt\" was specified first on the command line.\r\n\r\nA draft implementation can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/tlimoncelli/go/compare/tlim_betterflag",
