It is possible to get it right for numbers, but not for boolean constants true and false.\r\n\r\nYou can see the hackiness in setlineno around line 230 of subr.go; that uses the line number of a node to set the global lineno (a hack in itself if you ask me) but only when the node is not a ONAME, OTYPE, OPACK, or OLITERAL.",
