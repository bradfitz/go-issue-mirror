(run 'go version')\n\ntip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nDmitry helped me debug this. Recvmsg needs:\n\n  if rsa.Addr.Family != AF_UNSPEC {\n  from, err = anyToSockaddr(\u0026amp;rsa)\n  }\n+ if raceenabled \u0026amp;\u0026amp; err == nil {\n+ raceAcquire(unsafe.Pointer(\u0026amp;ioSync))\n+ }\n\nSendmsg needs:\n\n  msg.Iov = \u0026amp;iov\n  msg.Iovlen = 1\n+ if raceenabled {\n+ raceReleaseMerge(unsafe.Pointer(\u0026amp;ioSync))\n+ }\n\nDmitry suggested that this is for after Go 1.1. Since it's a small fix, it would be nice\nto do it before, but we can wait.\u003c/pre\u003e",
