There are differences in the interpretation of certain\nthings between Windows and POSIX-like platforms (example: expansion of the tilde to mean\n$HOME), and I would not want Go programs to use different rules for the expansion than\neverything else.\n\nThat said, the most urgent need for a Glob function is on Windows for decoding file name\narguments, thus the Win32-only function should be fine.\u003c/pre\u003e",
