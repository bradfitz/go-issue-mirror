All the tests pass even when ran behind a firewall.\n\nBut now the net pkg tests fail behind a firewall. Probably because some test was added\nthere. I supposed these tests will never work behind a firewall...\n\nHere is the output of the build after it fails:\n\ngopack grc _test/net.a _gotest_.8 \nmake[2]: Leaving directory `/home/nsousa/Projects/google-go/src/pkg/net'\n--- FAIL: net.TestDialGoogle (5683.3 seconds)\n        -- 72.14.204.104:80 --\n        Dial(\"tcp\", \"\", \"72.14.204.104:80\") = _, dial tcp 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp4\", \"\", \"72.14.204.104:80\") = _, dial tcp4 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp4\", \"\", \"72.14.204.104:80\") = _, dial tcp4 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp6\", \"\", \"72.14.204.104:80\") = _, dial tcp6 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        -- www.google.com:80 --\n        Dial(\"tcp\", \"\", \"www.google.com:80\") = _, dial tcp 72.14.204.99:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp4\", \"\", \"www.google.com:80\") = _, dial tcp4 72.14.204.103:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp4\", \"\", \"www.google.com:80\") = _, dial tcp4 72.14.204.147:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp6\", \"\", \"www.google.com:80\") = _, dial tcp6 72.14.204.99:80: connection timed out\n        -- 72.14.204.104:http --\n        Dial(\"tcp\", \"\", \"72.14.204.104:http\") = _, dial tcp 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp4\", \"\", \"72.14.204.104:http\") = _, dial tcp4 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp4\", \"\", \"72.14.204.104:http\") = _, dial tcp4 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp6\", \"\", \"72.14.204.104:http\") = _, dial tcp6 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        -- www.google.com:http --\n        Dial(\"tcp\", \"\", \"www.google.com:http\") = _, dial tcp 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp4\", \"\", \"www.google.com:http\") = _, dial tcp4 74.125.225.19:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp4\", \"\", \"www.google.com:http\") = _, dial tcp4 72.14.204.99:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp6\", \"\", \"www.google.com:http\") = _, dial tcp6 74.125.225.16:80: connection timed out\n        -- 072.014.204.104:0080 --\n        Dial(\"tcp\", \"\", \"072.014.204.104:0080\") = _, dial tcp 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp4\", \"\", \"072.014.204.104:0080\") = _, dial tcp4 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp4\", \"\", \"072.014.204.104:0080\") = _, dial tcp4 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp6\", \"\", \"072.014.204.104:0080\") = _, dial tcp6 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        -- [::ffff:72.14.204.104]:80 --\n        Dial(\"tcp\", \"\", \"[::ffff:72.14.204.104]:80\") = _, dial tcp 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp6\", \"\", \"[::ffff:72.14.204.104]:80\") = _, dial tcp6 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        -- [::ffff:480e:cc68]:80 --\n        Dial(\"tcp\", \"\", \"[::ffff:480e:cc68]:80\") = _, dial tcp 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp6\", \"\", \"[::ffff:480e:cc68]:80\") = _, dial tcp6 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        -- [0:0:0:0:0000:ffff:72.14.204.104]:80 --\n        Dial(\"tcp\", \"\", \"[0:0:0:0:0000:ffff:72.14.204.104]:80\") = _, dial tcp 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp6\", \"\", \"[0:0:0:0:0000:ffff:72.14.204.104]:80\") = _, dial tcp6 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        -- [0:0:0:0:000000:ffff:72.14.204.104]:80 --\n        Dial(\"tcp\", \"\", \"[0:0:0:0:000000:ffff:72.14.204.104]:80\") = _, dial tcp 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp6\", \"\", \"[0:0:0:0:000000:ffff:72.14.204.104]:80\") = _, dial tcp6 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        -- [0:0:0:0:0:ffff::72.14.204.104]:80 --\n        Dial(\"tcp\", \"\", \"[0:0:0:0:0:ffff::72.14.204.104]:80\") = _, dial tcp 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\n        Dial(\"tcp6\", \"\", \"[0:0:0:0:0:ffff::72.14.204.104]:80\") = _, dial tcp6 72.14.204.104:80: connection timed out\nFAIL\nmake[1]: *** [test] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/nsousa/Projects/google-go/src/pkg/net'\nmake: *** [net.test] Error 2\u003c/pre\u003e",
