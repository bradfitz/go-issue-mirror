However, given the length of this thread and the unlikelihood that anybody's read it all, I think it's time to freeze this thread until it's time for any next step, which won't be at least 4-6 months probably.\r\n\r\nThe plan at this point is just to implement more in `x/crypto/acme` and `x/crypto/acme/autocert` and add more documentation+examples to `net/http` for Go 1.8.\r\n",
