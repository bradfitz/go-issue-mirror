	"body": "At some point the official communication was discouraging using go to terminate your TLS connections as go's tls implementation wasn't well-vetted and instead use a reverse proxy or link in OpenSSL. Are we now straying from that recommendation?\r\nIn a similar vein, I'd consider it more or less bad practice to read/write to disk in a frontend binary, as it limits scalability. So, instead of making it possible to change the directory of the on-disk cache, I'd prefer overwriting the caching-mechanism altogether (still defaulting to an automatic on-disk cache, if you want).\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think acme lives in `x/crypto` quite fine. I don't really see a reason to increase the API surface of the stdlib for this. If anything, I'd at least wait O(years) to see how the protocol and it's adoption develops.",
