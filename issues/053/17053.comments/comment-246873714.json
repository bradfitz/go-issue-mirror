Perhaps that has changed since then. I'd certain like to\r\nhear what's @agl's current position.\r\n\r\nIf Go's TLS implementation still hasn't been critically reviewed from a security\r\nstandpoint, perhaps the Go team should dedicate some resources to fix\r\nthe issue as Go is very popular these days and relying on OpenSSL to\r\nterminate TLS is silly for a safe programming language with native TLS support.\r\n",
