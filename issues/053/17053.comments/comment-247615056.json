Eg, if you are running a binary that compiles this code in on many servers (either your actual app or a custom proxy) which do not share a disk you likely do not want them all to individually and separately talk to LetsEncrypt as that will quickly exhaust your rate limits.\r\n\r\n(Otherwise +1 on this general idea. We are a production user of github.com/hlandau/acme but hopefully this library provides similar support, or we can just keep using hlandau.)\r\n\r\n",
