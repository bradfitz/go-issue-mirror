It looks like the ssh package relies on some parts of the\nnet.Conn contract which are not specified in the interface, namely that anything\nimplementing net.Conn has to support concurrent Read/Write and Close actions. When we\nreplace a real socket with a net.Conn mock implementation, if those contracts are not\npresent, we get a data race.\u003c/pre\u003e",
