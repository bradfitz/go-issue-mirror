It's a problem in the tests. transport expects a proper net.Conn\nand the mock one is a bit less than that.\n\nHere's an idea for doing it with a UNIX socket pair:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/8402046\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/8402046\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThere's still a bug in it that I need to chase down.\n\nAny love for this approach?\u003c/pre\u003e",
