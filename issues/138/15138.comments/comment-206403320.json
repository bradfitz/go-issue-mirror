	"body": "The android/arm64 ones are all in TestStackBarrierProfiling, which uses a funny debug mode that may simply be broken on arm64 (it's definitely broken on ppc64). \r\n\r\nThe darwin/arm64 ones are more concerning. It looks like the stack barrier list is just wrong (e.g., `[@@@ ==\u003e *0xd=0x0]` in the last one). That's a bad pointer *and* a bad value. The \"missed stack barrier\" panic is almost certainly just a symptom of the earlier nil-pointer dereference in gcRemoveStackBarrier, but I'm not sure where the bad barrier pointers came from in the first place.\r\n\r\nIs this builder a multicore ARM64 or single core? If it's multicore, this could be a weak memory order issue.",
