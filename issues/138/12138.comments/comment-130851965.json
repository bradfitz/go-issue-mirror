(I ask because ARM made a mess of its concurrency primitives, so it's basically impossible to run a multithreaded binary compiled for ARM v5 correctly on ARM v7 hardware.)\r\n\r\n\u003e I'll see if I can start running it with GODEBUG=gccheckmark=1. Is there anything in particular I should be observing with that flag?\r\n\r\nPanics. :) This enables an assertion in the runtime, so if it fails, it will panic with a bunch of debugging info.",
