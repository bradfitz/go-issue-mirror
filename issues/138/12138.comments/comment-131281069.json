You're storing a\npointer to an object allocated on the Go heap in an object allocated on the\nC heap. If you're going to do that, you must keep a reference to that\nobject from the Go heap for at least as long as it's accessible from C.\nOtherwise there's simply no way the garbage collector can know it needs to\nkeep that object around. In general, it's much better to not do this at all\nand to allocate any such pointers from the C heap.\n\nAlso, there's nothing wrong with storing a pointer to the C heap in a Go\nobject. In fact, you're still doing exactly that, you're just storing a\npointer to a pointer now.\n",
