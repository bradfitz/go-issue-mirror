As soon as you leave that scope, the backing store of buf will be reachable only through the C heap (via the z_stream_s object malloc'd by inflateInit). Since the GC can't trace through the C heap, it's free to free buf. At that point all bets are off. I'm actually kind of surprised this works in 1.4.2. I think you're just getting lucky.\r\n\r\nDepending on where p comes from, the same may be true of\r\n\r\n\u003e r.s.next_out = (*C.Bytef)(unsafe.Pointer(\u0026out[0]))",
