	"body": "Following the lead of #13058 towards smaller, more focused, sub repositories, I would like to propose the creation of a sub repo for packages related to handling the interaction with tty like things. This includes\r\n\r\n* posix ttys and ptys\r\n* serial termios control, like terminals and rs232 devices.\r\n* windows cmd console\r\n\r\nMuch of the code for this exists in various packages, some in other sub repos like x/crypto/ssh/terminal, others has been duplicated incompletely by package authors with a specific use case; most times without a comprehensive story for windows.\r\n\r\nVarious informal proposal have been made, like #12853, relating to posix termios.\r\n\r\nOther proposals like #12101 for the creation of an x/sys/terminal group of packages have been rejected on the grounds that sys is too low level, which also dovetails into the desire for more smaller sub repos, rather than larger ones.\r\n\r\nThere is also the the long standing question of why the code to disable terminal echo lives in the x/crypto/ssh package.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the _name_ of the repository, which I'm sure will require debate, is there general support for a sub repository along the lines outlined in this proposal ?\r\n",
