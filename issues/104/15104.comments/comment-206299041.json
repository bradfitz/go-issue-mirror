	"body": "I had a followup to cl/21457 that introduces a new type printer for the type.* symbol names. It takes the type with placeholders for the package names and runs it through SHA-1, then prints the first few bytes of the hash (like we do with git commits). It then appends all the package names that appear in the type in appearance order.\r\n\r\nThe result is consistently small types and slightly less IO during compilation. (My secondary motivation was a stopgap measure for shrinking the symbol table for -buildmode=shared, but I now have a much simpler hack for that I'm going to send later today.) Unfortunately it also makes the toolchain just a little harder to debug. Given it's already pretty hard to understand and debug, I don't think it's worth it.\r\n\r\nSo I'd rather just land cl/21457 and make the linker's object reader handle long symbol names. I'll send another CL for that in a bit.",
