But which exactly?\nProbably all, because they all can trigger thread creation. It all needs to be rethought\nand probably even renamed.\n\nProbably now it's better to just remove it.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/6104/2/threadcreate.txt\"\u003ethreadcreate.txt\u003c/a\u003e (5407 bytes)",
