The other one being cache coherency and off by one errors.\r\n\r\nThat said, I am aware of this sort of discussion going on for at least 3 months.  I am hoping that some name can be settled on reasonably soon and that the README.md file for the new repo describes why the name was chosen, as well as what goes into the repo and why.\r\n\r\nI feel under-qualified to push for any particular suggestion.  While I don't think the perfect name has been put forward yet, I don't have any other good suggestions and the ones already mentioned aren't too offensive.",
