And quick search reveals that Linux terminals are indeed slow https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/41225/can-a-terminal-emulator-be-as-fast-as-tty-1-6\r\n\r\nAs for your \"windows console slow\" the first thing I've got is this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14295570/why-is-console-animation-so-slow-on-windows-and-is-there-a-way-to-improve-spee and there user runs \"CLS\" external process for every frame. As for https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-codereviews/hq63SCACMJo/KL97UzWeEQAJ which says `The Windows console is extreemly slow so the extra syscalls won't be noticable.` phrase, then there are two points:\r\n\r\n1. there are no any reference to this claim\r\n2. the context in which it was mentioned is that Go doesn't use WinAPI's WriteConsole which probably should be used if you want performance on Windows\r\n\r\nIf you have any idea how to measure FPS of Linux terminal vs Windows console, I'll be happy to run tests on my machine. Please also note that stdout.print() performance is not the only parameter for measuring speed - keyboard response equally matters (if not even more important).",
