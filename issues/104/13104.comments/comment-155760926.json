	"body": "My work with tcell on both Windows and UNIX is different too.   The Windows console is both more and less featureful than UNIX terminals.  And I think some confuse cmd.exe with conhost. \n\nNonetheless this proposal isn't about creating a package that can do all that a package like tcell can or his Far manager needs. Frankly for rich TUIs a bit of OS-specific work is needed for sure. For example terminfo handling is wildly different than the call to manage output attributes on Windows. \n\nWhat however this proposal is trying to achieve is to give a more portable view of adjusting some basic tty/console handling so that thinks like simply prompting for a password become a little more straight forward. Think of it as a foundation to permit a getpassphrase() implementation to be created. \n\nIt also is about providing the low level foundation so that a package like tcell or termbox can be created on top of it, in a way that allows it to run pretty much everywhere without having to hard code specific ioctls or resort to cgo to function. \n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n\u003e On Nov 11, 2015, at 2:06 AM, cznic \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e \n\u003e My perception is that Linux terminal is slow and error-prone state machine - it is not nearly as fast as Windows console, and all this multiplexing/demultiplexing is the reason.\n\u003e \n\u003e I don't think this claim is based on evidence and I believe it is important to get the facts right before adopting a decision based on them.\n\u003e \n\u003e There exist opposite experiences.
