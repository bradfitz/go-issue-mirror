I'd like to be producing and reviewing and sharing code instead of naming things.\r\n\r\nWe spend time getting names right not because we love arguing about names but because the name of something can have a very large impact on how easy it is to understand and how it will evolve.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the name has significant impact on what people will think belongs in the subrepo. It should be clear that x/term and x/os would be very different subrepos. I'm sorry about the holdup here, but of course producing and reviewing and sharing code can happen in other places too, if it's more important to move fast and break things than to get things right.",
