As far as I know that isnt available in the\nstd lib or x/sys.\n\nAlso, at a higher level there is no nice wrapper that takes parameters like\nbaud rate and converts those to their lower level windows or Unix syscalls.\n\nThis is what this proposal is, in part.\n\nThanks\n\nDave\n\nOn Wed, 11 Nov 2015, 21:24 Alex Brainman \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\n\u003e Dave,\n\u003e\n\u003e Serial port is easy: open port, change speed (and other parameters), then\n\u003e read and write bytes.
