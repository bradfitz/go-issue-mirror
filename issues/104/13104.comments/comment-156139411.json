	"body": "It sounds like this repository will contain code for (1) dealing with consoles/ttys/ptys, (2) termcap-style escape sequence generation and parsing, and (3) code for configuring serial ports. It's a bit of an odd mix, but it's certainly a common grouping historically. Is that list correct, @davecheney?\r\n\r\nBased on the discussion here and the inability to find a better name, I think x/term is fine for this set of code. If you can confirm the scope, I'll throw my hat in with x/term and then I think there is sufficient agreement to approve the proposal. Thanks for bearing with us.",
