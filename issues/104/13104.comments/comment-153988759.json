It's exported api should be agnostic, but will probably call on operating system specific packages to provide the implementation. See my GitHub.com/pkg/term package.\n\n\n\n\u003e On 5 Nov 2015, at 19:07, anatoly techtonik \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e \n\u003e Also, x/term and x/tty are already unixisms.\n\u003e \n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n\u003e \n",
