Frankly, that’s a meaty bit of work (I\nknow because it exists in my tcell package), and I don’t really think\n*that* belongs in core go.  That really feels like more of a 3rd party\npackage delivery, like tcell, to me.  (Much like GUI/widget toolkits don’t\nreally belong in core go either, I think.)\n\nOn Tue, Nov 10, 2015 at 9:16 PM, Andrew Gerrand \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e Would ANSI escape sequences *not* be in this repository?
