	"body": "Thanks Brad. I'm pretty confident that any name chosen would be wrong by\nsome measure. I think x/term would have been fine, but x/os is even better.\n\nI think this issue shows a genuine need, terminal handling, echo disabling,\nserial port handing code has been rewritten, incompletely, dozens and\ndozens of times, on an as needs basis by package authors. It would be\nunfortunate if the go project couldn't provide a solution to this very\ncommon set of problems because we couldn't agree on the perfect name for\nthe repo those packages lived in.\n\nThanks\n\nDave\n\nOn Wed, 11 Nov 2015, 08:23 Brad Fitzpatrick \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e FWIW, I find this name discussion very frustrating as well.
