	"body": "The coordinator starts the watcher in a docker container. To provide the build key to the watcher, the coordinator creates a file in /tmp/watcher.buildkey and exposes that to the docker container.\r\n\r\nFor an unknown reason, sometimes /tmp/watcher.buildkey is created as a directory instead of a file, causing the watchers to fail (they try to os.Open the directory). It's not clear to me how this is possible.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this bug is to track down that reason.\r\n\r\ncc @bradfitz ",
