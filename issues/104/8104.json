	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eliblink/obj6.c uses ctxt-\u0026gt;debugstack to emit stack underflow checks. The flag was\nmeant to be initialized from -K 6l flag.\nBut now liblink is invoked from the compiler. And the compiler does not initialize\nctxt-\u0026gt;debugstack. Moreover the compiler already uses -K flag for a different purpose.\n\nI suspect this relates to a bunch of other flags as well.\nWe need to choose some other names for the old linker flags and read them in all users\nof liblink.\u003c/pre\u003e",
