	"body": "Reasons:\r\n- getcallerpc gets called in many places; even in assembly language, a call is a call\r\n- the compiler has a pretty good idea of where it put the caller's PC.\r\n- taking the address of the first parameter reduces opportunities for optimization somewhat, though of course SSA could be smarter about noescape functions.\r\n- relying on the first parameter having an address in the caller's frame with a firm relationship to the saved return PC locks down our existing calling conventions; there are other obstacles to changing them and we might not change this part of them, but it's not a feature.",
