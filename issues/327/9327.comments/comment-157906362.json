I found this breakage after cherrypicking cl/17012, so I don't think that's related. \r\n@mwhudson Thanks for the tip. \r\n\r\nIt failed consistently in pthread_create call in _cgo_sys_thread_start (runtime/cgo/gcc_linux_386.c). But seeing it failing while calling _thread_created_hook of pthread_create (I guess it's line 380 of http://osxr.org/android/source/bionic/libc/bionic/pthread.c or equivalent), I am getting skeptical about relying on gdb. :-( ",
