	"body": "New with go-1.5: `go install \u003cbinary\u003e` for a binary using cgo seems to always rebuild the binary. I haven't been able to narrow down a test case, though I did verify that [ReadBuildIDFromBinary](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/go/pkg.go#L1794) is returning an empty string for the problematic binaries. A somewhat large test case is `github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~ go install -v github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach\r\ngithub.com/cockroachdb/cockroach\r\n~ go install -v github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach\r\ngithub.com/cockroachdb/cockroach\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect the second invocation to do nothing. `nm` reveals:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~ nm cockroach | grep buildid\r\n00000000042a0260 t go.buildid\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat symbol location is suspicious as the comments in `ReadBuildIDFromBinary` say that the symbol should be located at 0x2000. Compare this with `stringer` built with go-1.5 on the same system:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~ nm stringer | grep buildid\r\n0000000000002000 t go.buildid\r\n```",
