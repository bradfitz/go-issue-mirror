	"body": "As Andy Hochhaus writes on golang-nuts:\r\n\r\n\u003e Starting in go 1.6.0 issue #14568 caused http.TimeoutHandler() to not behave correctly (timer was started too early and was not reset per http request). This bug was introduced in Dec 2015 in 0478f7b9d6e9e0461e67716f003f4dbf26bf634d and resolved in Feb 2016 in bd68b8abc2e3ceaa3b9bde98568a4a9af8bde40f.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e Any chance the fix could be included in 1.6.2 as the bug was a 1.6 regression?\r\n\r\nI agree we should backport the fix. I never realized it was introduced in 1.6.\r\n\r\n@adg, @rsc?\r\n",
