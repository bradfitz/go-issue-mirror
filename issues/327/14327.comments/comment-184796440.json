You'll also need to add `newosproc0` and `libpreinit` to runtime/os1_freebsd.go if you haven't already done that.  `libpreinit` can be copied from os1_linux.go.  `newosproc0` can not--it will have to be adjusted to start a new FreeBSD thread, I guess using `thr_new` like `newosproc`.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, it's not expected that you will be able to `dlopen` a library built with `-buildmode=shared`.  You are expected to `dlopen` a library built with `-buildmode=c-shared`--note that extra \"c-\".\r\n\r\nIt's fine to send in a code review for broken code, just put \"DO NOT REVIEW\" in the description.
