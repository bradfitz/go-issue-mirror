Reduce the\nproblem to a short program of a dozen lines or less.\n\nRead the documentation carefully before you do your homework.\n\n\"The receiver type must be of the form T or *T where T is a type name.\"\nMethod declarations, The Go Programming Language Specification.\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html#Method_declarations\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html#Method_declarations\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\"The rule about pointers vs. values for receivers is that value methods can be invoked\non pointers and values, but pointer methods can only be invoked on pointers. This is\nbecause pointer methods can modify the receiver; invoking them on a copy of the value\nwould cause those modifications to be discarded.\"\nPointers vs. Values, Methods, Effective Go.\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#pointers_vs_values\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#pointers_vs_values\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
