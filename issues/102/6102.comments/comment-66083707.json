My total is slightly short of 28, and I am left with\n7 examples:\n\n2 of them are counting the things sent on a channel:\nsrc/pkg/go/printer/printer_test.go:   for _ = range idents(f) {\nsrc/pkg/log/syslog/syslog_test.go:            for _ = range done {\n\n1 of them controls hitting a service or data structure concurrently, for testing:\nsrc/pkg/database/sql/sql_test.go:                     for _ = range reqs {\n\n3 of them are a lazy way of writing \"for i := 0; i \u0026lt; n; i++ {\"\nsrc/cmd/cgo/out.go:                   for _ = range r.Names {\nsrc/pkg/bufio/bufio_test.go:  for _ = range buf {\nsrc/pkg/os/exec/exec.go:      for _ = range c.goroutine {\n\n1 of them counts the UTF-8 runes in a string\nsrc/pkg/unicode/utf8/utf8.go: for _ = range s {\n\n\n\nRob, you've hit this twice. Can you elaborate?\u003c/pre\u003e",
