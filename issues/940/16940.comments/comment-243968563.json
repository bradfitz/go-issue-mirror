Reverting on every single bug, during the open dev period, will add a lot of overhead. I am all for reverting when it's during the freeze, or it causes significant breakage that might impede other developers or cause unnoticed further build breakage, or the bug is subtle or unknown and might take a long time to track down, etc. This is a small bug with a minor impact and a minor fix. Let's just fix it.\r\n\r\n\u003e It was 1 build failure out of many thousands.\r\n\r\nOuch.\r\n",
