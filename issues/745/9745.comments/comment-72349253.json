	"body": "If you look at the source,  comparing ServeFile with FileServer, you\r\nwill see that the redirection is intentionally disabled.\r\n\r\nI think it's because ServeFile is a lower-level routine and if you want\r\nto use the directory listing feature, you should handle the redirection\r\nin your code. And if you just want to serve some files from the file\r\nsystem, FileServer is a better choice.\r\n\r\nAlso, the docs says that ServeFile serves the content of the file or\r\ndirectory, but that doesn't include any redirection, so the docs and\r\ncode agrees. Closing as working as intended.",
