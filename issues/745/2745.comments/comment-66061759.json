I would be fine with printing an error for this\nkind of code.\n\nIn gccgo this code crashed because of an infinite recursion in some code trying to\ndecide whether the types were the same.  I guess that is the gccgo equivalent to eqtype.\n I fixed it by passing down a list of types \"assumed to be equivalent.\"  I just built\nthe list on the stack as I went.  Then when I start comparing two interface types, I\nfirst check the list; if both types are on it, return true.  This shuts down the\ninfinite recursion and treats the types as equal if nothing indicates otherwise.\u003c/pre\u003e",
