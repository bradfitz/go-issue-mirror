	"body": "Currently at net/http/server.go:1339 c.serve() responds to a bad request (e.g. http://golang.org/%L3 ) by responding with 400 Bad request without a body. This results in a blank browser window when not behind a proxy, which is not helpful for end users, and nothing in logs to indicate the cause. Would it be possible to add a simple body to this request with something like:\r\n\r\n    io.WriteString(c.rwc, \"HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\\r\\n\\r\\n400 Bad Request\")\r\n\r\nand/or to insert a line of logging before the response:\r\n\r\n    c.server.logf(\"http: 400 Bad Request: %v\", err)\r\n\r\nso that the server logs all significant errors encountered during this serve() method, as it does for TLS handshake error and panics in the handlers? \r\n",
