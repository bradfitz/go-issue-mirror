Your program crashes while allocating 17GB array. It fails with\nmessage:\nthrow: runtime: cannot map pages in arena address space\nLooking close I can see Windows VirtualAlloc function fails trying to commit 17GB of\nearlier reserved memory (MEM_COMMIT). The error message I get is ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND -\nnot sure what that means.\n\nYour program won't even compile for GOARCH=386:\nmemconsumer.go:25: type [17000]Item larger than address space\n\nPerhaps, other will help.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @alexbrainman._\n\n_Status changed to **HelpWanted**._",
