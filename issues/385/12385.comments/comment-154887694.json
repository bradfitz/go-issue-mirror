The code is problematic because when specifying a path inside GOROOT or GOPATH, go/build will set ImportPath to a plausible import path. Whether the package actually exists isn't checked.\r\n\r\nThus, with `GOPATH=/go`, `ImportDir(\"/go/src/foo\", 1)` will unconditionally set ImportPath to \"foo\".\r\n\r\nI am wondering whether the ./ioutil -\u003e io/ioutil rewrite is even a useful feature and whether the logic should be fixed, or removed entirely.",
