I don't think UTF-8 is allowed in headers.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e Even if this \"works\" right now, it's just us testing our own misbehavior probably.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e Any change needs to cite relevant parts of specs.\r\n\r\nYou are right UTF-8 is not allowed.  \r\n\r\n```\r\nThe \"Location\" header field is used in some responses to refer to a\r\n   specific resource in relation to the response.  The type of\r\n   relationship is defined by the combination of request method and\r\n   status code semantics.\r\n\r\n     Location = URI-reference\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom what i can read they should be escaped while doing a redirect since Location header is a URI.  Not sure why it isn't happening though.  Will see why this is not happening.",
