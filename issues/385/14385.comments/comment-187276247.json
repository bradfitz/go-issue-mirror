	"body": "Great Andrew, I tried listing the versions and it works great. For people wanting to listing versions, I provide some samples below.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample of how to listing all Linux 64 bit releases (with raw gs:// urls):\r\n```\r\ngsutil ls gs://golang | grep \"linux-amd64\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a sample of parsing out stable release version numbers:\r\n```\r\ngsutil ls gs://golang | grep \"linux-amd64\" | sed 's|gs://golang/go||g' | sed  's|.linux-amd64.tar.gz||g' | grep -v \"beta\" | grep -v \"rc\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a sample of getting download links for all stable releases (https:// urls):\r\n```\r\ngsutil ls gs://golang | grep \"linux-amd64\" | sed 's|gs://golang/|https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/|g' | grep -v \"beta\" | grep -v \"rc\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the `.sha256` files have been uploaded I think it's okay to close this issue, leaving it open until then. Thanks again for the quick replies and fixes.",
