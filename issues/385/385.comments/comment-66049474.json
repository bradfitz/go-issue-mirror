At the time\nthis error message is being generated, the static nthr variable in linux.c is 0, so\nthere is no info about ANY thread in the system.\n\nThe source code for primes3 is here: \u003ca href=\"http://gopaste.org/view/pepxJ\"\u003ehttp://gopaste.org/view/pepxJ\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nIt was compiled like so:\n% 8g primes3.go\n% 8l -o primes3 primes3.go\n\nI do not see any options in the 8g or 8l help messages to add profiling support, so I\nassume they are not required.\n\nHere is my environment:\n\n% hg identify\n7929874a70ae+ tip\n\n% uname -a\nLinux mzraly-ubuntu 2.6.31-15-generic #50-Ubuntu SMP Tue Nov 10 14:54:29 UTC 2009\ni686 GNU/Linux\n\n% env|grep GO\nGOOS=linux\nGOROOT=/home/mzraly/go\nGOARCH=386\nGOBIN=/home/mzraly/go/bin\n\nThis is actually a guest system running in Sun Virtual Box.  The host system is\nWindows XP Pro SP3 running on a Toshiba Satellite with Intel Core2 Duo CPU P8400.\n\nNote: I get the same error with and without applying the patch attached to this error\nreport by bslesinsky.  I didn't expect otherwise, but thought I should mention it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
