I think that your lower timing of 7% of slow down is not because of the\nstart/stop but because you are also accounting for the Push and the rand.Int, that run\nat the same speed than before. \n\nIn any case, it is not a major issue, and the slow down would be diluted if the heap is\nreally used and not just tested.\n\nRegards.\u003c/pre\u003e",
