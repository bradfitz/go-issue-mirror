	"body": "Using ```go1.5```\r\n\r\nI discovered that \"go test\" crashes after the timeout of 600s has passed. I was running all the benchmarks in ```compress/flate``` and I set ```-benchtime 10s```. Since each benchmark will run for about 10s or more, and there are 36 benchmarks in that package, this occupies at least 360s, which is running close to the default of 600s.\r\n\r\nIn situations like these, the ```go test``` tool should be able to figure out that a timeout of 600s is cutting things close when running 36 benchmarks each for 10s and choose a timeout that is more appropriate.",
