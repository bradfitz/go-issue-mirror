In both cases we never see the same RDTSC value (it never appears to go backwards on our single core).\r\n\r\nWhat I do see is under load and on idle the RDTSC has 100x variability in the time difference between ticks. On HW I may get 100 ticks diff each call or 300 ticks diff. But on the VM it varies between 1-30 to 300000 ticks. \r\n\r\n@dvyukov I wasn't able to find any code that relied on the calculated tick frequency; it looks like the RDTSC time is directly encoded into the field and directly read before the events are sorted. But maybe I missed something.",
