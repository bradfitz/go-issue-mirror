The best\n\u003e idea I can have is make StructField.Index a slice of a hidden\n\u003e StructField.index [4]int so that it doesn't escape and cover most cases.\nThis doesn't work: assignment of a StructField value will not update the\nslice, and now you have a slice pointing back into the original StructField.\n",
