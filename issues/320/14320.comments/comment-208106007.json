	"body": "When we originally designed `ParseFiles` it was illegal to redeclare templates, and so it did indeed return an error. With the addition of the new `block` feature we removed the restriction on template redeclaration, and so now `ParseFiles` has this subtle behavior. That's not great.\r\n\r\nWe could patch up `ParseFiles` so that it does return an error in this instance, but we've already shipped a major Go version with this behavior and so people might be relying on it already.\r\n\r\nThat leaves us with a documentation fix, which is easily done. I will prepare it now, but I'm not happy about it.\r\n\r\ncc @robpike in case he has other ideas.",
