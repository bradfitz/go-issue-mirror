	"body": "I understand that making the runtime and Cgo cooperate is difficult, but moving too far towards the \"no memory can cross the boundary\" side is really poisonous to things like OpenGL libraries. Graphics is already difficult to work with in Go due to things like threading constraints (especially on Mac where event loops must be on the main thread). Breaking all Go struct formatting and forbidding memory from crossing over puts a pretty extreme burden on anybody that wants to manipulate vertex, texture, framebuffer, transformation matrix, and so on data from the Go side.",
