	"body": "Well the idea is that you would create some manifest file that describes the compilation that you consider valid, what inputs files and object files are good and what compiler what used. Some signature hash of those things would be stored. That manifest file would be shipped with the compiler and it would say that the runtime lib has been compiled with a certain compiler.\r\n\r\nIf you use a different compiler then that manifest would be invalid because it includes what compiler is used and the files would be recompiled.\r\n\r\nYou could tell the compiler to ignore that file like make -b and it would recompile the objects, otherwise it would reuse the object files if it noticed that compiler to the source changed.",
