	"body": "This code is not a bug for ordinary usage.  People using gccgo do not rebuild the standard library, because it is built as part of building gccgo itself.  There is a special case here: using gccgo to bootstrap the gc compiler.  Without looking into the details, I imagine that something about the setting of GOROOT is causing the go tool to decide that it is looking at the standard library sources, and deciding that since it is using gccgo, it does not need to build them.\r\n\r\nSo somebody needs to investigate this issue, figure out what the real problem is (whether it is my speculation or something else), and figure out what the right fix is.",
