(run 'go version')\ngo version go1.1 darwin/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI've attached a .tar.gz that contains four .csv files and a Go program that reads them\nand prints them.\nTwo of them files have quoted fields show lazy quotes in the middle of a field\n(inp_quoted_end.csv) and at the end of a field (inp_quoted.csv), and two are the same\nthing but unquoted fields (inp_unquoted_end.csv, inp_unquoted.csv, respectively). Only\nthe quoted fields with lazy quotes at the end break (inp_quoted.csv).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/6258/0/broken_lazy_quotes.tar.gz\"\u003ebroken_lazy_quotes.tar.gz\u003c/a\u003e (487754 bytes)",
