	"body": "I started to write docs in helpBuildmode in cmd/go/help.go, but it's too horrible to make people dig into the crypto/x509 sources to figure out what options to pass.  I think what we need to do is have a way for cmd/go to print out the accumulated cgo LDFLAGS from the packages added to a c-archive or c-shared build.  Then people can in principle capture that at the time they build the archive/shared library (probably using a Makefile), and pass it on their final linker command line.\r\n\r\nSo, postponing until 1.7.",
