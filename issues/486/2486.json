It returns\nthe number of bytes read and the Error, if any. EOF is signaled by a zero count with err\nset to EOF. ReadAt always returns a non-nil Error when n != len(b).\u0026quot;\n\nwhen EOF is encountered during  a read, you can have a \u0026gt; 0 return value and EOF.  How\nabout simply saying:\n\n\u0026quot;ReadAt reads len(b) bytes from the File starting at byte offset off. It returns\nthe number of bytes read and if n != len(b) an error. End of file is signaled by the EOF\nerror.\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e",
