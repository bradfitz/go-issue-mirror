I have a fork that uses my approach to handling the\nmember header to deal with blocked decoding, but maintaining this while bringing in\nchanges from compress/gzip (and keeping public-facing types and fields interoperable\nwith that package) while not difficult it painful.\n\nI was hoping to retire that fork when the fix for this issue and the (otherwise\nunrelated) CL13512052 goes in,  before moving on to deal with the long term\nimplementation of the BGZF reader which will be doing partially parallel blocked read\nahead with block caching. This requires careful handling of gzip member header fields\nthat I'm only just able to keep my head around in a stable world, changing API is likely\nto blow away my capacity to handle that.\u003c/pre\u003e",
