What I'm interested\nin knowing is if the change that comes is likely to be in line with what was tentatively\nproposed there. I am asking because I have been holding off work on my package waiting\nfor this issue, so now that it looks like if will possibly be another three to six\nmonths (depending on how the release cycle is dealt with this round), I don't think I\ncan wait for the standard library any more.\u003c/pre\u003e",
