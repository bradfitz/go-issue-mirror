	"body": "@jhowardmsft I can build the exe now, thank you. I can reproduce your problem with gdb. I am pretty sure it is dup of #10776.\r\n\r\n`go build` builds pure Go executable. It has dwarf info and all.\r\n\r\nBut `go build -tags daemon` imports some packages that use cgo (I can see github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3, but there might be others), therefore final executable has some cgo code in it.\r\n\r\nWe used to link all windows executables ourselves, but we had many unresolved issues with cgo. So starting from go1.5 we started to use external linker (gcc) to build cgo binaries. We have made everything work except dwarf generation (see #10776).\r\n\r\nYou can still use internal linker as in go1.4, but it is not default now. So you would have to say explicitly:\r\n```\r\ngo build -v -tags daemon -ldflags \"-linkmode=internal\"\r\n```\r\nbut, like I said before, there are some know issue with our internal linker.\r\n\r\nI hope it helps.\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n\r\nPS: @glycerine sorry for hijacking your issue.",
