	"body": "When building Go on Linux with musl instead of glibc, os/user doesn't work:\r\n\r\n$ go test os/user \r\n--- FAIL: TestCurrent (0.00s)\r\n\tuser_test.go:23: Current: user: unreasonable _SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX of -1\r\n--- FAIL: TestLookup (0.00s)\r\n\tuser_test.go:64: Current: user: unreasonable _SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX of -1\r\n--- FAIL: TestLookupId (0.00s)\r\n\tuser_test.go:82: Current: user: unreasonable _SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX of -1\r\n\r\nThat's because Go assumes that on Linux, _SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX will always be \u003e0, which isn't true.\r\n\r\nI have a fix for this ready. Is this something for Go 1.5, or should I wait till 1.6?",
