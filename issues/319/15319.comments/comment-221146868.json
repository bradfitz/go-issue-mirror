	"body": "This is happening because of the dispose in scanstack. Because of the rutime.GC calls, alls stacks are being scanned during mark termination, which causes every scanstack to dispose its buffer. Even though there are only a few pointers in the buffer when it's disposed here, it goes to the \"full\" queue. Since all of the stack scans happen before we start draining mark work during mark termination, the number of work buffers is proportional to the number of stacks, rather than the number of pointers. In fact, the math works out almost exactly: 213 MB / 2048 bytes/workbuf = 1.09e5 workbufs â‰ˆ 1e5 goroutines.",
