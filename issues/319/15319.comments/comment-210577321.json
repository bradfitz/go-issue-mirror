	"body": "The channel may actually be important here. On Linux, it went from 2,590 bytes in 1.5.2 to 4,709 bytes in 1.6. However, if you replace `\u003c-ch` with `select {}`, it only goes up to 2,600 bytes in 1.6. This suggests that, at least on Linux, the channel operation used to fit in the initial 2K stack allocation and now doesn't. The explanation may be different on Windows, however, since there the initial stack is 8K, so it would grow to 16K if it did grow, which is more than the observed 11K.",
