However, if you replace \u003c-ch with select {}, it only goes up to 2,600 bytes in 1.6. This suggests that, at least on Linux, the channel operation used to fit in the initial 2K stack allocation and now doesn't.\r\n\r\nThis sounds pretty bad :(\r\nIs there justified reason for such a large stack size fo channel operations? This effectively prohibits using channels in memory-effective highly concurrent code operating millions of goroutines.",
