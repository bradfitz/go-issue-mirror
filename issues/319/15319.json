	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.6, 1.6.1, 1.5.2\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nset GOARCH=amd64\r\nset GOBIN=\r\nset GOEXE=.exe\r\nset GOHOSTARCH=amd64\r\nset GOHOSTOS=windows\r\nset GOOS=windows\r\nset GOPATH=C:\\Development\\Projects\\go\r\nset GORACE=\r\nset GOROOT=C:\\Go\r\nset GOTOOLDIR=C:\\Go\\pkg\\tool\\windows_amd64\r\nset GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\r\nset CC=gcc\r\nset GOGCCFLAGS=-m64 -mthreads -fmessage-length=0\r\nset CXX=g++\r\nset CGO_ENABLED=1\r\n\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\nRan the following program on windows using go 1.6.1 and found go routines using ~11kB of memory each.  Decided to run the test again using go 1.5.2 to see if there was a difference in the amount of memory being used per go routine.\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/bgP8fs5O7q\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI had expected to see go routines using approximately the same memory in different versions of go.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nGo routines were using ~11kB of memory in 1.6.1 and 9.5kB in 1.5.2.\r\n\r\n",
