	"body": "It would be helpful if the Contribution Guidelines page (https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html#Code_review) clearly documented which guidelines submitted contributions are expected to adhere to.  For example, either in the \"Code Review\" section of that page, or in the \"Make a Change\" section, it should probably point readers at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments\r\n\r\n...and explicitly state that submissions should follow the guidelines there.  Today, it references https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReview, but only near the very end under \"more information\", which might lead some to never read those links, or at least not in the context of \"required for submission\".\r\n\r\nLikewise, if submissions are expected to follow all of the guidelines found in \"effective go\" (https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html), it should indicate that as well.\r\n\r\nIt might also be helpful to point to https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#useful-test-failures in the Testing Redux section, reminding contributors of the expected practice.\r\n\r\nThis will save time during the review process since none of the automated tools included with Go seem to complain about these things (e.g. '_' in variable names is not warned about) and less frustration for everyone involved.",
