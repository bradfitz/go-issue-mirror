	"body": "Hmm. I got v8worker working but I can't reproduce the problem still. I see the combining step happening but it takes under a second. Of course, I probably have a different version of Xcode than you do, that is probably writing out different files.\r\n\r\nIf you can still see this happening, please try adding `-ldflags '-cpuprofile=/tmp/link.prof'` and then run `go tool pprof $(go tool -n link) /tmp/link.prof` and play around. Useful commands: `top10`, `web`. See also http://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs. If you do get a profile I'd be interested to see it:\r\n\r\n    go tool pprof --svg $(go tool -n link) /tmp/link.prof \u003e/tmp/link.prof.svg\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
