Generate some sample JSON data: make sample-data\n3. Run the go json benchmark: make go\n\nOptionally, you can run some of the other language benchmarks using \"make python\", \"make\njava\", etc.\n\nHere are the results I get on my test machine:\nmake go: 14.36 MB/s in 34.932531708s\nmake python_simplejson: 39 MB/s 525831000bytes in 12seconds\nmake java: 48.82 MB/s 525822000 bytes in 10.27 s\n\nNote: The # bytes is different for java because it's not counting end-of-line characters.\u003c/pre\u003e",
