The Java version is basically\nonly doing JSON Validation, so I'll modify it to parse the actual document structure.\n\nIn the meantime, I've added a new make target `make sample-data` that will generate a\n~500MB test file, as well as a few more make targets to simplify running the various\ntests.\n\nAgain, Go's performance when actually parsing the objects is:\nDuration: 35.149537439s, 14.27 MB/s\n\nFor reference, here is the performance for a few of the other languages/runtimes on my\nmachine:\nJavascript (spidermonkey):\n39.550669327341836MB/s 525822000bytes in 12.679s\n\nPython (simplejson):\n37 MB/s 525831000bytes in 13seconds\n\nC++ (rapidjson):\n163 MB/s 525831000 bytes in 3 seconds\u003c/pre\u003e",
