This will generate a file not strictly compliant to the ushar\nformat, but the majority\nof tar implementions (GNU tar and those based on libarchive) will accept it\nwithout issue.\n\nthe current way of using OLDGNU_MAGIC doesn't look right, as GNU tar itself\ndoesn't\nuse base-256 encoding when generating OLDGNU_MAGIC files.\n\n/cc @dsymonds",
