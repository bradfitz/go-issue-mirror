Reproduced identical output in both Ubuntu (well, mint) and OSX 10.11.\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n```\r\n$ go get github.com/conslo/badlink\r\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/conslo/badlink\r\n$ go install\r\n$ go test\r\n```\r\n\r\n4.

What did you see instead?\r\n```\r\n# testmain\r\n/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/link: cannot open file /usr/local/go/pkg/linux_amd64/github.com/conslo/badlink.a: open /usr/local/go/pkg/linux_amd64/github.com/conslo/badlink.a: no such file or directory\r\nFAIL    github.com/conslo/badlink [build failed]\r\n```\r\n\r\n@davecheney and I have already had a bit of a back and forth on this already on golang-nuts (I'll avoid actually requiring anyone to read this, but for attribution sake it's [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/OAQzIysNSuU)). It seems if I replace the dot import in the test file (`badlink_test.go`):\r\n```Go\r\nimport \".\"\r\n```\r\nwith a full import:\r\n```Go\r\nimport \"github.com/conslo/badlink\"\r\n```\r\nIt fixes it. However the dot import did (and still does) work in 1.5.3.\r\n\r\nDave thinks the dot import should be a compiler error. I agree. However I'm a bit confused as to the state of relative imports in go. I held they were [a deliberate omission](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/3515#issuecomment-66066361), but there's mention of [limited support](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/6147#issuecomment-94483157) which I don't know the details of. And again, this *does* work in 1.5.3, so unless I screwed something else up (repeatedly, on different machines) this is a regression.\r\n\r\nPossibly related?:\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/14609\r\n\r\nFor the record, I don't generally like relative imports, but saw the dot import in tests at a talk and thought that it seemed like a nice exception. A way for a `_test` package to say \"I'm testing myself\". But I'd be happy if this was just a more clear error.",
