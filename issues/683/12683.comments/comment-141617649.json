I filed this issue for the sake of completeness, but I suspect it would not be a wise use of engineering resources to support this case unless it were trivial.\r\n\r\nNot supporting 32 bit iOS Simulator means in practice that you need to configure the Xcode build settings to only build 64 bit for the iOS Simulator but still 32/64 bit for the device, which is a bit tricky, but that could be easily documented:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/627915/9974495/8eda5baa-5e46-11e5-963b-8c2cf1c79f29.png)\r\n\r\nBut maybe one of the folks from https://github.com/golang/mobile/ should chime in on this topic?",
