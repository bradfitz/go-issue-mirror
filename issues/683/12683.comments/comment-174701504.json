I'm working on a shared library that will be go-backed, and if I distribute a fat binary that doesn't include 32-bit then many ordinary developers will be very confused IF they happen to pick the iPhone 5 or below for the simulator (often done to test the smaller screen size explicitly, or implicitly since its smaller on your laptop screen).",
