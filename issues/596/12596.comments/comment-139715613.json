	"body": "You're trying to allocate more memory than your system is giving you.  I tried this on my mac (12GB physical) and it runs well up to around 4GB, then performance varies widely depending on whether fatslice is resized or not in the given printing interval.  If it is not resized, writes go really quickly.  If it is resized the resulting copy makes the machine swap like crazy.\r\n\r\nTried it on tip, which is approximately 1.5.1.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Go keeps the heap at ~2x live data, so a 4GB fatslice means you get an 8GB heap.\r\n\r\nCheck your ulimit.  Despite having a 64GB machine, you might not be getting anywhere near that much memory from the OS.\r\n\r\nwritten  256 MB total. Speed last chunk:  387.33416552482265 MB/s\r\nwritten  512 MB total.
