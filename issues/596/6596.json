	"body": "\u003cpre\u003ecgo currently looks at the error message text from a trial compilation to deduce whether\na name C.foo refers to a function, type, variable, or constant. We can and should change\ncgo to generate programs such that only the presence or absence of an error on a\nparticular line is needed. This will make cgo much less dependent on the compiler\ndetails.\u003c/pre\u003e",
