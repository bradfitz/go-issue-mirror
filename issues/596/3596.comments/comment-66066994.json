Theoretically, the size of a segment is\nunbounded, as a starter can be succeeded by an unbounded number of\nmodifiers.  The Unicode spec suggests terminating a segment if the number\nof non-starters reaches 30.  (30+1) * utf8.UTFMax = 124.  We added one\nextra rune for safety, making it an even 128 bytes.\u003c/pre\u003e",
