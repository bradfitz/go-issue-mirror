	"body": "The new export format can handle arbitrary cycles. However, to match the existing compiler infrastructure, tracking of arbitrary cycles is disabled for now (bexport.go: trackAllTypes = false). As a consequence, some cycles are not recognized.\r\n\r\ntest/fixedbugs/bug398.go crashes if the interfaces are exported and the new export format is used with trackAllTypes disabled. Once we track all types again, this test case can export the cyclic interfaces again.\r\n\r\nNote that the existing exporter cannot properly export these interfaces either. But it recognizes this case and doesn't crash. But the export data is invalid and cannot be imported.\r\n",
