	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n- go version go1.6 linux/amd64\r\n- go version go1.6 darwin/amd64\r\n- go playground\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\n- darwin/amd64\r\n- linux/amd64\r\n- go playground\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nAttempt to redefine a text/template as an empty string using parse, and then executed the template:\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/gotXx8qF3e\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nI expected the template to successfully execute and produce an empty string.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if it is expected behaviour to not allow redefining as an empty string, I expect an error to be returned on the \"Parse\" call.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nThe execute function returned the following error:\r\ntemplate: test: \"test\" is an incomplete or empty template; defined templates are: \"test\"\r\n\r\n",
