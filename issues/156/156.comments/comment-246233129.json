But as we don't have compiler warnings, and refusing the compile the code would be wrong, the only thing we could do here is compile this code more efficiently. Since it's just going to panic anyway, and no one will ever write this code with intent to actually use it, there's no point.\r\n\r\nIf there's anywhere this belongs, it is vet. With help from SSA this should be detectable. I wonder how common it is. In any case, that should be a separate issue (feel free to open one, anyone). Closing this one.",
