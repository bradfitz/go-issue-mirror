Cgo calls use\nthe same locking mechanics, and this fix prevents cgo from getting extra threads. Since\ncgo should recieve extra thread when it ends up in a blocking syscall or something, that\nfix really breaks things. Now, no matter what you can't get more than GOMAXPROCS threads\n(which is 1 by default) and this is really bad. Correct me if I'm wrong.\u003c/pre\u003e",
