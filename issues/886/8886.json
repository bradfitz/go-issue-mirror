So linker can't strip them.\nWe should pass a special object that contains only necessary information to new:\n1. size\n2. size class (needs to be ignored for arrays with more than one element)\n2. name string\n3. embed GC pointer bitmask or a pointer to satellite GC bitmask (if both are zero, then\nit's noptr type)\u003c/pre\u003e",
