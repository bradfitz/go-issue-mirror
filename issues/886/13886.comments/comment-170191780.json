Seemingly this is guaranteed by AEAD.Open's documentation:\r\n\r\n        // Open decrypts and authenticates ciphertext, authenticates the\r\n        // additional data and, if successful, appends the resulting plaintext\r\n        // to dst, returning the updated slice. [...]\r\n        //\r\n        // The ciphertext and dst may alias exactly or not at all.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the new AES-GCM code is appending data to dst even when unsuccessful.",
