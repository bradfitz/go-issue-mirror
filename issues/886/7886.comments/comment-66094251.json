The tests impeded are for code that\n*uses* the constrained interface, not the implementation of the constrained interface.\n\nThis also implies that the advice 'not to use it' is unhelpful, too.  If others have\nused it already I cannot easily test my code that calls them without invoking them. And\nI cannot modify their packages. I am forced to wrap the interface with another and\ndelegate, or some such unnatural act. Hence my reference to mockgen.\u003c/pre\u003e",
