It would be, if the\nExported and non-Exported methods were treated the same way.\n\nI think the spec should say something about type compatibility in this case, but no\nmention is made of this.\n\nI still consider this to be a language bug (or anomaly, if you wish) because it makes\nstubbing or mocking interfaces that exploit the restriction impossible: one cannot\ncreate a type-compatible implementation of an interface with a non-exported method\noutside of the implementing package.\u003c/pre\u003e",
