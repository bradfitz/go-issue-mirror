There\nare a lot of language mechanisms where we (the designers and implementers) have a very\nclear notion and understanding, but where we didn't do a good job of writing it down\nclearly. This is why we are still refining the spec. Except for pathological or academic\ncorner cases which are irrelevant in practice but matter for an implementation, we do\nnot make changes to the language. This is _not_ a pathological case, and we are not\ngoing to change it. I will try to make the spec clearer, though.\n\n2) In case there's any doubt: While I didn't write the compiler, I did write go/types\nwhich requires complete understanding of the subtle issues of interfaces, exports and\nnon-exported names, specifically with respect to struct fields and method names. So, I\ncan assure you that I am very familiar with the issues. In fact, go/types was written\nwith the understanding of the spec in mind and exposed several (corner-case) bugs in the\ncompilers.\n\nPlease let's stop this discussion. Your point (spec is unclear) is taken, and I will fix\nit. Thanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
