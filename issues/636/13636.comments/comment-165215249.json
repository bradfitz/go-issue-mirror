The uuid library has its own __u8 definition that comes from linux/types.h I think. Not sure why this 3rd party code needs to ``#define`` its own __u8 perhaps because it's multi-platform.\r\nIn the end it seems that both the uuid lib and the code define __u8 as unsigned char. Is there anything that cgo could do to recognize that it's really the same thing?",
