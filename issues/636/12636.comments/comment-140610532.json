[client.go](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/pkg/cmd/experimental/diagnostics/client.go) returns *no* errors for me (on my local machine and a brand new CentOS Docker container with only golang, git and wget installed) and some other developers, but \r\n```\r\npkg/cmd/experimental/diagnostics/client.go:37: github.com/openshift/origin/pkg/diagnostics/client.ConfigContext composite literal uses unkeyed fields\r\n```\r\nFor yet other developers. Checking the file, you can see that there are indeed unkeyed fields.\r\n\r\nWe are tracking our outputs at this issue: https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/4682",
