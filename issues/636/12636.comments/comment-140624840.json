Once I've deleted that binary and re-installed using `go get`, however, my output does not change. I do not think that the version that shipped with `go1.4.2` is being run, as the error I am seeing is about unknown identifiers in an Example, and the commit that brought that error into `go vet` (https://github.com/golang/tools/commit/a25a8d567b492f9a659e1e1838cc093d5bf278a0) pushed into the git repo yesterday.",
