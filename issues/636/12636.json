	"body": "We are attempting to integrate `go vet`'s static analysis into our continuous integration pipeline for [OpenShift Origin](https://github.com/openshift/origin) but have noticed some interesting behavior. \r\n\r\nDifferent developers with the same `go version` (`1.4.2`) and `golang.org/x/tools/` at the same `HEAD` (`c262de8 tools/cmd/vet: Sort checks list alphabetically.`) will see wildly different results from running `go vet`. We run the tool on a subset of directories within our repository, as seen [here](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/hack/verify-govet.sh). \r\n\r\nAll of the output that we see does indeed result from defects in the code, so none of it is spurious, but some developers do not see many errors while others see ~50.\r\n\r\nWhat factors affect the output of `go vet`? I think the people that have tested this have all been on different operating systems (OSX, Fedora 21,22). What can we do to ensure deterministic results?",
