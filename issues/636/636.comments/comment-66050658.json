Instead, when the go runtime is unable to create another\nsystem thread using clone(), it panics in a rather unfriendly way. You get the same\nresult if you replace net.Dial() with syscall.Sleep(1e11). Note also that decreasing\nthe thread limit by somthing like \"ulimit -u 500\" will make the problem easier to\nreproduce - you only need about 500 goroutines to cause the panic.\u003c/pre\u003e",
