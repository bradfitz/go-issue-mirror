When it finds such a thread, and there is other work for it\ndo, it spins up a new thread to run new goroutines.\n\nThe effect is that you can have very different profiling results depending on how long\nyour cgo calls run.  Could that be the issue here?\n\nIf that's not the issue, please try to provide a complete standalone example that shows\nthe problem.  Thanks.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**._",
