	"body": "The dev.ssa scheduler adds values with the same priority and use count in whatever order they previously occurred. I suggest that we take lineno into account as a third tier sorting parameter. The goal would be to find the value with the lineno closest to the most recently scheduled value. This will do two things. (1) Make debugging nicer by having instructions better follow the original code. (2) Reduce value deltas in the pcln table, possibly making it smaller.\r\n\r\nOpinions?\r\n\r\ncc @randall77 @derekparker @crawshaw @tzneal \r\n",
