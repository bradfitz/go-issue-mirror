	"body": "According to the spec, ideal floats do not have a -0.  However, -0 is representable (and used) by the compiler's internal ideal float implementation.  Fix the implementation to get rid of -0 (or hide it from the rest of the compiler).\r\n\r\nSee issue #12576 \r\n\r\nThe compiler uses cmd/compile/internal/gc/mpgetflt{32} to do the conversion.  Maybe a check inside this routine is enough?\r\n\r\nWe've had to sprinkle +0.0 around to get around this problem, like this:\r\n    s.constFloat32(n.Type, mpgetflt32(f)+0.0)\r\n",
