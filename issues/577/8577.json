If not, hope someone will\ndirect me to where I need to go.\n\nWas fiddling with templates and I noticed that, although the line number reported in a\ntemplate error is correct and refers to the specific template in which the error\noccurred, the name of the template reported is incorrect.  Here's an example:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/cf0y7Sw9lQ\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/cf0y7Sw9lQ\u003c/a\u003e\n\nYou'll notice here that when run, we get the error: html/template:ONE:12: no such\ntemplate \u0026quot;dummy\u0026quot;.  \u0026quot;dummy\u0026quot; is a reference to a template that does\nnot exist in the set, so we'd expect this error.  The error is reported as having\noccurred on line 12 of template ONE, which is the base template.  In fact, the error\noccurs in line 12 of THREE, an embedded template.\n\nSo it would make sense if it reported the error as being in the filled version of ONE,\nalthough this would not be terribly helpful.  It would also make sense if it reported\nthe line number of the template in which the error occurred -- by far the most helpful\nbehavior.  But we seem to have a mix here that is just confusing.  Looks like a bug to\nme.  The error should report the specific template in which the error occurred, not the\nfirst template in the set.\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups\n\u0026quot;golang-dev\u0026quot; group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to\ngolang-dev+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit \u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/optout\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/optout\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e",
