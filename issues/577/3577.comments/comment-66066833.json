I'm friendly here, and love Go and you guys for all Go\nwork you're doing! :) I'm just trying to point out from the point of view of language\nuser that it's bit confusing why it doesn't work without looking into source code.\n\nAnyhow I made copy of base64 for our project and made change in base64.Read function to\npass io.ReadAtLeast error directly to higher level without caching it internally, and it\nfixes the issue...\n\n\tnn, err = io.ReadAtLeast(d.r, d.buf[d.nbuf:nn], 4-d.nbuf)\n\td.nbuf += nn\n\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn 0, err\n\t}\u003c/pre\u003e",
