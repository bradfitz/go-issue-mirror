I used it just because I\nencountered it by using base64 with websockets, probably other decoders have this issue\ntoo.\n\nI just expected that temporary error like timeout is handled in the way that decoder\nwill retry Read at later point. I didn't look into base64 code, but it sounds like\nyou're caching error result from Read and then returning it without calling Read again.\n\nAnyhow I'm going to change my code to not rely on piping thru decoder.\u003c/pre\u003e",
