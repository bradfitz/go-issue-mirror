That is why I think we should support them as little as possible. For example, why this test http://play.golang.org/p/uF7_491yCT fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\go\\path\\mine\\src\\foo\u003ego test -v\r\n=== RUN TestNormal\r\n--- PASS: TestNormal (0.00s)\r\n=== RUN TestLong\r\n--- FAIL: TestLong (0.00s)\r\n        main_test.go:24: open hello.txt: The system cannot find the path specified.\r\nFAIL\r\nexit status 1\r\nFAIL    foo     0.109s\r\n\r\nC:\\go\\path\\mine\\src\\foo\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, if you insist, send a change http://golang.org/doc/contribute.html Others might think differently.\r\n\r\nAlex",
