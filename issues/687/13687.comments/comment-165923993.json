Thanks for the PR!\r\n\r\nHowever, our project doesn't use GitHub's Pull Requests,\r\nso we can't accept your contribution this way.\r\n\r\nWe instead use a code review system called Gerrit.\r\nYou can find the details in our Contribution Guidelines:\r\nhttps://golang.org/doc/contribute.html\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this Pull Request now.\r\nPlease consider sending this change using Gerrit.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn automatically creating issues: sounds like a nice idea. If a new issue is being created, then it should just link to the pull request, which includes the diff (not copy/explain the diff in the issue body).\r\n\r\nIt's not straightforward to simply copy a patch from a diff like that into a gerrit change, since we'd need to ensure the person who contributed it has signed the project's CLA.",
