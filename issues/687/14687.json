I'd expect the milestone to be available for viewing, or to not be linked from the release notes.\r\n\r\nOf the 23 released versions of Go (go1, go1.0.1, ..., go1.6), 21 have matching milestones on GitHub. The Go1.2.2 and Go1.5.3 milestones are missing, though I don't know of any links to the former.\r\n\r\nHas the milestone been intentionally removed?",
