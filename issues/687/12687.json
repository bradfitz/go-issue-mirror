	"title": "image/png: Integer underflow bug on 32-bit systems",
	"body": "I noticed this bug in Go 1.5.1 (and earlier versions) on windows/386, but it doesn't affect 64-bit versions (at least not versions that use a 64-bit `int` type).\r\n\r\nThe reason for this can be found on line 733 of image/png/reader.go, where `min(len(ignored), int(length))` is calculated. `length` is a 32-bit unsigned value and already guaranteed to be greater than 0. On 64-bit systems, a value of length greater than 0x80000000 will be converted to a valid int because an int value is larger than 32 bits. After the conversion, the value will be safely ignored in favor of `len(ignored)`, which is 4096. On 32-bit systems, however, this value will pass the initial positivity check, but will then become negative when converted to a 32-bit int. This negative value will be seen as the smaller of the two values by `min`, leading it to be used as an array bound and therefore the panic.\r\n\r\nThe code shown below attempts to decode a clearly invalid PNG image, but panics instead of returning an error on 32-bit systems:\r\n```go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n\t\"bytes\"\r\n\t\"fmt\"\r\n\t\"image/png\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tdata := []byte{0x89, 0x50, 0x4e, 0x47, 0x0d, 0x0a, 0x1a, 0x0a, 0xff, 0xff,\r\n\t\t0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0x06, 0xf4, 0x7c, 0x55, 0x04, 0x1a,\r\n\t\t0xd3, 0x11, 0x9a, 0x73, 0x00, 0x00, 0xf8, 0x1e, 0xf3, 0x2e, 0x00, 0x00,\r\n\t\t0x01, 0x00, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0x07, 0xf4, 0x7c, 0x55, 0x04, 0x1a,\r\n\t\t0xd3}\r\n\t_, e := png.Decode(bytes.NewReader(data))\r\n\tif e != nil {\r\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Got error: %s\\n\", e)\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"That should have been an error!\\n\")\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```",
