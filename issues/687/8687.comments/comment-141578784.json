	"body": "The units probably are multiples of 100 ns. However the wakeups (unless the event you wait on is signaled) are done by the scheduler which runs on the timer interrupt. So, if you specify 100 us then the function either has to return immediately (round down) or on the next timer interrupt (round up). That's the fundamental problem. If you lower the timer interval to 0.5 ms then you still get longer sleeps than desired, and wasted electricity.\r\n\r\nYes, Windows needs nanosleep. But it don't got it.\r\n\r\n@alexbrainman if you record an ETW trace (see UIforETW link above) I'll analyze it.",
