It was introduced as part of\npprof implementation\n\nchangeset:   9786:9c5c0cbadb4d                           \nuser:        Hector Chu \u0026lt;hectorchu@gmail.com\u0026gt;            \ndate:        Sat Sep 17 17:57:59 2011 +1000              \nsummary:     runtime: implement pprof support for windows\n\nbut I view it as \"windows timer precision is very very low (about 15ms) comparing to\nother OSes, so lets get best precision whenever we can (1ms)\".\n\ntimeBeginPeriod has many problems. It does not work on some systems (it does not work on\nmy oldish windows xp). I suspect, it fails, if you don't have correct access rights on\nthe system (it works for administrator). When successfully set timeBeginPeriod will\ndrain laptop batteries faster (I read about it everywhere, I didn't have chance to\nexperience it on practice). But, I suspect, many other applications call timeBeginPeriod\ntoo, so Go is not the only one at fault here.\n\nPersonally I don't care if timeBeginPeriod is set, but others might feel different.\nPerhaps there is case here for some way to control it from within Go program.\nALternatively, people who care, can just remove timeBeginPeriod call in their own\nruntime.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
