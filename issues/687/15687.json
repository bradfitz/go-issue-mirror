	"body": "Forked from #14982 - that issue was originally about adding both a BPF and an eBPF package to x/net.\r\n\r\nAfter researching eBPF more, the virtual machine is _very_ different and more complex, so it makes sense to track the work for eBPF separately from the relatively simple BPF stuff.\r\n\r\nMain documentation for eBPF is at https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/filter.txt , although it's described as a diff from \"classic\" BPF, which is really not a helpful way to specify a machine.",
