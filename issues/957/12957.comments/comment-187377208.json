It expects the 64 bytes token to come in a single TLS record, which is a bug.\r\n\r\nGo's `crypto/tls` [breaks up the first write for SSLv3/TLSv1](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/5dc053b9dec4dc25fac195065ad32462ac28a543/src/crypto/tls/conn.go#L895-L913) in two records, as a BEAST mitigation. Heroku's rendezvous service shouldn't care about how many records data has been split into and should properly detect boundaries of the 64 bytes token.\r\n\r\nI think it is safe to close this.",
