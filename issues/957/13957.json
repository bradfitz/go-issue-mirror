	"body": "As far as I know, http2 clients multiplex multiple requests on the same http2 connection.\r\nTo test this scenario I created a simple http2 client and server (listed bellow) using go1.6-beta2.\r\nThe server handler prints the request.RemoteAddr to ensure that the client is using the same host:port. Until then everything seemed to work properly because all log messages prints the same host and port.\r\nBut when I capture the network packets (or just run netstat) I see different client ports in use. The client does not seem multiplexing on the same TCP socket.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I'm missing something or if this is a real issue.\r\n\r\nClient - http://play.golang.org/p/oKBRCXGbOL\r\nServer - http://play.golang.org/p/AmG6J9qRBv\r\n\r\n",
