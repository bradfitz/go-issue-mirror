Alternatively, there's github.com/cespare/prettybench which adds some\nother improvements to the output as well as fixing the alignment.\n\nAlso I don't understand how \"periodically flushing the output\" is supposed to work. If\nyou want all columns to line up properly, you need to buffer the entire output. If you\nflush periodically, you will constantly change the alignment.\n\nI feel like streaming output is far more valuable than perfect alignment.\u003c/pre\u003e",
