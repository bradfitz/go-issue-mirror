The test binary\nknows up front the names of all the benchmarks that it will run, and it could provide\nample padding to allow for long run times.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure it is worth the extra code. It is very easy to borrow some code\nfrom benchcmp (\u003ca href=\"http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/benchcmp)\"\u003ehttp://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/benchcmp)\u003c/a\u003e to parse the\noutput, which you can then reformat to your heart's content, including sorting by\nbenchmark times to see the relative ordering.\n\nWhatever we do, let's keep streamed results. Streamed results let you see progress as it\nhappens. For example, the math/big package has 133 benchmarks. It is useful to see that\nindividual benchmarks are completing in a reasonable time instead of waiting several\nminutes to find out what has happened. It is also useful to be able to peek at the first\nfew results to see whether to let the rest of the benchmarks run.\u003c/pre\u003e",
