	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eOne of my users had a series of crashes from a nil pointer dereference deep in the\nnet/http package. Since it's in a separate goroutine, it brings down the whole process.\n\nI can't figure out where this nil pointer is coming from. Apparently it is the reader\ninside the bufio.Reader.\n\nIs there a good place to put a nil pointer check in the net/http code so that the user\ngets an error instead of a panic?\n\nI'm attaching the panic message.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/6780/0/errors.log\"\u003eerrors.log\u003c/a\u003e (803900 bytes)",
