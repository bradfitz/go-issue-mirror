My program outputs this:\r\n```\r\n2015/08/28 10:08:21 os.IsNotExist is false\r\nexit status 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you see something completely different? Would you mind providing your screen output? you can use mouse to select required portion of your screen and clipboard to capture it. Alternatively you can press PrintScreen key to get a picture.\r\n\r\nAlex",
