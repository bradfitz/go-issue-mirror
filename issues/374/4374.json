Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Set time zone to UTC+1 Amsterdam, Berlin, etc, in Windows 7\n2. Use the Go time package to print current time zone\n3. \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/HW9O172Hnh\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/HW9O172Hnh\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nCET 3600\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nWEST 3600\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows 7\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n1.0.3\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nOn my FreeBSD system it gives back CET 3600 as expected, so it seems to be\nWindows-specific.\nHere's a screenshot of my time zone settings (in Stockholm), \u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Xzl9f.png\"\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/Xzl9f.png\u003c/a\u003e\nAs time zones go, WEST is particularly strange considering today is Nov 12 and summer\ntime ended two weeks ago, so there should currently be nowhere on the planet still it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
