See that io.Copy takes a Writer and a Reader\n3. Wonder what those types are, have to ctrl+F the page for what Writers and Readers\nare, or load other pages and ctrl+F to find out\n\nIt could be nice if the \u0026quot;Writer\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Reader\u0026quot; strings in the\narguments were links to the Writer and Reader interfaces further down the page (e.g.,\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer)\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer)\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThis seems fairly straightforward at first for arguments in the same package, and not\nmuch harder for other packages in the standard library. Anything that's too complicated\nto link to could just revert to the current behavior and not be linked.\n\nThis could also be expanded to include super-interfaces of defined interfaces, e.g.\ntype ReadCloser interface {\n    Reader  // link to #Reader\n    Closer  // link to #Closer\n}\n\nThese links would help users navigate documentation quicker, and would have nearly no\nother effect on the readability of the documentation if the links were invisible until\nhovered over.\u003c/pre\u003e",
