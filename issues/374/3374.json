I've attached a source file with 4 test cases,\nin which cases 1 and 3 fail, but 2 and 4 succeed. I haven't been able to find in\ndocumentation why this would be the case.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Run the attached file which specify the test cases.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nI would expect all four cases to succeed in returning valid durations.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nCases 1 and 3 fail, while cases 2 and 4 succeed.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nTested on Mac OS X and Ubuntu Linux (64-bit)\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n3cdba7b0650c weekly/weekly.2012-03-13\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\n\n\nLet me know if I can provide any further information or if I'm missing something here.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3374/0/duration.go\"\u003eduration.go\u003c/a\u003e (423 bytes)",
