Turns out\nthis is Microsoft's way of referring to CET, I guess? Running \"tzutil /g\" at the command\nprompt gives me \"W. Europe Standard Time\", whatever the hell that is.\n\nWikipedia's only entry on WEST (as time zone) is\n\u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_European_Summer_Time\"\u003ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_European_Summer_Time\u003c/a\u003e and these are apparently not\nthe same thing, hence my confusion. I guess the issue isn't an issue with Go so much as\nwith Windows.\n\nSorry to bother you!\u003c/pre\u003e",
