This is NOT a bug.\nAt line #122, it is expected that RemoveAll(path) will fail, because Chmod(dpath, 0)\nis called previously and nobody, except root, can remove subdirectory `dpath`.\n\nThe reason why all.bash failed is that I ran all.bash as root.\nWhen I ran all.bash as a normal user, installation successfully completed.\n\nThank you.\u003c/pre\u003e",
