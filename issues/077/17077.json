	"body": "It seems like the code for parsing hosts in `net/url` - the parseHost method:\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/url/url.go#L540\r\n\r\ncould invoke the `net/SplitHostPort` method instead:\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/ipsock.go#L109\r\n\r\nIs the separate `parseHost` done for performance optimization reasons, or was this just an oversight? If the former, maybe the code would benefit from a comment explaining this (and referencing the other method).",
