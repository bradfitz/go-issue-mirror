	"body": "There are several default window settings in `transport.go`:\r\n```go\r\n\t// transportDefaultConnFlow is how many connection-level flow control\r\n\t// tokens we give the server at start-up, past the default 64k.\r\n\ttransportDefaultConnFlow = 1 \u003c\u003c 30\r\n\r\n\t// transportDefaultStreamFlow is how many stream-level flow\r\n\t// control tokens we announce to the peer, and how many bytes\r\n\t// we buffer per stream.\r\n\ttransportDefaultStreamFlow = 4 \u003c\u003c 20\r\n\r\n\t// transportDefaultStreamMinRefresh is the minimum number of bytes we'll send\r\n\t// a stream-level WINDOW_UPDATE for at a time.\r\n\ttransportDefaultStreamMinRefresh = 4 \u003c\u003c 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n`NewClientConn` method will use these without looking up other places. However, these default values are not suitable for all situations like high-latency high-throughput network.\r\n\r\nCan you provide some setters to change these values instead of rewrite the whole thing using `Framer` or forking and rewriting this repo?",
