	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eAs of af69687727e7, the spdy library doesn't support turning off header compression. The\nvariable headerCompressionDisabled does exist on spdy.Framer, but it's just not exposed.\n\nIt also seems that some code for detecting when compression should not be used in the\nreader. I can get the ReadFrame method to crash on uncompressed data.\u003c/pre\u003e",
