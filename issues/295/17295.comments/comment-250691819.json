	"body": "QueryRow, like the Query and Exec methods, does not close connections, but puts them back into a connection pool once you are done with the result (in the case of QueryRow, this means calling the Scan method on the result Row). Other queries can than use a connection from the pool, if there is any, to avoid creating new connections (which can take some time). See the documentation for [sql.DB](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#DB).\r\n\r\nYou can limit the number of idle connections in the pool by using [SetMaxIdleConns](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#DB.SetMaxIdleConns), limit the maximum number of open connections with [SetMaxOpenConns](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#DB.SetMaxOpenConns) and use [SetConnMaxLifetime](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#DB.SetConnMaxLifetime) to limit the lifetime of connections (note that this method does not guarantee that connections are closed immediately).",
