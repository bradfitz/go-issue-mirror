	"body": "(Possibly related to #10688 somehow?)\r\n\r\nI'm experiencing flickering/jittery-ness/screen tearing on GL rendering that doesn't use debug.DrawFPS (which strangely fixes it, not sure why). It feels like DrawFPS is somehow enabling double buffering or vsync that is otherwise not there, but I can't figure out why/how that might be the case. Sorry I'm not very experienced with OpenGL.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can reproduce it in [mobile/example/basic](https://github.com/golang/mobile/tree/master/example/basic) with these two changes:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-       gl.Uniform4f(color, 0, green, 0, 1)\r\n+       gl.Uniform4f(color, 0, 0, 0, 1)\r\n...\r\n-       debug.DrawFPS(c)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure why the color needs to be fixed in the above example to reproduce.\r\n\r\nI originally noticed this in a [somewhat more complex spinning cube example](https://github.com/shazow/gomobile-examples) which jitters when `debug.DrawFPS(c)` is not used.
