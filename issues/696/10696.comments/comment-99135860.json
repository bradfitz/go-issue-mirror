For one thing, as you point out, changing it would break Docker, and we certainly aren't going to do that in the pursuit of an abstract consistency.\r\n\r\nI think the only open question is whether we should change runtime.Func.Entry to not crash when Func is nil, for consistency with Name.  I think the relevant difference is that for Name there is an obvious value to return for a nil Func: the empty string.  For Entry we could invent an error value, such as 0, but there is no similarly obvious error value.  At least, I don't find it obvious.\r\n\r\nSo I think in the absence of some reason to change, things are OK as they are.",
