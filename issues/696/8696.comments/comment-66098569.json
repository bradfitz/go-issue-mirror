Since cgocallback_gofunc appears on the G stack, we\nneed to provide funcdata for it, so the copier knows how to copy the frame.  It's\ntrivial for this function, but the funcdata has to be there.\n\nSame with asmcgocall and asmcgocall_errno.\n\nI'll look at this today.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @randall77._",
