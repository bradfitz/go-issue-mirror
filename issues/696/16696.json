	"body": "Currently, `httputil.ReverseProxy` [hardcodes the HTTP/1.1 protocol](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/6a6c1d9841a1957a2fd292df776ea920ae38ea00/src/net/http/httputil/reverseproxy.go#L182) in requests going to the backend service. It would be nice if it could support HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nThat hardcoding seems to have been around since the beginning of reverseproxy.go's existence, so I'm not sure if there are real constraints such that ReverseProxy can't be allowed to use the usual net/http HTTP protocol version detection or if this was just some dregs.",
