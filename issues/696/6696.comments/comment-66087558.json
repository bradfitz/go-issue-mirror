Consider that a application depends on\nmultiple packages that use swig to each wrap an external C++ library; when building the\napplication you would have to specify -swigflags and pass in each package's\nheader/library dependencies?\n\nI think a better approach might be to use something like CGO does with it's 'magic'\n\"#cgo CFLAGS: foo\" and \"#cgo LDFLAGS: foo\" (only adapted for swig) because then compiler\nand linker flags could be set per-package and it would be less tedius.\n\nI'm not sure that -swigflags would really have any benifits over the example workaround\nfrom the OP.\n\nStephen\u003c/pre\u003e",
