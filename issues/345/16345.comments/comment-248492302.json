So far existence of `/etc/resolvers` is the first obvious cgo fallback condition.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm more unsure of is this bit in the [darwin resolver(5) man page](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/resolver.5.html):\r\n\r\n\u003e However, client configurations are not limited to file storage. The implementation of the DNS multi-client search strategy may also locate client configuratins in other data sources, such as the System Configuration Database.  Users of the DNS system should make no assumptions about the source of the configuration data.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with what those other data sources might be or if we can detect their use.\r\n\r\nIssues like https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/19 suggest `scutil` can be used to discover DNS config in the System Configuration Database. Would that give enough hints on when cgo should be preferred? Would it work for all Go-supported OS X versions?\r\n\r\nThere might also be special names that should prefer cgo.\r\n\r\nAny available insight on these things would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nAnd if it would help get things started to open a CL removing the blanket darwin exclusion but falling back to cgo if `/etc/resolvers` exists I can certainly do that.",
