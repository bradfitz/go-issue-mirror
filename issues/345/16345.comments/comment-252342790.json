Use of `port` would trigger [setting unknownOpt](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/964639cc338db650ccadeafb7424bc8ebb2c0f6c/src/net/dnsconfig_unix.go#L118) on the config but the `nameserver` form will need consideration.\r\n* [like OpenBSD](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/964639cc338db650ccadeafb7424bc8ebb2c0f6c/src/net/conf.go#L140), I don't think OS X has any notion of nsswitch.conf so the condition there should probably be expanded or reworked",
