In fact, I think\nwe'd better\nremove the task port code as well when building the release binary. (add a\nTODO for cmd/gomobile?)\n\nThere is a way to install the task_port for foreign threads, because that\ntest\nwant to test that recover on foreign threads can still recover from SIGSEGV,\nwe can do the task_port installation at cgocallback time when we detected\nthat we're being called on a foreign thread.\n",
