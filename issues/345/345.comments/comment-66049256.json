The \ndns parse function in the net package should open and read resolv.conf and pick up \nthe changes when you first attempt to make the connection.  \n\nYou could also try this in resolv.conf:\noptions attempts:5 timeout:10\n\nThat will set the timeout to 10s for each attempt.  \n\nI did some playing and on my net it seems that once every so often the UDP packet to \nthe DNS port is dropped (no response) which generates a retry or the error if I \ndon't have retries turned on. \n\n\nMaybe something else is going on; sorry for the red herring if that's the case.\u003c/pre\u003e",
