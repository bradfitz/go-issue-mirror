My current \nnetwork environment is wireless connectivity to a NetGear router.  \n\nI believe that the cause is occasional slow router response (\u003e 1s). The default (pkg/\nnet/dnsconfig.go) is to make one attempt with a timeout of 1s.  I added the \nfollowing line to /etc/resolv.conf to force multiple retries -- this seems to have \neliminated these messages though I haven't done more than just a bit of testing. \n\noptions attempts:5\u003c/pre\u003e",
