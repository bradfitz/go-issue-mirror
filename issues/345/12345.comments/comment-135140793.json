Interested parties can always get\nfrom git.\n\nFor example, future OS releases might complete break\nGo 1.4's net package, but as it's not required for bootstrapping\nGo 1.5+, we won't fix those problems.\n\nThe exception is that if the required change is too big,\nwe can stop supporting that platform in Go 1.4, but I\nthink it's a fairly unlikely event, at least for the near future.\n",
