	"body": "Go garbage collector does not know Go variable(pointer) used in C world. In Go package source code:\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/cgo_unix.go#L47 here is a variable \"hints\" in Go world which is passed into C function getaddrinfo(). Theoretically, is it possible that the address of \"hints\" is invalid due to Go garbage collection?",
