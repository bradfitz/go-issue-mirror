Have a 2Wire router (which is what I believe is causing the problem, but\nmay be wrong)\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nI expect error==nil, but instead error==\u0026quot;dial tcp google.com:80: lookup\ngoogle.com. on 192.168.1.254:53: no answer from server\u0026quot;\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\ncf1a9b1f9bee+ tip\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nSee attached for 4 packets associated with the execution of my test script.\nAlso attached is my test script. It sometimes works, outputting:\n\ngoogle.com:80\nB \u0026lt;nil\u0026gt;\n\nbut then sometimes outputs:\ngoogle.com:80\nB dial tcp google.com:80: lookup google.com. on 192.168.1.254:53: no answer\nfrom server\n\n\n\nI'm pretty sure it's something related to the 2Wire router because both my\nmother and grandmother have one and it appears to be the same issue, and\nnothing else on my computer seems to be experiencing any difficulty (but if\nsomeone can provide some way to test that, I'll be glad to do it. I'm not\ncompletely ruling out some problem with the computer).\n\nThe router doesn't even seem to respond several google.com queries, but it\nresponds right away to the incorrect google.com.gateway.2wire.net.\n\nThanks, if any more information is needed, just ask.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/345/0/packets.txt\"\u003epackets.txt\u003c/a\u003e (5198 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/345/0/dialing.go\"\u003edialing.go\u003c/a\u003e (162 bytes)",
