But implementing this for each and every query with previously unknown\ncolumns seems error prone and dubious.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\ndatabase/sql.Rows.Columns \nWhat is the expected output?\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\n\nWhich version are you using?
