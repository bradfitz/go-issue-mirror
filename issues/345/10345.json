	"body": "Somewhat related to issue #9477 \"runtime: Large maps cause significant GC pauses\".\r\nIn 1.0 release data and bss sections were split into 4K blocks for GC scanning. This improved parallelism of GC. This optimization was lost during GC precision changes.\r\nNow with concurrent GC splitting of large blocks makes even more sense, it improves not only parallelism but also incremental properties of GC when GOMAXPROCS=1.\r\nWe should split data/bss sections and large heap blocks into X KB blocks and queue them separately.\r\n ",
