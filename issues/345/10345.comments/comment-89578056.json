It has some interesting\ninteractions with the multi-module work being done. As soon as we get a\nreal world use case its priority will increase.\n\nGOMAXPROCS=1 is a broken concept when you try and extend it to include GC\nthreads. GOMAXPROCS=1 should refer only to Ps running mutator (application)\ncode. Single HW threaded machines use cases should not drive Go semantics.\nIf there is another use case I'd be interested to understand how it can\ntell that the GC is running on another core.\n\n\nOn Sat, Apr 4, 2015 at 5:09 AM, Dmitry Vyukov \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e @rsc \u003chttps://github.com/rsc\u003e @RLH \u003chttps://github.com/RLH\u003e @aclements\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/aclements\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/10345#issuecomment-89532963\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
