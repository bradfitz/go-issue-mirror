	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eJust a simple complaint. Since linux's syscall package has Termios struct, is there a\nreason why it doesn't exist on darwin as well (or other OSes with similar terminal\nmechanics)?\n\nAnother issue is ioctl's TIOCGWINSZ which uses 'struct winsize', I was thinking if\nTermios struct is defined, why can't we define Winsize as well?\u003c/pre\u003e",
