I wouldn't want to spend most of the CPU time for cgo. Implementing a gl command-buffer (same principle that Chromium uses) to remove the overhead would be one possibility - and something that rest of people could significantly benefit from.\r\n\r\nWhole viewer will only need simple primitives: rect, line, bezier, triangle, text, bitblt, maskblt, alphablend. Implementing such canvas in Go is mostly trivial, since content should be pixel-aligned anyways and we don't have to worry about aliasing that much (with the exception of bezier and triangle).\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
