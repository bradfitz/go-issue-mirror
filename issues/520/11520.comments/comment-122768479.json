I would like to make it such that it can visualize 1M events with 30FPS while streaming them in. Basically you should be able to view some portion of the trace live while program is emitting it.\r\n\r\n\u003e impression that I got is that making changes to trace-viewer is a very slow process. \r\n\r\nPartly, yes, partly, no... I.e. someone working full time would probably get the patches, features much faster in than I. For me there's a quite large context switch to modify it and I am able, at best, to take 0.5 day from week to work on it.",
