	"body": "After thinking about it, the core of the trace-viewer isn't complicated, and decided to put together a quick prototype in JS: https://github.com/egonelbre/trace-spector\r\n\r\nThis version can load the large file and can be improved with regards to memory usage (currently stabilizes at ~0.5GB with 1.5M events). Currently, trace-viewer AFAIK uses at least one object per event which means 1.5M objects. But I have a feeling that no matter how far we engineer it, the trace-viewer-format based solution is not going to be sufficient for Go traces. I think we should be able to do much better by pre-processing and packing.\r\n\r\nEssentially, we are hitting the browser limit rather than anything else. I think using Go + SDL/GL (whatever) would be better.\r\n\r\nI'll try to finish up the nanoseconds support in trace-viewer, I think it will be sufficient ATM.  Once I have some time left over from other things I'll start on the go based trace inspector (unless someone already beats me to it). And by no means it will be as feature-complete as trace-viewer. And no promises this happening any time soon, I'm already hitting my daily limit with regards to typing too much.",
