I\r\n\u003e think using Go + SDL/GL (whatever) would be better.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to do like (say) Google maps and drop\r\ndetail when zoomed out. It'd make zooming expensive where it is now\r\ncheap, but then in theory you should be able to hand arbitrary traces.\r\n\r\nMy main concern at this point, though, is to make sure that folks'\r\ninitial perceptions of the tracing tool are positive, since initial\r\nreactions are hard to change. That might just be a matter of getting\r\nthe messaging right.\r\n\r\nSince you're versed in the guts of the trace-viewer, maybe it's worth\r\nadding a simple check in the trace viewer to replace the current crash\r\nwith a \"trace too big\" alert? (We should also fix 'go tool trace', of\r\ncourse, but redundant error checking is ok.)\r\n",
