	"body": "Tested with `go version go1.5.2 darwin/amd64`.\r\n\r\nI'm reading the documentation for `json.Indent`:\r\n\r\nhttps://godoc.org/encoding/json#Indent\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this part:\r\n\r\n\u003e The data appended to dst does not begin with the prefix nor any indentation, and **has no trailing newline**, to make it easier to embed inside other formatted JSON data.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't always seem to be the case. Depending on whether the input has a trailing newline, so does the output. Here's a quick reproduce program:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/bSoN4Tl2q_\r\n\r\nIf I understood the documentation and the output correctly, does this mean there's a bug in `json.Indent`?\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Sorry, I accidentally used the word \"encode\" a few times instead of \"indent\". That was a typo, now fixed.",
