Remote schemas are tried when repoRootForImportPath() (whic doesn't return an error despite not finding anything...)\n 2. No result? Then it must be the first element in $GOPATH\n 3. Call vcs.create() on the folder to import the package. As it expects it to be a local package, the remote path is prefixed by $GOPATH[0]. In the case of GIT, the clone-command exits with status 128, thus making go get fail as a whole.\n\n\nOn a side note, get.go's downloadPackage() has a code (roughly) on the form\n\n  if x != \"\" {\n    ...\n  } else {\n    ...\n  }\n  if x == \"\" {\n    ...\n  }\n\nwhich looks like the else and second if-statement should be catenated together.
