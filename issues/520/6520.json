Run go get -x 127.0.0.1/foo.git\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe output of the two commands should match (except hostname/ip difference).\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe command that fetches from localhost fails (unrecognized import path), while the one\nthat explicitly gets the loopback IP succeeds.\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version devel +664c8763de42 Tue Oct 01 11:24:24 2013 +1000 linux/amd64\n\nThis also breaks imports from file-system paths, ie\n\n    \u0026gt; go get shared/go/foo.git\n\nEven though it works with a dot in the base name:\n\n    \u0026gt; go get -x shared.dot/go/foo.git\n    ...\n    git clone shared.dot/foo/foo /home/$USER/Source/go/src/shared.dot/foo/foo.git\n\n(Go get clearly tries to fetch from the file-system too, where having a dot in the path\nisn't all that usual.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
