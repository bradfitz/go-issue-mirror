In the net package, a dumb and small\nbump-in-api feature translates so, because we thought that it's ridiculous we must use\nIPv6 textual address representation when we want to run tcp over dual IP stack on the\npassive-open side. For now any of the following enables \"tcp over dual IP stack on the\npassive-open side\" if possible.\n\ntcp + \":port\"\ntcp + \"0.0.0.0:port\"\ntcp + \"[::]:port\"\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
