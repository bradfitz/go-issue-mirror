Pattern `./` doesn't match `BenchmarkLoop`.\n\n#4: You're not providing a (benchmark's name) pattern, instead (unescaped/naked) `*` is\nexpanded by the shell to a list of all file names in cwd. I.e. the first one listed was\nused as a (non matching) pattern.\n\n#5: Now the regexp is correct (`.` matches BenchmarkLoop). Alternative examples which\nshould work: `go test -bench B`, `go test -bench Loop`. No need for the `./` if the\n*_test.go files are in cwd.\n\nSuggesting to close w/ \"Working as inteded\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
