	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThere is a circular dependency between runtime/race and cmd/cgo in -race build.\nEverything depends on runtime/race, but runtime/race is a cgo package.\nCurrently it's resolved by a hack in go tool:\n\n\t// If we are not doing a cross-build, then record the binary we'll\n\t// generate for cgo as a dependency of the build of any package\n\t// using cgo, to make sure we do not overwrite the binary while\n\t// a package is using it.  If this is a cross-build, then the cgo we\n\t// are writing is not the cgo we need to use.\n\tif goos == runtime.GOOS \u0026amp;\u0026amp; goarch == runtime.GOARCH \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !buildRace {\n\nWe pretend that packages do not depend on cmd/cgo. But as the result we can overwrite\ncmd/cgo binary while it is used.\n\nA better solution is to make runtime/race to be not dependent on cmd/cgo.\u003c/pre\u003e",
