	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eQuoting from a separate bug report:\n\nI didn't see what the defined behavior of the fmt.printf family of functions should be\nto the format pair %_, where _ is any character not defined as a verb. (This happened as\na result of an unrelated error). Currently the code  in fmt/print.go, lines 1096-1100\nassumes that whatever follows the '%' is a valid verb, and charges ahead. (This might be\nwhat you want to do, but perhaps it should be documented, if so) In the example, text\ngenerated by html/template was inadvertently handed to Fprintf, and gave the somewhat\nunintuitive message as shown.\n\npackage main\n\nimport \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\n\nfunc main() {\n   fmt.Println(fmt.Sprintf(\u0026quot;.%2a%3a4.1%3a29\u0026quot;))\n}\n\ngives\n\n.%a(MISSING)%a(MISSING)4.1%a(MISSING)29\n\nThis could be fixed by skipping over, and emitting the %_, or giving  %a(NOT-VERB)\u003c/pre\u003e",
