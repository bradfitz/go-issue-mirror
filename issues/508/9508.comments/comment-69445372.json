Embedding xml in a docstring and for the sake of a `.go` extension doesn't seem worthwhile.\r\n\r\nHaving an `apk.Manifest` sounds enticing initially but I have a hard time seeing how well that would pan out over time.\r\n\r\nI'd guess things like `android: package` could simply be `mobile: package` barring scenarios where one launches an app on one store and later attempts another store to find the package name is taken. Things like `android: target` likely may not be relevant for a pure go app and would simply default to the minimum target, of which the current case is android-9.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think I'd prefer to see `mobile: fullscreen` and `mobile: package com.foo.app` (or even an implied package name based on import path) over actual imports to enable various characteristics. Then again, if after reviewing all the possibilities, the only thing up for discussion is enabling fullscreen with no discussion for supporting other unstated intentions, then I guess it doesn't matter too much. \r\n\r\nBut, the `mobile: ...` comment style grows with fewer pains I think.",
