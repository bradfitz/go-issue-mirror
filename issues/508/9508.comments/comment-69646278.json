	"body": "@crawshaw So in my head it sounds like you are talking about gomobile having a predefined import to permission/need map (I am easily wrong here).  I would prefer the packages inform gomobile. \r\nWhy infer when you can directly know?\r\n\r\nIf it where per package strings instead of funcs, that could be read without having to build another program.  People seemed to not want go generate doing that despite go test already doing it.\r\n\r\n// unicode \"wrapped present\" (bundle) rune in there\r\nconst MobileIOS🎁 = `\r\nxml/json/simpler\r\ndata format here\r\n`\r\nMaybe does not have to be exported...\r\n\r\nI think the func version would be easiest to write and maintain though, no extra parsers need to be written just one bundle struct per target.\r\n\r\nJust a suggestion.",
