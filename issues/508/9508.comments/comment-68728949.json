But I wish we could infer the minimum set of required permission during build time. For example, since it imports net package eventually, this needs permission to access network. \r\n\r\nScreen orientation if fullscreen deserves a separate configuration import.\r\n\r\nWhat about application/activity attributes such as icon/theme?\r\n\r\nSome apps may require a specific set of screen sizes or hardware features (camera, motion sensors)  so that only users with the right sets of devices can see the app in Play Store. But that's probably not a high priority.\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html",
