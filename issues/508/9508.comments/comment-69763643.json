I wrote goapk, it works for the very basics.\r\nI would write more of it but @crawshaw's apk package and gomobile tool have already gone more in depth than I would have (a good thing).\r\nI wrote pkgface because I thought packages as interfaces was funny but wasn't 100% sure how to actually do it, or if it would be feasible in a tool like this (it is).\r\nI have always seen the packager and go build as separate, but more in the way go install and go build are separate.  goapk also installed, ran and uninstalled the apk with the current adb device, not sure if gomobile should do that though.\r\nI apologize if anyone feels I was attacking their ideas.",
