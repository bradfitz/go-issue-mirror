	"body": "Summary:\r\ngomvpkg should rewrite import comments (https://golang.org/s/go14customimport) next to the package statements (package foo // import \"foo\") \r\n\r\n\u003e What version of Go are you using (go version)?\r\ngo version go1.4.2 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n\u003e What operating system and processor architecture are you using?\r\nOS X 10.10.3\r\n\r\n\u003e What did you do?\r\nMoved a package using gomvpkg:\r\n```\r\nmkdir /tmp/foo \r\nexport GOPATH=/tmp/foo\r\ngo get -u golang.org/x/net/...\r\nmkdir -p $GOPATH/src/go.corp.company.com/x/golang.org/x\r\ngomvpkg -from golang.org/x/net -to go.corp.company.com/x/golang.org/x/net\r\ncd $GOPATH/src/go.corp.company.com/x/golang.org/x/net\r\ngo test -v ./...\r\n```\r\n\u003e What did you expect to see?\r\nAll tests passed.\r\n\r\n\u003e What did you see instead?\r\nLots of errors like this due to the import comments not being rewritten:\r\n```\r\ncan't load package: package go.corp.company.com/x/golang.org/x/net/context: code in directory /tmp/foo/src/go.corp.company.com/x/golang.org/x/net/context expects import \"golang.org/x/net/context\"\r\ncan't load package: package go.corp.company.com/x/golang.org/x/net/dict: code in directory /tmp/foo/src/go.corp.company.com/x/golang.org/x/net/dict expects import \"golang.org/x/net/dict\"\r\ncan't load package: package go.corp.company.com/x/golang.org/x/net/html: code in directory /tmp/foo/src/go.corp.company.com/x/golang.org/x/net/html expects import \"golang.org/x/net/html\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also added a test in my fork which now fails but I believe should succeed:\r\nhttps://github.com/dmitris/tools/compare/custom_import_comments\r\n\r\nFixing the issue would make it easier to use gomvpkg for vendoring instead of third-party tools or custom hacks (Perl / sed scripts etc.).  CC'ing @bradfitz for comments (would be great to try to \"dogfood\" gomvpkg for camlistore vendoring! :smile:  )\r\n\r\nSee https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/8969/ for a related discussion of gomvpkg (in the context of updating the Go FAQ and the current pointer to github.com/kr/goven)",
