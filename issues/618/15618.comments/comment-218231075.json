	"body": "For context, go-fuzz constantly hits recursive template invocations. The simplest case is when template \"foo\" contains {{template \"foo\"}}. I had to filter out all inputs that contain string \"template\". It's a user input error, but it manifests as hard program crash. I hoped that I will be at least tests blocks. But now go-fuzz discovered a way to cause recursion using blocks as well.\r\n\r\nOverriding an existing template with block sounds good.\r\nBut note that it not just overdefines, because it calls the top-level template which looks really bogus.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to trigger recursion using blocks? E.g. if block \"foo\" calls block \"bar\" and vise versa. Or it will fail because bar is not refined yet? If it is not possible to trigger recursion this way then I will be able to test at least blocks.",
