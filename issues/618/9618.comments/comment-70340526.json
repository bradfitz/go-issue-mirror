	"body": "When you do make([].., n) and n is constant, the compiler allocates that storage on the stack.  It then stores a reference to that storage in the slice.  When the slice becomes dead, the compiler does not realize that the underlying stack storage is also dead.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't come up very often in real programs, only because the size is seldom constant.  And there are easy workarounds, the simplest being use 0 for the size and append.\r\n\r\nI'll leave this open for now, but I don't expect anyone to work on it anytime soon.",
