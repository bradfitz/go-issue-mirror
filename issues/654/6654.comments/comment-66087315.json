It should\ncertainly not scan $GOPATH looking for likely candidates, as that is sure to find\nobsolete binaries that cause confusing behavior or worse.\n\nI firmly believe this is a non-issue. For those using binary distributions, the tools\nare installed and this will simply not arise. Moreover, such people will not be\ninstalling individual tools just to have the latest version. That is not how binary\ndistributions are used.\n\nFor those working from source, who are fewer in number, the situation is easy to\nunderstand. Yes, it may cause the occasional confusing moment but that doesn't warrant\nchanging the way installation works, which is focused (for these tools) on the canonical\nsetup of a binary distribution.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
