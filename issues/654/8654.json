	"body": "by **laboger**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI built the go tools were built from the dev.power64 branch of the google code\nrepository with some patches from minux@golang.org.  I built gccgo from trunk gcc trunk.\n\nI ran my testcase on power8 BE \u0026amp; LE machines.\n\nWith gccgo the value for GOARCH on ppc64 and ppc64le machines is 'ppc64'.\n\nWith gc I get the GOARCH values 'power64' on the ppc64 machine and 'power64le' on the\nppc64le machine.\n\n\u0026gt;What does 'go version' print?\n\n~/gowork/go/bin/go version\ngo version devel +be0c14f62257 Mon Aug 18 22:24:15 2014 -0400 linux/power64\n\n~/gowork/go/bin/go version\ngo version devel +be0c14f62257 Mon Aug 18 22:24:15 2014 -0400 linux/power64le\n\n./gccgo --version\ngccgo (GCC) 5.0.0 20140828 (experimental)\nCopyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.

If it isn't then go code which is written to test the GOARCH value could behave\ndifferently with each go compiler.\n\nSince gccgo has been using ppc64 for while now, that seems like the preferred base name\n(instead of just power).\n\nA related question is whether the GOARCH value for powerpc64 BE \u0026amp; LE machines should\nbe the same. I'm stating an opinion on that for now just that however it is set it\nshould be consistent.\u003c/pre\u003e",
