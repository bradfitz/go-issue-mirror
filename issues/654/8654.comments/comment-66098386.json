If you want more details I can ask him to provide\nthem.\n\nRight now we use both ppc64 and powerpc64, so it would be nice not to add another\nvariation.  Also I don't think the fact that it is inconsistent for other platforms is a\nlegitimate reason to make it inconsistent for powerpc64 too.  Seems like you'd want all\nthe GOARCH values to be same for gc and gccgo.\u003c/pre\u003e",
