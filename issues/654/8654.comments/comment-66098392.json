It does not apply to Chips produced by Freescale (e6500) or P.A. Semi (PA6T).\n\nPowerPC was the official name of the Instruction Set Architecture (it is now PowerISA as\nof V2.03) and so applies to ISA complaint chips (includes Freescale and PA Semi)\n\npowerpc[64] and ppc[64] are widely accepted names for the architecture in the GNU/Linux\ncommunity. When generating code you want the architecture name at the top level.\n\npower with a number suffix (ie power7 power8) should only be used to designate a\nspecific POWER server chip (micro-architecture).\u003c/pre\u003e",
