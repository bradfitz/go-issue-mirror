The fact that we have in the past used unusual GOARCH names is not a\nreason to use unusual ones going forward.\n\nThe problem with using different GOARCH values based on endianness is that file names\nbecome awkward.  You can no longer name a file syscall_powerpc64.go, because it will\nonly be used on big-endian, not little-endian.  It's quite normal to want to have build\ntags that are processor-specific.  It's quite unusual, in fact, it never happens, to use\na build tag that is endian-specific.  So why do we want to distinguish endianness in the\nGOARCH value?\u003c/pre\u003e",
