However, 'P' only works when Presenter mode is enabled, by running `present -p` instead of `present`\r\n- Presenter features will run **only** if Presenter mode is enabled, so none of its features (eg. local storage, event listeners) will interfere with the original `present` if that is not the intent\r\n- Instruction for pressing 'P' appears in the terminal logs when `present -p` is run - for informing the speaker\r\n- The slides are loaded onto the Presenter window using an iframe - this retains the layout of the Go present slides, and allows dual syncing triggered by localStorage events, which ensures reliability and speed of the syncing\r\n- Every time the slides are updated on either the Presenter window or main browser window, the latest slide index is stored in localStorage - the event listener catches this and triggers the update in the other window\r\n- The notes are updated on the Presenter window by listening and retrieving the updated slide number stored in localStorage\r\n- Notes are parsed/identified in the backend by prefixing a paragraph with `\"\u0026 \"`. Multiple paragraphs are supported\r\n\r\nNotes/Concerns:\r\n\r\n- Running `.play` actions by clicking on `Run` does not sync in the other window (see [example](https://github.com/audreylim/go-presenter#what-presenter-does-not-do))\r\n- Currently does not display timer, but that can be added (also indicate current slide number)\r\n- The focus was to get this working, so it currently supports only Chrome. Multiple browser support can be investigated/enabled\r\n- This implementation is meant to help speakers primarily, so speaker notes will not be directly available on sites like go-talks.appspot.com for readers/audiences. It works only if run locally as `present -p` can be enabled\r\n- `\"\u0026 \"` is the current syntax for notes, but that can be changed. Maybe (`\"// \"`) or something comment/notes like\r\n- The Presenter window currently displays a sneak preview (one-tenth) of the previous and next slide. If the preference is to view the entire slide, the window width can be changed\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
