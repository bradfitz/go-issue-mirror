It's what it looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u003e some quote goes here\r\n\r\nsome reply goes here\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is also valid Markdown that gets rendered as:\r\n\r\n\u003e some quote goes here\r\n\r\nsome reply goes here\r\n\r\n`-\u003e` prefix does not have this problem as far as I know.\r\n\r\nHowever, I looked at some existing talks, and did not find any usages of this markdown idiom there. The one quote I found was actually written as a quote rather than a blockquote, so maybe `\u003e` is not bad (even if it conflicts with markdown).",
