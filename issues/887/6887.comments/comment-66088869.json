OS-specific restrictions might apply.\nfunc Rename(oldpath, newpath string) error\n\nthree separate changes:\n1. mention \"move\" to clarify things up.\n2. use {old,new}path instead of {old,new}name, which makes it clear what relative path\nwould do here.\n3. mention \"OS-specific restrictions might apply\". I'm open to suggestions on this one,\nbecause\n  I don't think we can list all the OS-specific restrictions without refering to the implementations.\n  And people using it should be aware that we can't make a version that works the same across all\n  supported platforms (such an API is not usable IMO, and it will also changing the current behavior).\u003c/pre\u003e",
