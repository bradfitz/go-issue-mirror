	"body": "The lack of parallelization for compilations within a single package doesn't matter too much when building go files, but does affect cgo compilation. I have a package with about 32k lines of (generated) C++. Compiling it serially takes ~10.5s. A small hack to cmd/go/build.go to compile C/C++/Obj-C files in parallel brings this down to ~3.7s.\r\n\r\nThe patch I hacked together to parallelize cgo compilation work is ~50 lines of deltas and is mostly contained in `builder.cgo()`.\r\n\r\nPS The compilation times above were measured using go 1.4.1 on Mac OS X, but this code hasn't changed at head and similar compilation times can be seen there.",
