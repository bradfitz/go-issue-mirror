Build and run \u003ca href=\"http://pastebin.com/CymKMXja\"\u003ehttp://pastebin.com/CymKMXja\u003c/a\u003e  (io/signal -\u0026gt; exp/signal for default)\n2. Open in web browser \u003ca href=\"http://127.0.0.1:7777\"\u003ehttp://127.0.0.1:7777\u003c/a\u003e\n3. Click \u0026quot;Again\u0026quot; submit button multiple times in quick succession.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe form continuing to appear with running total.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nNo data Received error in browser.\nOn command line:\n2012/02/06 22:55:09 http: panic serving 127.0.0.1:38887: database is locked\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nUbuntu 11.10\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n7c35ab6ef473 tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nProblem doesn't seem to appear with sleep removed, yet should not make a difference as\nDB should not be locked whilst goroutine is sleeping.\nAlso, once DB locks, it is only freed on quitting the program.\nLastly, I've never had it write lock, only read lock.\u003c/pre\u003e",
