	"body": "If you build with `-ldflags -s`, which drops the DWARF information from the executable, then codesign produces a valid binary. I think this is mostly not Go's fault (except that Go works hard to put DWARF info in the binaries, unlike most OS X programs). Certainly for Go 1.5 but possibly long term we can suggest that people who need codesign can use `-ldflags -s`.\r\n",
