I did an updated tester that's a little more flexible if\nit's of any interest; see \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/1q0vrfplVT\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/1q0vrfplVT\u003c/a\u003e (-multi, etc. - repro\nwithout -multi is easy)\n\nrunning with -clients 8 - failure every time\nrunning with -clients 8 -multi -- ran it around 10 times without observed failure\nrunning with _4 separate processes_ -clients 1 - failure in two of four every few runs\n\u0026lt;----------- bad.\n\nIt would be extremely useful if I could coax the runtime to dump (somewhere) the life of\na descriptor especially in terms of epoll activity.  Otherwise time to get systemtap\nworking.. \n\nI'll run an extended duration series of tests to see if I can reproduce it with single\ninstance -multi; probably will not reveal anything worthwhile but it can run by itself.\u003c/pre\u003e",
