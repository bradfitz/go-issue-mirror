In fact, I can't get it to reproduce with\nanything but our full stack test setup:\nhttp load balancer/reverse proxy -\u003e server under test with multiple writers to syslog\nall on the same box \n\nIt only takes about 30s of load testing to make it happen in our test environment so it\nis 100% reproducible under the right conditions.\u003c/pre\u003e",
