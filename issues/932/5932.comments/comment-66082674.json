Using only one connection this\nproblem is harder to reproduce.\n\nThis program has a 100% reproduction rate for me: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/vu12qIyPil\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/vu12qIyPil\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI tried it running at multiple servers, different rsyslog versions, etc. It doesn't\nreally matter if rsyslog is configured to drop (rate-limit) messages or not. Even on a\ntuned rsyslog config this scripts hangs within 10k messages.\n\nI can send milions of messages repeatedly in one goroutine / one syslog conncetion\nwithout problems. Using 2 goroutines / two syslog connections it hangs within 10k\nmessages.\u003c/pre\u003e",
