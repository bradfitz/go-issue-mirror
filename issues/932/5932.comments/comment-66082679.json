That's why\nwe need to do epoll_ctl(EPOLL_DEL) when an fd is closed, while documentation says that\nit's unnecessary.\nI suspect that it's the reincarnation of the same kernel bug, that leads to delivery of\nepoll notification to a random (first?) fd referring to the unixgram socket (even if a\ndifferent fd is actually got EAGAIN). I don't have any evidence, though. But such kernel\nbehavior would explain all hangs that we see.\u003c/pre\u003e",
