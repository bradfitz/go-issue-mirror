I think the correct way of fixing (which is what I\noriginally intended), is to add a n-\u003eorig node when typechecking a \u0026T{} literal. There\nis so much mutation happening afterwards that I don't understand how it can work\notherwise.\n\nI've begun to write \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/7437043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/7437043\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIt needs a bit more polishing and seems to compile juju, but haven't got the time to\nreduce your issue to a small testcase.\u003c/pre\u003e",
