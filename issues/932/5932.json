	"body": "by **swhite@fitstar.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhen writing to a connection created by net.Dial(\u0026quot;unixgram\u0026quot;,\n\u0026quot;/dev/log\u0026quot;) I will occasionally get an EAGAIN returned.  When that happens the\ninternal WaitWrite call will block forever if no deadline is set.  I can break by\nsetting a deadline.  Writing to the connection after the timeout error works so it looks\nlike the WaitWrite is not working properly for this type of socket.  It happens for both\nthe Write and the WriteToUnix calls.\n\nI don't know how to create an EAGAIN from a unixgram type socket so I don't have a test\ncase.  It was very difficult to reproduce this against rsyslog.  I'm hoping a socket\nexpert can figure it out an easy way to reproduce this.\n\nThis bug started on go1.1 and is reproducible on go1.1.1 (never saw it on 1.0.x). \namd64/linux (ubuntu 12.04)\u003c/pre\u003e",
