	"body": "@mwhudson suggested in #15734:\r\n\r\n\u003e If the export data hasn't changed, can you skip the compilation of dependent packages?\r\n\r\nMoving this idea here to be tracked separately.\r\n\r\nMy 2c: Interesting idea, seems worth pursuing. Not sure how often it happens that code changes don't impact export data (or how cheap that is to detect), but when it does happen, that could save a *bunch* of computation.",
