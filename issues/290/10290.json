	"body": "`encoding/base64` decoder input errors are very vague. They only give you a character number while if you look at the code there are comments stating the true reason for each error. Also perhaps if you don't want to return more specific errors you could add the character that was invalid instead of just the number.\r\n\r\nExample from http://golang.org/src/encoding/base64/base64.go\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5204642/6899621/c402eb98-d6cf-11e4-8da6-37faffc4f851.png)\r\n\r\nYou end up with an error message like the following\r\n```\r\nillegal base64 data at input byte 76\r\n```\r\nBut it'd be a lot nicer if we knew why it was illegal.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I should put this on the forums. The issue guidelines don't say anything about requests/suggestions for improvements.",
