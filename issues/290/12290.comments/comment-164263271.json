	"body": "The change does not really improve uniformity that much. Again, as there are more floating points near zero, the outcome will be skewed towards zero with probability 1/2^11.\r\nThe change suggests a confusion in the definition of uniformity. Hitting all floating point numbers with equal probability doe not necessarily mean uniform, because of the over representation of numbers close to zero. So the fix continues the same mistake, just make things on average a bit slower, and will be useless for Quasi random number generators.",
