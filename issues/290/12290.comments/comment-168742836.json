	"body": "@fabienlefloch I disagree. Yes, there are more floating-point numbers near zero, but they are selected less often, so it works out. By \"uniform\" here we mean that after x = rand.Float64(), as much as possible, x \u003c k with probability k, for all k in [0, 1]. I spent a while calculating Pr(x \u003c k) analytically for the various fixes, and the current implementation seems to me quite close, certainly far closer than one in 2^11. I'd be happy to see an analysis disproving that though.",
