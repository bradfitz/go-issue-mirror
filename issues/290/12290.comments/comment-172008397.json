Worse if you try to compute an average with Monte-Carlo, you will need a decent sample size, so it's likely to take way too much time to test naively.\r\nBut if you assume that you have a RNG that gives you 1,2,3,4,5 on one side and 2^63-1,2^63-2,2^63-3,2^63-4,2^63-5 on the other side, you can see that the average number of hits in (0,2^-53] is going to be larger than the number of hits in [1-2^53,1) (actually in this case it's going to fall all in (0,2^-53]).\r\n",
