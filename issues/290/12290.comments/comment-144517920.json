	"body": "I would not worry about not hitting certain FP values, especially since FPs are not uniformly distributed by nature (much more towards 0 than towards 1). What's important is that the FP values generated have a uniform distribution. If you restrict yourself to the 53 bits, then the FP numbers are uniformly spaced in (0,1), so it's easy to grasp that the FP generator has to be uniform if the underlying integer generator is uniform. Yes you loose the small numbers around 0 (less than machine epsilon) but there is no way to be uniform and keep those.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's not a very good argument, but I would trust Matsumoto and the official Mersenne-Twister implementation as he is a very prominent researcher in the area.",
