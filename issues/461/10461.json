	"body": "geom.Width and geom.Height look like they're meant to be initialized once and not mutated afterwards, since they're plain global variables without any locking.\r\n\r\nHowever, x/mobile/app and in particular loop_android.go updates these global vars when e.g. the phone rotates.\r\n\r\nThere is no clear line between the UI goroutine and the others. Should we protect each value or should we restrict them being accessible from the UI goroutine? This is a design question and requires discussion.",
