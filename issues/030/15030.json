	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\ndarwin amd64\r\n\r\n3. \r\nIf not using http's default serveMux, `import _ \"expvar\"` cannot add the appropriate handler for me. The handler added by the [init function](https://golang.org/src/expvar/expvar.go#L305) adds an http handler that does a bit of logic I would like to have. I can make it work a couple of different ways:\r\n\r\n- Copy expvarHandler into my application and attach it to my mux.\r\n- `myMux.Handle(\"/debug/vars\", http.DefaultServeMux)`, which sort of works, but doesn't help me if I want it at another path or anything like this. \r\n\r\nSimply exporting `expvarHandler` would allow me to do `myMux.HandleFunc(\"/whatever/route/I/want\", expvar.Handler)`.\r\n\r\nWould the go team consider a change to that effect?\r\n\r\n",
