It sounds like you think I said the answer is to\npackage up the C functionality you need during your test in some other\npackage and then import that \"external\" package.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that import \"C\" is an implementation detail of the\npackage you are trying to test. The test itself shouldn't need to\nimport \"C\" at all.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
