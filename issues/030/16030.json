	"title": "cmd/go: Documentation for \"import comment\" suggests an impossible comment form.",
	"body": "The documentation of `cmd/go` has a section on [import path checking](https://golang.org/pkg/cmd/go/#hdr-Import_path_checking) that currently says:\r\n\r\n\u003e A package statement is said to have an \"import comment\" if it is immediately followed (before the next newline) by a comment of one of these two forms:\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e     package math // import \"path\"\r\n\u003e     package math /* import \"path\" * /\r\n\r\nNote the space in the closing `* /`. What the documentation is _trying_ to say is actually `*/`, but due to a [technical limitation](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/fee02d270bf850d5b390000d8545c3609718e9a5/src/cmd/go/mkalldocs.sh#L9) it says something else instead. The problem is that including a `*/` inside the package comment would end it short, causing `alldocs.go` file to have syntax errors:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/fee02d270bf850d5b390000d8545c3609718e9a5/src/cmd/go/alldocs.go#L1268\r\n\r\nThe end result is that documentation (specification) of import comments can be confusing, especially for beginners. The documentation should be truthful and say:\r\n\r\n\u003e ... a comment of one of these two forms:\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e     package math // import \"path\"\r\n\u003e     package math /* import \"path\" */\r\n\r\nI propose fixing this by using line comments rather than general comments (also known as block comments) for the generated documentation in `alldocs.go`. Line comments scale better and can include any characters. General comments cannot contain `*/` character sequence.\r\n\r\nI have it implemented, I will submit a CL that resolves this soon.",
