I'm actually curious why an array was used at all, instead of a slice\ninitialized to a smaller value and autoexpanding as necessary.\n\nIf that would be a valid solution, I could try writing a patch although I'll freely\nadmit I remember practically nothing about the representation of floating point values,\nand it'll be a learning experience for me. As far as I can tell, should be pretty simple\njust converting to a slice representation and changing to appends where necessary.\n\nSanjay\u003c/pre\u003e",
