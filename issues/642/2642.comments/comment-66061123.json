Is it CL\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/5503085/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/5503085/\u003c/a\u003e ? \n\nIn this CL I suggest using a *small* buffer in some cases, while still allowing for the\n800-byte buffer. It is a bit ugly, but thanks to escape analysis, both are on the stack,\nbut only the one that comes into scope is zeroed (and zeroing 800 bytes is a significant\nportion of the call).\n\nHowever, escape analysis must be improved for this to work, which is proposed in CL\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/5489128/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/5489128/\u003c/a\u003e . It would be great if you could have a look at\nit, because I think it could have benefits in other places.\u003c/pre\u003e",
