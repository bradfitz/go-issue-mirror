	"body": "I close this issue for the following reasons.\r\n\r\n1. A glibc bug described in #6336 has been fixed in glibc-2.20 and beyond.\r\n2. In go1.4, the internal lookup function lookupIPDeadline has been fixed in the case of slow simultaneous query-response exchanges. It is used by both CGO_ENABLED=1 and CGO_ENABLED=0 lookup functions.\r\n3. In go1.4, built-in DNS stub resolver (which is enabled when CGO_ENABLED=0) has been improved in the case of simultaneous query-response exchanges.\r\n\r\nIn addition, go1.4 has a test case that is able to invoke simultaneous query-response exchanges.\r\n```\r\ncd $GOROOT/src/net\r\ngo test -v -run=TestLookupIPDeadline -dnsflood\r\n```\r\nPlease try it for troubleshooting, when you have a question with regard to DNS behavior within dial, lookup APIs.",
