	"body": "I do see the utility here, but I don't think it's compelling enough. Some APIs want to exclude unsigned integers (encoding/binary). Others want to exclude Uintptr (database/sql). And functions returning bool won't fit well into existing switch statements on the kind. The status quo is a bit verbose, but reflect in general is a bit verbose. That's not a completely terrible thing if it discourages overuse. There are also the usual concerns about client code only working with Go 1.6 or later just because it uses a trivial helper.\n\nOn balance I think we should leave things as they are.",
