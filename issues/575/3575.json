	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe attached source file reproduces the issue, by simply calling LookupHost in a loop,\nin a few hundred goroutines.\n\nIt seems to be related to performing a large number of (concurrent?) DNS requests, and\nlocalhost is not the only host name it happens on. It just highlights the fact that\nsomething is not quite right. In my case, it happened with a basic web crawler which\nmakes a lot of concurrent requests, and eventually it would fail to connect to a local\nDB, or any other host.\n\nThis was tested on Mac OS X Lion, using the binary release of Go1.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3575/0/main.go\"\u003emain.go\u003c/a\u003e (238 bytes)",
