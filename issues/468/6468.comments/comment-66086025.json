But if you pass a value x, which cannot have its address\ntaken, then the rewrite is not possible and json.Marshal cannot invoke the\nMarshalJSON method. I have tested that after Brad's recent fix your\nplayground snippet behaves the same way at tip as it did in Go 1.1.\n\nThe behavior in JSON matches what Go does:\n\nfunc Ptr() *Foo\nfunc Value() Foo\n\nfunc _() {\n    Ptr().Str.MarshalJSON()\n    Value().Str.MarshalJSON()\n}\n\nillustrates the difference.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
