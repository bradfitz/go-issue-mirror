I don't think we should redefine what\nStackSys/StackInuse mean to be different than the other Sys/Inuse pairs. In particular\nthe sum of all the XxxSys fields needs to match the Sys field.\n\nMaybe instead we can add a new field that counts total stack usage? Maybe just\nStackAlloc.\n\nIt's fine for Go 1.3 if this is a noninvasive change.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.3maybe**, removed **release-go1.3**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
