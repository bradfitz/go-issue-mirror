We also have http.Redirect, which assumes that Request.URL.Path is\nabsolute.\n\nThus, if one tries to use http.Redirect within a handler that is wrapped in\nhttp.StripPrefix the redirect will point to a wrong URL. In fact, we don't use\nhttp.Redirect in http.FileServer for this very reason:\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/net/http/fs.go#339\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/net/http/fs.go#339\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWe could abandon StripPrefix and have another way of passing the prefix to handlers. We\ncould also keep the original path and the possibly-shortened path in request, so that\nredirect could use the original path.\u003c/pre\u003e",
