	"body": "I have a process that when running with GOMAXPROCS=18 spends 7.5% of its CPU cycles in runtime.gcMark -\u003e runtime.freeStackSpans. This work is not parallelized, so the wall clock time spent in runtime.freeStackSpans accounts for significantly more than 7.5% of my program's mark termination times. More details on my program are in #12967, but the gist is that it sees mark termination times well in excess of 10ms while running with 100k goroutines and 500MB of heap.",
