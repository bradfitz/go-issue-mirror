	"body": "I'm trying to make my own LD_PRELOAD-able library like this:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// compile: go build -buildmode=c-shared -o example.so example.go\r\n// tested with Go 1.5 on Ubuntu 15.04 amd64\r\npackage main\r\nimport \"C\"\r\nfunc main() {}\r\n//export dummy\r\nfunc dummy() C.int { return 42 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis `example.so` works well with several simple programs such as `ls`, `cat`, `cp` and so on.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ LD_PRELOAD=./example.so ls\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, some programs such as `firefox`, `google-chrome`, `gdb` get segfault immediately (or sometimes just get hung up).\r\n\r\nI suspect this is a bug of the Go runtime.\r\n\r\nAnyone can please look on this?\r\n\r\nNote that C-implementation seems working well with any program:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n// compile: gcc -Wall -fPIC -shared -o example-c.so example.c\r\nint dummy() { return 42; }\r\n```\r\n",
