The error is happening during the load testing.  Initially we got the error similar like the one described in the issue description(http: proxy error: dial tcp HOSTNAME:PORT can't assign requested address)\r\n\r\nEven after upgrading it to 1.6, the same issue is happening but GO App log shows the below error\r\n\"http: proxy error: net/http: request canceled\"\r\n\r\nI've enabled the DisableKeepAlives and performed the load testing and the same issue is happening, Now Go app shows the below errors.\r\n\r\n http: proxy error: dial tcp HOSTNAME:PORT: i/o timeout\r\n http: proxy error: net/http: request canceled\r\n\r\nSo we have to either call https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Transport.CloseIdleConnections or increase MaxIdleConnsPerHost to some higher value to fix this issue.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any suggestions.",
