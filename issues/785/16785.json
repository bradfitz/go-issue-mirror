What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/-chU68uIbC\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n/first/value:/second/value\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n$ENV1:$ENV2\r\n\r\nI'm working on an example for the \"os\" package to help a little on the issue [16360](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16360).\r\n\r\nAccording to how os.Expand is implemented this is not a bug, but I was expecting that this function would recursively fetch the environment variables in order to expand it.\r\n\r\nIs this a wanted behavior?\r\n",
