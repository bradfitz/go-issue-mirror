Restoring the registers on the way\nout of the signal handler will restore the state.\n\nHowever, if your program is getting signals while the C code is running, that\nwould explain the bad behavior.  The Go runtime assumes its own private data\nis in R14 and R15, but that's not true when calling into C.  Is your code taking\nsignals while running C code?\u003c/pre\u003e",
