	"body": "I just audited the code for ways a DATA frame can go out before the HEADERS but I'm not seeing a way: from the handler's goroutine, `(*responseWriterState).writeChunk` looks fine: `writeHeaders` is called before `writeDataFromHandler` and both call `writeFrameFromHandler` which looks fine and sends on a channel. The sole receiver of that channel (in the server goroutine) also looks fine, calling into the write scheduler (writesched.go) and those add \u0026 push methods look fine too.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this for now until I have something to go on.\r\n",
