Correct me if I am wrong but if you run curl\nlike this:\n\ncurl -vv --header 'Range: bytes=0-5' --header 'Accept-Encoding: gzip'\n'\u003ca href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/square/okhttp/master/README.md\"\u003ehttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/square/okhttp/master/README.md\u003c/a\u003e'\n\nI.e. enforcing gzip there is no content in curl either. I assume it is because the\nserver has to zip the entire content before it sends it and that makes it impossible to\ndecode the little received chunk. Knock, knock.\n\nIf we get a gzip header we wrap a gzipReader innermost in the reader stack (is that the\nproper term, stack?). This reader tries to automatically unzip the payload I guess and\nthen it errors out.\n\nCan that be it? If so it either seems like a harder problem or quite a lot simpler. Just\nskip the wrapped gzipReader and leave it to the caller to assemble and unzip the\nresulting file.\n\nDoes that make sense?\u003c/pre\u003e",
