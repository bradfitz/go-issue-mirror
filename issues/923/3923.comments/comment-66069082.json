Originally I thought it was because of (see example in 3915)\n\nvar c3 mybool = c2 == (x \u0026lt; y) // illegal because x \u0026lt; y is of type bool now\n\nwhich I believe should be legal. The wording in the spec could be clearer - I think we\nshould simply say that the result of a comparison is an untyped boolean (however, that\nwould be the only case where an untyped value is not constant - at least as far as it's\nvisible to a programmer).\n\n- gri\u003c/pre\u003e",
