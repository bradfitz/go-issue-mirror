	"body": "I agree with @minux there is already enough confusion around go build and go test supporting `.go` files vs the recommend use of packages. To allow the go tool to fetch a package that has a _directory_ named `something.go` will just add more confusion to an area newcomers already find difficult.\r\n\r\nThe clincher for me is `package something.go` is not a valid package declaration, so the name of directory cannot match the packages' name.\r\n\r\nI vote to close this as unfortunate.",
