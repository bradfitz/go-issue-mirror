	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Compile attached source that attempts to print the results of waiting on a process\n2. Run the program\n3. See the panic\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\u0026lt;nil\u0026gt;\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nStack trace\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g and 6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n95d2ce135523+ (release-branch.r57) release/release.r57.1\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI think this is because the return value of Wait is a *Waitmsg, and can be null, but the\nString() function is defined on Waitmsg (not a pointer to).  The implicit dereference is\nwhat gets you.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1851/0/waitmsg.go\"\u003ewaitmsg.go\u003c/a\u003e (160 bytes)",
