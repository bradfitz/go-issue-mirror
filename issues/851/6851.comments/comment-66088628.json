This gives everyone a chance to validate the\ndesign, helps prevent duplication of effort, and ensures that the idea fits inside the\ngoals for the language and tools. It also guarantees that the design is sound before\ncode is written; the code review tool is not the place for high-level discussions.\n\nIn short, send mail before you code. And don't start the discussion by mailing a change\nlist!\n\"\"\"\"\n\nNote the last sentence above combined with the fact that the issue is not even accepted\nyet.\u003c/pre\u003e",
