	"body": "In Go 1.6, the HTTP/1 client got Transport.ExpectContinueTimeout.\r\n\r\nThe http2 Transport should do the same. And ideally it should use the configuration value from the *http1.Transport, at least when used via the standard library.\r\n\r\nIssue #13659 is about at least not getting confused by the 100-continue header responses from servers. This bug is about doing it properly.\r\n\r\n/cc @bmizerany\r\n",
