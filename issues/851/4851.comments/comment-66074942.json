It's not any less\nplatform-specific than /dev/null would be and doesn't require any changes. In a way,\nusing /dev/null would be \"too magic\". Go doesn't write to a device, it creates a file,\nso handling /dev/null would be special and not the same meaning as the Unix meaning of\nit.\u003c/pre\u003e",
