That's one of dozen problems SetMaxIdleConns() solved.\r\n\r\nNow I'm not sure adding SetMaxIdleTimeout() improve efficiency dramatically.\r\nBut I'm sure it's add significant complexity to connection pool.\r\n\r\nIs there good benchmark application which lack of SetMaxIdleTimeout cause major efficiency issue?",
