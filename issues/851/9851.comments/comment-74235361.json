Essentially, the gap between MaxOpenConns and MaxIdleConns right now is closed immediately if the connections go idle, i.e. there's a timeout of 0.  What I'd like to see is something which only starts closing idle connections after a non-zero timeout.  So if you want to enforce that no client is kept around idle for more than one minute, you could do:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  db.SetMaxIdleConns(0)\r\n  db.SetMaxReuseTimeout(time.Minute)\r\n  // perhaps set MaxOpenConns to whatever\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the reuse timeout defaults to 0, the interface stays backwards compatible in a nice way.",
