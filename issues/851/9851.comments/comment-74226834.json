But enforcing connection lifetimes isn't a database-specific problem.\r\n\r\n\u003e For example, go-sqlite3 provide way to hook and get driver-native connection like below.\r\n\r\nThis, to me, seems ugly beyond any recognition.  For example, how do you make sure that the connection isn't handed out by database/sql while you're working on the underlying driver-specific handle?\r\n\r\nI think the proper solution would start out something like this: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-dev/RWmOv4SYUmc/discussion",
