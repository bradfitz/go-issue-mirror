So {{.Foo}} would\nresolve to data.Foo if defined and fall back to data.Get(\"Foo\") if implemented. This\nenables custom handling in the Get method and the ability to return an error like method\ncalls. This _could_ remove the need to implement a separate ExecuteStrict for stricter\nhandling although I believe the default behavior should (eventually) be to return an\nerror. The Getter support could just be another feature of the template engine.\u003c/pre\u003e",
