This new behaviour is not documented in the [Go 1.5 Release Notes](http://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.5), which has already [caused some confusion](http://stackoverflow.com/q/32180434/1892060). This should be documented in the release notes (and other build-related documents) along with the rationale for this change.",
