	"body": "After a recent change to libgo/mksysinfo.sh to gccgo to add some of the ioctl constants from if_tun.h, it was discovered that the change could cause the ppc64le or ppc64 build to hang on some systems.  The problem appears to be due to a missing space on some lines that were using grep; when the space is added to those lines the hang no longer occurs.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n-if ! grep '^const TUNGETVNETHDRSZ'${OUT} \u003e/dev/null 2\u003e\u00261; then\r\n+if ! grep '^const TUNGETVNETHDRSZ' ${OUT} \u003e/dev/null 2\u003e\u00261; then\r\n\r\nI have a fix for this.  I'm not sure why it happens on some systems and not others, possibly due to different versions of grep.\r\n\r\n",
