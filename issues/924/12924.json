	"body": "In a pipeline `{{.Foo.Bar}}` where `Foo` field is declared as of type interface `I` and points to a struct `S` that implements `I` and has `Bar` field:\r\n\r\n* `Bar` can be resolved if `I` is `interface{}`\r\n* `Bar` cannot be resolved if `I` is a non-empty interface\r\n\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/Knps5C6aaL\r\n\r\nI think this is inconsistent, `Bar` should be resolvable with non-empty `I`.\r\nThis wasn't catched by tests because there is a test for `interface{}`, but not for a non-empty interface.\r\n\r\nI'd like to work on this.",
