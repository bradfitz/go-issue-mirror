If you can detect a min/max-loop and tune the likeliness of the branch, it would generate better code for the likely case, removing the dependency and improving the results. It would not be the BEST possible result, but it would be uniformly better than what Go 1.7 does and on par with Go 1.6. Exploring usage of maxss is then a separate possible optimization ",
