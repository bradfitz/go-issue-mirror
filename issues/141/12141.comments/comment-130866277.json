	"body": "Here are some other quotes from the time docs:\r\n\r\n\u003e Note that the Go == operator compares not just the time instant but also the Location. Therefore, Time values should not be used as map or database keys without first guaranteeing that the identical Location has been set for all values, which can be achieved through use of the UTC or Local method.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\u003e Two times can be equal even if they are in different locations. For example, 6:00 +0200 CEST and 4:00 UTC are Equal. This comparison is different from using t == u, which also compares the locations.\r\n\r\nThis issue is more or less a duplicate of #10089.",
