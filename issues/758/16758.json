	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo1.6 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"darwin\"\r\nGOOS=\"darwin\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nI found Go regex is too slow. I compared the regex perf between java and Go:\r\nGo code:\r\n```\r\ntext := \"$value1$;$value2$;$value3$\"\r\n\tfor i := 0; i \u003c 1000000; i++ {\r\n\t\tmatch := pattern.FindAllStringSubmatch(text, -1)\r\n\t\tfor _, _ = range match {\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\nJava code:\r\n```\r\n        String value = \"$value1$;$value2$;$value3$\";\r\n        for (int i = 0; i \u003c 1000000; i++) {\r\n            Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(value);\r\n            while (matcher.find()) {\r\n                // do nothing\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nGo costs 2.702s and Java costs 472ms.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI think Go regex should not slower than Java so much.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nGo regex is much slower than Java.\r\n",
