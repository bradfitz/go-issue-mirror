So this problem can not arise with GNU ld or gold.  This is\nthe algorithm you suggest in comment #5.\n\nThe Debian bug report says the issue has been reported upstream, but I'm not sure\nwhether they mean it has been reported to the glibc maintainers or whether they mean\nthis bug report for Go.  I didn't see a glibc bug report in a quick look.\n\nI can never predict what Uli will do, but it is possible that he will push back on\nadding code to handle a case which can not occur with GNU ld.  Or he may simply accept\nthe patch if somebody sends it to him.\u003c/pre\u003e",
