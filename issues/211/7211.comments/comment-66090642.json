For an application with auto update functionality, it needs to\nknow to download the armv5, armv6 or amrv7 binary. I handle this manually by setting an\nextra variable at build time with -ldflags -X. But that requires *knowing* the correct\nvalue of GOARM, which is only available if the user sets it manually. Figuring it out\nwhen doing a native build on ARM is impossible as far as I can tell, since \"go env\"\ndoesn't print it. Grabbing the current architecture from uname is possible, but there's\nnothing to say Go isn't compiled with GOAMR=5 on a GOARM=6 box...\u003c/pre\u003e",
