	"body": "Thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to extend the idea to cover together benchmarks, tests and examples. If testing can't find anything to run, it outputs a warning message and changes the summary line to \"? package [no matches]\".\r\n\r\nThe illustrated cases in original proposal description remain the same. In cases where there are benchmarks to run, the warning or the ? will not appear.\r\n\r\n@mpvl thanks for volunteering but I already wrote a proof-of-concept and intend to make into a proper change. However, could I count on you to review it once done? :-)\r\n",
