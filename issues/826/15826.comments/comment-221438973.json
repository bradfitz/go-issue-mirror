Similarly as there is MapOf, ChanOf, PtrTo etc, maybe it is a good idea if there is Type method ... say BasedOn that returns the type the current one was based on and this could be used in asn1 to detect such cases.\n\nThanks,\n\nGeorge\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Ian Lance Taylor \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nSent: Tuesday, May 24, 2016 5:03 PM\nTo: golang/go\nCc: George; Author\nSubject: Re: [golang/go] The asn1 Marshal/Unmarshal get confused if I use a type instead the original type (#15826)\n\n\nIn Go a new type is a different type, it's not an alias for an existing type. There isn't any way that the encoding/asn1 package can detect that you are using a type based on ObjectIdentifier, rather than any other []int. If you need to marshal as an object identifier, you need to use ObjectIdentifier.\n\n-\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/15826#issuecomment-221437543\u003e\n",
