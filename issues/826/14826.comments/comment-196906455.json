I used Go 1.6 and configured my GOPATH the same way with two elements and tried repeatedly, sometimes deleting the $GOPATH pkg and src dirs.\r\n\r\nCan you clarify how you can reproduce this? Your repro steps say \"compile nomad 8f3bffe\" but that doesn't appear to match your stack trace. It appears that you actually are reporting a problem with \"go get\". I didn't take any care to fetch 8f3bffe specifically. Did you work around this somehow upstream?\r\n",
