It is too much to\ndetermine why this test is now failing.\n\nI think the redesign of the file type will allow much faster and better\ntesting of the various functions by allowing you to use a bytes.Buffer\ninstead of opening a file that may or may not have what you need to test in\nit.  The refactoring of parseProcNetIGMP into parseProcNetIGMP and\n_parseProcNetIGMP demonstrates how to make functions like this testable.\n\nThis CL is not intended to be submitted as is.  At a minimum the\n_oldParseProcNetIGMP function must be removed.  This is only provided to\ndemonstrate the parsing problem.  Also, the igmp_test.go test should only\nbe run on linux but I do not know the magic at the moment to make this\nhappen.  That can be addressed if we want to keep the test around.\n\nMany other functions in net should be refactored to allow solid testing.\u003c/pre\u003e",
