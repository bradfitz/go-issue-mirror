Counter-proposal: let's guarantee that this format will not change.\n\nSpecifically, I propose that the output format is exactly a sequence of lines containing space-separated fields:\n\n\t\u003cname\u003e \u003citerations\u003e (\u003cvalue\u003e \u003cunit\u003e)+\n\nThe number of \u003cvalue\u003e \u003cunit\u003e on a particular line is not specified, nor is the space of possible \u003cunit\u003es.\n\nThis describes all the current output and blesses (instead of forcing rewrites of) tools that parse the output already, like benchcmp and benchstat.\n\n/cc @aclements",
