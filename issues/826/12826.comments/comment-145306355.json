	"body": "Thanks for mentioning #2981.\r\n\r\nAssuming implementation would use `encoding/json` package without manual concatenation of json chunks, one advantage of `-format` over `-json` is that `go test` can stream results to stdout, rather than waiting for completion of all tests/benchmarks and then dump a big json blob. This is important for tools that present test results to the user. In my case, I need to process test output and print it out (annotated) **as soon as** a benchmark completes. Without streaming UX would be worse.\r\n\r\nEven if we concatenate json chunks, parsing them with `encoding/json` would not be convenient either.\r\n\r\nAlso from reading #2981 it seems that adding `-json` is hard, whereas adding `-format` is trivial, more consistent with `go list` and provides same, if not more, functionality.",
