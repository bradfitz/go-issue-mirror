What future changes to go test -bench might that cause friction with? I have a few things on my list. I'd like an external tool (e.g., benchstat) to be able to do linearity testing. We could support that by outputting lines for each run-up step. I'd like go test -bench to be able to output many more instances of shorter runs so external tools can compute more robust statistics. Again, go test -bench can just output more instances of the same benchmark line. I've thought about adding custom outputs (# of GCs, max pause, etc). We could support that by adding more (value unit) pairs.",
