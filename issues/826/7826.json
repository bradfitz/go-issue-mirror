Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat does 'go version' print?\n\ngo version go1.2.1 windows/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n1. Build the famous helloworld program on golang.org homepage.\n\npackage main\n\nimport \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfmt.Println(\u0026quot;Hello, 世界\u0026quot;)\n}\n\nAnd run go build. Suppose the executable is hello.exe.\n\n2. In cmd or Windows Powershell (code page set to cp936):\n  .\\hello.exe | more\n3. OR:\n  .\\hello.exe \u0026gt; a.txt\n  type a.txt\n\nWhat happened?\n\nIt prints:\n\nHello, 涓栫晫\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nIt should print:\n\nHello, 世界\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nOnly Non-Ascii characters are affected.\n\nThe output may vary with different code page settings.\n\nRedirected outputs in cmd and Powershell are different:\n\n.\\hello.exe \u0026gt; a.txt\n\nRun this in cmd, a.txt contains:\n\n0000000: 4865 6c6c 6f2c 20e4 b896 e795 8c0a       Hello, .......\n\nThis is a valid UTF-8 string. The content is correct if a.txt viewed in editors\nsupporting UTF-8 encoding.\n\nIn Powershell, a.txt contains:\n\n0000000: fffe 4800 6500 6c00 6c00 6f00 2c00 2000  ..H.e.l.l.o.,. .\n0000010: 936d 2b68 6b66 0d00 0a00                 .m+hkf....\n\nThis is the UTF-8 output, treated as cp936, and encoded into UTF-16.\n\nProblem also show up with godoc:\n\ngodoc math/cmplx Rect | more\n\nthen there's the problem displaying the symbol θ.\u003c/pre\u003e",
