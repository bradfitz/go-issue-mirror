Just want to state my personal point of view.\n\nHow is goinstall.exe is different (apart from having name that MS don't like) from any\nother? It is not \"requesting elevated rights\" from OS. It does what it is designed to\ndo. Questions, like \"Is it OK for this program to change your computer?\" are silly,\nbecause every program changes your computer, some program write to memory, others to\ndisk and so on.\n\nI don't know much about UAC to make a judgement, but what I've seen so far, tells me to\nstay away from it. I think it is attempting to solve hard problems by simple/silly\nsolutions.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
