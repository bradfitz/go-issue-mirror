This manifest file would have to be installed in the same location\nas goinstall.exe to function. Also, when testing, you must either recompile\ngoinstall.exe or update it's create date/time. Windows caches any .manifest file and if\nthe goinstall.exe timestamp has not changed since your last execution it does not bother\nlooking for a new .manifest file.\n\nI have also attached a .rc file when used with the resource file patch:\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/4516055/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/4516055/\u003c/a\u003e would embed the .manifest into the executable so\nonly 1 file has to be installed into Go/bin.\n\nThis solves the problem with this issue. It does not, however, solve other problems with\nGo install that you have run into as well. Should discussion/work on those issues\ncontinue here? BTW... after getting past the directory problem there are other problems\nas well.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1826/10/goinstall.exe.manifest\"\u003egoinstall.exe.manifest\u003c/a\u003e (402 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1826/10/goinstall.rc\"\u003egoinstall.rc\u003c/a\u003e (29 bytes)",
