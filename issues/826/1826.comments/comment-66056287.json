I continue to get:\n\nsh: ./goinstall.exe: Bad file number\n\nThe exit code is 126. This seems like an error with the operating system launching the\nprogram itself. I have tried to take all of the init() functions and var definitions\nthat may be causing this problem and put them into a test.go program, so far I cannot\nmake the test.go program fail as goinstall does.\n\nIs it possible to obtain a copy of your goinstall.exe to see if your identical\ngoinstall.exe fails on my machine? That may lead somewhere.\u003c/pre\u003e",
