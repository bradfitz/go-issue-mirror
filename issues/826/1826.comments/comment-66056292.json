User\nAccess Control (UAC) has something it calls Installer Detection Technology, please see:\n\u003ca href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd835540%28WS.10%29.aspx\"\u003ehttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd835540%28WS.10%29.aspx\u003c/a\u003e ... Scroll within\nthe page to the section titled \"Installer detection technology\"\n\nBasically Windows sees the word \"install\" in the executable and automatically determines\nthat the executable requires Admin privileges and thus tries to elevate the executable\npermission. I renamed the executable to goinst.exe and I now get the error that you are\ngetting... \n\ngoinst: github.com/droundy/goopt: mkdir C:\\Go\\src\\pkg\\github.com\\droundy\\: The s\nystem cannot find the path specified.\n\nI'll bet that you have UAC disabled and that is why you are not seeing the initial\nproblem I and others are reporting, but that's just a guess.\n\nI have not read entirely about the Installation detection technology but I believe it is\npossible to embed a resource stating this program does not require elevated privileges.\nI will do more research on this and report back. If so, the new patch on the mailing\nlist dealing with embedding resources via the linker could be used or possibly a\n.exe.manifest file could be created or the command name could be renamed (not a good\nthing because then there are platform differences in fundamental commands).\n\nI also have an idea about why we are now getting the above error. I will submit a patch\na little later today (wee hours in the morning here, need sleep before work starts :-)\u003c/pre\u003e",
