Telling someone to disable UAC\ncould be seen as telling someone to just use root all the time. In\nsome Linux distributions when you go to install a software package,\nfor example, it asks for the root password. That's the same thing UAC\ndoes. It can be silly at times, like we discovered in this case but it\nwas Microsoft's best attempt to make old (non-UAC aware apps) UAC\ncompliant, that's all. Probably solves the problem most of the time\nand then in situations like ours just causes problems... in the end,\nnaming the executable gomake solves all these problems, so it's a good\nsolution. No reason to argue, just offering a more detailed\nexplanation of UAC for everyones understanding.\u003c/pre\u003e",
