Calling runtime·setsig again does not change the fact that the code is\nexecuting inside a signal handler and the SIGABRT signal is blocked.  It would be\nreceived when the signal handler returns and signals are unblocked, but of course the\ncode instead simply exits before that happens.\u003c/pre\u003e",
