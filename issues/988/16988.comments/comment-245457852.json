I don't know.\r\n\r\n\u003e Would adding them all slow things down in errnoErr?\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't. Let that be the compiler's problem. Switching on ints is on the TODO list to optimize more anyway.\r\n\r\nPlus: it's an error path. How fast does it have to be?\r\n\r\n\u003e How would I do that? Write some code in runtime to dump all encountered in errnoErr errors into a global file? Then sort and uniq?\r\n\r\nSounds good.\r\n\r\n",
