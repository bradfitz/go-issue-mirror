Yes, the conversion of error code e1 to error should not be repeated.\r\nMSDN page of WSARecv ( https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms740668(v=vs.85).aspx#WSAEINPROGRESS ) said:\r\n\r\n\"A blocking operation is currently executing. Windows Sockets only allows a single blocking operation—per- task or thread—to be outstanding, and if any other function call is made (whether or not it references that or any other socket) the function fails with the WSAEINPROGRESS error.\"\r\n\r\nThis might be the cause.",
