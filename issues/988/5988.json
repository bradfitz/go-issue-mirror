This\nmeans that unless your RuneReader supports seeking, you will lose some of your input.\nbufio is the most common RuneReader and it does not support seeking.\n\nWe can defer reading the lookahead rune until after we've checked for a match. That gets\ngives us one of the Runes. However, we must read one past the final match because that\nrune might also match. We could consider using RuneScanner and putting the rune back\nafter the final match.\n\nNot sure if it's possible to have the property of just reading the match in all cases. I\nthink it might break when the last op is an alternation or a conditional. Still, I think\nit's worth doing.\u003c/pre\u003e",
