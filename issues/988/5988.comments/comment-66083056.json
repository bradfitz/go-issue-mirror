If you are matching /x(.*y)?/ you have to read the\nentire input just in case there is a y that would extend the match. This is fundamental\nto regexp search.\n\nPerhaps it is true that they read 2 runes beyond the match no matter what; I don't know.\nIf so, that strikes me as a good thing, because then people will be less surprised by\nlonger \"readahead\".\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
