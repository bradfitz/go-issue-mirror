It would be useful if\nyou could be a bit more specific: For instance, would it be sufficient to have Popcount\nas a method on a big.Int? We already have core routines in assembly for math/big, and\nthis would be a natural fit. Or is Popcount mostly used for short (one, two-word) data?\n(the big.Int Popcount would be overkill).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @griesemer._\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
