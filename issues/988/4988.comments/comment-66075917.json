Still, on a\n2.8Ghz Quad-Core Intel Xeon machine with 800MHz DDR2 RAM, I get approx. 10ns for a\nsingle 64bit pop-count computation.\n\n10ns seems pretty good, and unless your application is doing nothing but popcount, even\nmaking it 10x faster might not make a big difference overall.\n\nThus, doing this in software might be just fine for almost all purposes. It's trivial\nenough that a library may not be warranted - and a custom solution is likely to be\nfaster because it can use the right type (sizes).\u003c/pre\u003e",
