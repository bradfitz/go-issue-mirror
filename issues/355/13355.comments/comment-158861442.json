Any action invoked by the user inside the editor is expected to make its modifications to editor buffers via the editors own text buffer APIs so that those edits are tracked on the undo stack. Pretty sure all of that is standard across tools.\r\n\r\nSo to have undo support, we would need forename to provide the set of edits and the editor plugin to actually apply these using the editors APIs.
