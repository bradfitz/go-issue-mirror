But I never had any problems with Go source files having LF instead of CR/LF.\r\n\r\nAll standard Go repositories use .gitattributes file (see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9281#issuecomment-66839988 for details) to make git treat all source files as binaries. This helps with \"LF instead of CR/LF\" problem. Is that correct approach? Is it suitable for others? I am not sure. But works fine for Go Team.\r\n\r\nI suppose we need to understand what the real problem here is. Then we can decide what the solution is.\r\n\r\nAlex",
