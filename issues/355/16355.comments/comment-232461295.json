They aren't the same issue, at all.  Some Windows tools don't properly handle LF terminated files.  None care about tabs or spaces.\r\ngofmt should not be the hammer used to drive home a personal 'one true EOL' battle.\r\nWould I like everything to use the same line endings?  Sure, but that's not the reality.\r\nThis is fundamentally a Windows platform support issue, and one where Go is not being a good citizen.",
