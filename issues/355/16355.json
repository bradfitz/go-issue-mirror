	"body": "This is present in all current versions of gofmt.\r\nIssue #2242 referenced it, but I was asked to create a new issue for it by Robert.\r\nRobert, we spoke about this at Gophercon to help jog your memory.\r\n\r\nBasically, with a \\r\\n terminated .go file, gofmt will rewrite the entire file to be \\n terminated instead.  Windows systems use this by default (so this isn't the place for a one-true EOL discussion please) and gofmt should honor the format of the source file.  Changing the line endings has a huge impact in regards to source control systems let alone some native windows tools not handling it well.\r\n\r\nTo keep it simple, I would suggest just using the line terminator from the first line as the hint for the entire file.  Determine the EOL chars from the first line - apply on all future writes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
