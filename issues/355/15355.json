	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n1.6.1\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\nset GOARCH=amd64\r\nset GOHOSTARCH=amd64\r\nset GOHOSTOS=windows\r\nset GOOS=windows\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nRunning a `go test -v ${PACKAGES}` with a proprietary repository.  Invoked via a powershell script, like this:\r\n```powershell\r\n$GOPKG = (go list ./... ) | Out-String -stream | select-string -NotMatch vendor\r\niex \"go test -v $GOPKG\"\r\n```\r\nCurrently this is about 60 package names passed into go test.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nTests to build \u0026 pass üëç \r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nAs best as we can see, about 5% of the time in a CI build, we get this build error during the test run:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo build testmain: C:\\Go\\pkg\\tool\\windows_amd64\\link.exe: chdir .: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.\r\n```\r\n",
