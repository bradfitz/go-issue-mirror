It has always been a linear scan through field names, so it has never been as fast as it could be.\r\n\r\nWe could either build a map in the reflect package to make FieldByName fast, or better we could modify the template package so that, like encoders and decoders, on first encounter with a type it builds a contraption for reading type data. That way FieldByName is only called once per type instead of once per template execution.",
