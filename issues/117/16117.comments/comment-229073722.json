	"body": "Sameer pointed this bug out to me. Regressions on microbenchmarks may be very misleading since they are just busy loops around tiny amounts of code. More interesting would be to run the x/bench subrepo benchmarks on these systems and see if there is anything significant there. If not, waiting for SSA on these other systems seems like a decent plan. I haven't looked at any of the CLs, but please remember to make very small, very high confidence changes. Thanks.",
