	"body": "It seems that if you have many goroutines that do lookups, they are tied to one routine that does the actual DNS resolve. If it succeeds, the answer is provided to everyone and all is happy.\r\n\r\nWhen it times out, rather than releasing everyone, all the goroutines must also wait their time out too. It would make more sense to also release the other routines with the errTimeout immediately.",
