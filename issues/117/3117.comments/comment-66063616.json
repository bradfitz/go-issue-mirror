If m doesn't contain an entry with key \"foo\", tmp will\nbe the zero value for the map value type and this code still works (by setting the\nrespective entry for the first time).\n\nNote that if direct assignment as in\n\nm[\"foo\"].x = 4\n\nwere permitted, one of the issues (in the language t.b.d.) would be what to do if\nm[\"foo\"] doesn't exist (non-trivial).\u003c/pre\u003e",
