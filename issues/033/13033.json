	"body": "I am building an iOS library for a swift project. I recently noticed, if I export a pointer type like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype PubStruct {\r\n  MyThing *Thing\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get an objective c class created with getter/setters, setMyThing and myThing. However, if MyThing is nil, and I call the getter from the swift side. It doesn't get a nil pointer on the swift side, it gets, what I assume is the proxy object, a reference, so then when I try to call a method on MyThing it crashes on the go side.\r\n\r\nNot a great explanation, but I can produce an example if necessary. But in general, does gomobile for iOS support nil pointer fields?",
