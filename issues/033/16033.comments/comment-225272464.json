The current identifier rules forbid combining characters; perhaps that should be relaxed, although that will require a canonicalization rule for combining characters.\r\n\r\nI started work (and then abandoned) a draft RFC for a [PRECIS](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/text/secure/precis) profile for programing language identifiers a while back. Specifically this used the NFC canonicalization rule for combining characters and a width mapping rule to ensure that full-width and half-width characters were mapped to their decomposition mappings (on some machines a keystroke may output a full-width character while on another machine the same keystroke outputs the half-width version; this presumably would be very confusing for users in locales that use full-width characters heavily such as many East Asian languages).\r\n\r\nI'd love to see a PRECIS profile used for all Go identifiers in the future, and would be happy to pick back up the RFC work and help the community standardize on a set of rules.",
