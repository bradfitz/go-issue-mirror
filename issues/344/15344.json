	"body": "Every time you run \"git codereview mail\" it creates a new tag (as per [its doc](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/review/git-codereview)). \r\n\r\nI've never actually used these tags for their advertised purpose (if I did need to diff against my last mailed commit, I would just use the advertised commit hash from within gerrit), so I don't benefit from them. \r\n\r\nOTOH, they do interrupt my workflow. For example, the [common git bash completion script](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash) prints all pending tags when auto-completing `git commit \u003cTAB\u003e`, and the sheer number of mailed tags obfuscates any useful information.\r\n\r\nSo, this is a feature request to disable their automatic creation.",
