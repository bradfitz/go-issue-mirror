Since this behaviour clearly fails with system-wide Go installs (some people do use apt-get install golang), the -a command-line option stopped affecting the Go's own files in 1.4.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not true. I'm use go from package system (that install it in\r\nsystem-wide /usr/lib/go) and -a works fine under user rebuild all\r\ninside /tmp and doing static linking after all deps recompiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nVasiliy Tolstov,\r\ne-mail: v.tolstov@selfip.ru\r\njabber: vase@selfip.ru",
