	"body": "@vtolstov the behaviour of go install -a was changed in 1.4 so it doesn't recompile the std library if you are using a release version of Go. \r\n\r\nThis issue looks like an unfortunate side effect of that change. There seems to be no way to recompile the standard library in a release version of Go without recompiling all of Go from source. While that's not onerous for those who regularly use the source version it will cause problems for those who want or need to use pre-packaged versions.\r\n\r\nThis discussion from golang-dev is relevant: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/2ZUi792oztM/Q0rg_DkF5HMJ\r\n\r\nOne solution might be to skip building the std library except when the -tags argument is used and any of the specified tags are used by the std library.",
