	"body": "@glyn, if I understood correctly (@minux did not address my question directly), before 1.3, when you performed the encantation being discussed, a part of the Go's stdlib has been silently rebuilt and replaced -- most of folks did not notice it because most have Go built from the source and installed somewhere under ~. Since this behaviour clearly fails with system-wide Go installs (some people do use `apt-get install golang`), the `-a` command-line option stopped affecting the Go's own files in 1.4.\r\n\r\nThe solution is just to build and install another instalce of the Go toolchain and use it via custom $GOROOT where applicable.\r\n\r\nIOW, building fully static programs on Linux did not ever do The Right Thing. I think it might be sensible to file a wishlist bug asking to somehow make stdlib support both behaviours out of the box. Dunno if it's feasible to implement.",
