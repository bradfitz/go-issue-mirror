	"body": "The future GCC 6 is making heavier use of DW_AT_specification, which cgo does not understand.  This was reported against gccgo as https://gcc.gnu.org/PR68072, but it is a general Go problem.  Filing this here to consider adding the patch (which I will send out momentarily) to Go 1.5.2.\r\n\r\nThe bug can occur in various ways, but the simplest is when there is both an external declaration for a variable and a real declaration, as in\r\n\r\n    // extern int i;\r\n    // int i;\r\n    import \"C\"\r\n\r\nOf course in practice the `extern int i;` would be in a header file.  GCC 6 now generates a DW_AT_specification pointing from one declaration to the other.  (This is part of the early debug work described at https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/early-debug .)  The cgo tool sees a variable entry that uses DW_AT_specification, an entry that has no name or type, and issues a \"malformed DWARF TagVariable entry\" error.",
