It is trying to execute PREFETCHNTA which is\nan SSE instruction that the Geode processor doesn't support.\n\nI was able to fix this with an ugly hack.  I just commented out the body of the\ngprefetch function in 8c/txt.c to prevent 8c from generating that instruction.  Since\nthe prefetch instruction is just there to speed things up and shouldn't change the\ncorrectness of the executable, this should work and it does.\u003c/pre\u003e",
