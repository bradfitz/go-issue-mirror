The build\nprocess builds the compilers, then the a small version of the go tool, go_bootstrap is\nbuilt by hand, which is then used to produce the full go tool.\n\nTo date, we don't have an openbsd/386 builder, so I'm not surprised that it ran into\nproblems. When goarch says 386, it means 'not amd64' not 80386, the minimum requirements\nfor 32bit intel architecture is a Pentium with MMX.\n\n+cc jsing\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-openbsd**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
