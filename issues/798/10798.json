	"body": "hi, here's my test program:\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/r1Wz8mdWKO\r\n\r\nactually I was testing performance between sync.Mutex and channel.\r\nbut I acciddently found that if I set GOMAXPROCS to 2(or more), the program has totally differently behavior on different machines:\r\n\r\nif I set GOMAXPROCS to 2 instead of 1:\r\non my pc with win7x64 e3-2130v3 16gddr3: uselock() runs 5 times slower while channel() basically no change.\r\n\r\non my friends laptop with win7x86 t7300 2gddr2ram: both functions run basically no change on speed.\r\n\r\non a linux x64 vps with 2x e5-2650: channel() runs about 100% slower, uselock() runs 3 times slower.\r\n\r\non a bananapi running linux, both functions runs about 25% faster.\r\n\r\nall binaries are build by go 1.4.2 on my windows pc.\r\n\r\nso why am i getting such behavior?",
