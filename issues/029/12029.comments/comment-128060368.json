	"body": "Hi. Windows ports of gcc vary wildly. As documented on https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/InstallFromSource#install-c-tools, building Go from source requires TDM-GCC. My understanding is that MSYS2 is the same kind of thing as Cygwin. I'm glad that works for Bazel, but Go expects to use the raw Windows libraries, not a POSIX wrapper. I don't believe we are going to support Go using POSIX wrapper utilities. Doing both is too hard, and the POSIX wrappers always eventually get in the way.",
