So the append should be a noop (note the \"...\" in the append\nline).\n\nMy best guess for triggering a problem was this structure:\n\nleaf -\u003e issuer2 -\u003e issuer2Parent\n     -\u003e issuer1 -\u003e root*\n\nBoth issuer1 and issuer2 are possible issuers for leaf. issuer2 is listed first and the\nchain builds up to another parent, but no root. issuer1 is then considered and does\nchain to a trusted root. (Where a trusted certificate is indicated by a *.)\n\nHowever, this works as expected.\u003c/pre\u003e",
