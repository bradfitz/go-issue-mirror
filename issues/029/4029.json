	"body": "by **d.wright.dev**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nThis is an issue that implies that there might be something funny going on with 8l\n(illegal code points? newlines? non printing characters?), although the exported symbols\nare printed by nm.\n\nWhen exporting function symbols using the //export \u0026lt;symbolname\u0026gt; comment syntax on\nMountain Lion, they cannot reliably be found by dlsym() when invoked upon the executable\nfrom within the program itself. \n\nThe behavior seems to vary by symbol name. If the first character of the export is\nseveral letters off in alphabetical sequence from the last one, dlsym() finds the\nsymbol. This is pretty inconvenient and obviously not the main issue.\n\nsee: dlbug_fail.go, dlbug_pass.go\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n\u0026gt; go run dlbug_fail.go\n\nsymbol:IMPWindowResize found\nsymbol:IMPDrawRect found\nsymbol:IMPInitWithFrame found\nsymbol:IMPIsOpaque found\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nsymbol:IMPWindowResize found\nsymbol:IMPDrawRect error: dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, IMPDrawRect): symbol not found\nsymbol:IMPInitWithFrame found\nsymbol:IMPIsOpaque error: dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, IMPIsOpaque): symbol not found\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nOS X 10.8.1 (12B19)\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo version go1.0.2\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nIf I could make a suggestion about resource allocation: not being able to use cgo from\nwithin gotest prevents integration of regression testing on this sort of issue. It's\nprobably worth the time to fix that. The first thing I tried to do before submitting a\nreport was to package these files as tests. \n\nAlso, \u0026quot;go run\u0026quot; treats files named *_test.go as tests and then fails if tests\naren't found.\n\nI'll file these suggestions as separate bugs.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4029/0/dlbug_fail.go\"\u003edlbug_fail.go\u003c/a\u003e (1371 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4029/0/dlbug_pass.go\"\u003edlbug_pass.go\u003c/a\u003e (1371 bytes)",
