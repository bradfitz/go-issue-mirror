They are called like any other function but some of\nthem accept a type instead of an expression as the first argument.\n\nThe built-in functions do not have standard Go types, so they can only appear in call\nexpressions; they cannot be used as function values.\"\n\nSince \"They are called like any other function\" one would expect this to work. My\nintention was to fix it for go/types. That said, it's never been an issue in real code\nand pretty unimportant. We do have the choice to add another exception to the 2nd\nsentence to document the status quo. I'd find that somewhat unfortunate but I don't feel\nstrongly about it at the moment.\u003c/pre\u003e",
