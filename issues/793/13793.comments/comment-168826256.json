It says that values outside the Unicode code point range are converted to 0xfffd which is what should happen here.\r\n\r\nI believe cmd/compile is incorrect; it should accept this code w/o error. FWIW, gotype also accepts this code (and - like gccgo - has code to handle this case specifically).\r\n\r\nIt should be ok to fix cmd/compile as it will not restrict the set of accepted programs (and thus is not an error that we must keep for backward-compatibility).",
