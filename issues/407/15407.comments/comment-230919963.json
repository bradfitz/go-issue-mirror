In there we find:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  174:d=2  hl=2 l=  30 cons:   SEQUENCE          \r\n  176:d=3  hl=2 l=  13 prim:    UTCTIME           :150814074318Z\r\n  191:d=3  hl=2 l=  13 prim:    GENERALIZEDTIME   :203008210000Z\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, [the spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.5.2) says:\r\n\r\n\u003e GeneralizedTime values MUST be expressed in Greenwich Mean Time (Zulu) and MUST include seconds (i.e., times are YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ)\r\n\r\nAnd that GENERALIZEDTIME does not include seconds.\r\n\r\nHowever, all is not lost. Firstly, the TLS server should not be sending the root certificate in the first place so step one is to fix that. Then, when verifying the chain, you can use an altered root certificate with the seconds included. (I'll email you a fixed version of your root because playing with ASN.1 can be a pain.) The self-signature on the altered certificate will be invalid, of course, but the self-signature in a root certificate is just a placeholder anyway.",
