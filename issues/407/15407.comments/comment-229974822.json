	"body": "Well sorry being late here - didn't manage it to answer earlier - the cert is a default as in no special settings - openssl created one - so I would expect to have valid timestamps. I've seen the timestamp discussion already but wondered if there are some settings to care of within openssl cnf files and commands to avoid this issue in golang?\r\n\r\nas the cert in quest das work properly with other applications and code based on different languages than golang.\r\n\r\nas the cert is an internal one - and might contain sensitive data - are there options to send it out of band e.g. not as a github issue comment?\r\n",
