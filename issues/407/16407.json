What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\namd64, linux\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\ngo get github.com/zhenjl/xparse/etld \r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nA response in reasonable time.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nNo response - the code takes a very long time to compile.\r\n\r\nUnder Go 1.4, the package takes ~2s to install. Under Go 1.6, it took ~4s.\r\n\r\nUsing Go1.7rc1 I killed the compiler after 9 minutes because my machine was\r\noverheating and becoming unusable.\r\n\r\nIt's a large state machine, but this doesn't seem like reasonable compiler behaviour.\r\nFWIW this package is used as part of the `sequencer` tool (see http://zhen.org/blog/sequence-high-performance-sequential-semantic-log--parser/)\r\n\r\n",
