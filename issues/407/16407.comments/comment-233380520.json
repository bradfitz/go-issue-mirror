But I will say that I would consider converting some of the innermost switch statements to lookup tables. This should compile faster, run faster, and probably produce a smaller binary, particularly if you shift all array indices so that the smallest interesting value is 0. This might require a non-trivial transform, though, to indicate e.g. (lines 495-594) a new value for s and a new value for m and whether to check i and pb before modifying m.",
