	"body": "If a `sync.Mutex` has decided that it has been misused enough to issue a runtime panic, all bets are off at that point and the mutex should no longer be used. (I think the same is true for `sync.WaitGroup` if the counter goes negative.) Maybe a documentation change to specify that such values should not be reused after panic would be good.\r\n\r\nI think you would need to implement your own mutex if you want a trylock.",
