	"body": "by **armon.dadgar**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThis issue has cropped up from a bug report against Serf here:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/serf/issues/123\"\u003ehttps://github.com/hashicorp/serf/issues/123\u003c/a\u003e\n\nSerf seems to have no issues on other platforms, however on this Linux ARM\nenvironment, it seems that UDP packets cannot be sent or received.\n\nWe ran it under strace, and collected a the relevant sample, available here:\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bvfv4zjtmnqr12o/serf.stderr.output\"\u003ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bvfv4zjtmnqr12o/serf.stderr.output\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIt seems that `recvfrom` is always failing with EFAULT preventing packets from\nbeing received. Similarly `sendto` is failing with EINVAL preventing packets\nfrom being sent.\n\nUser is reporting the master build of Serf on ARM can reproduce the problem.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Run a Serf agent on ARM \u0026quot;serf agent\u0026quot;\n2. Run another Serf agent\n3. Join the agents \u0026quot;serf join \u0026lt;agent1\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\n4. Error messages about failed packet send/receive will appear\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nNo error messages\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n2014/02/08 13:24:36 [ERR] memberlist: Failed to send gossip to 192.168.2.1:7946: write\nudp: invalid argument\n2014/02/08 13:24:36 [ERR] memberlist: Error reading UDP packet: read udp\n192.168.2.2:7946: bad address\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux version 2.6.12.6-arm1 (root@NasARM4) (gcc version 3.4.4 (release) (CodeSourcery\nARM 2005q3-2)) #2 Sun Sep 18 02:09:29 CST 2011 \n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.2 darwin/amd64\u003c/pre\u003e",
