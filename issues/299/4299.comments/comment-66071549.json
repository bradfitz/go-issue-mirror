We could also likely reduce the cost of RSA blinding by\nsquaring the same manner as OpenSSL rather than generating a new blind each time.\n\nLastly, a high-speed, constant time P-256 would also help.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **LongTerm**._",
