DES (in the second trace)\nis well known to be a terrible CPU hog. AES (the first trace) isn't quite so bad.\nUnfortunately your machine doesn't appear to have AES-NI support in the CPU so the AES\ncode is pure Go and somewhat slow. I'd be happy to have optimised versions for various\nother CPUs but I'm afraid that we don't, yet.\u003c/pre\u003e",
