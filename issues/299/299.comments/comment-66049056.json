Ed has been part of basic \"/bin\" package of \nevery major Linux distribution since... like forever. Its presence on *nix like \nsystem can be relied on upon the same way as on existence of basic file handling \ncommands like \"cp\", \"rm\", \"chown\" or \"cat\" for that matter. I'm not sure but it may \neven be contained in POSIX standard. It's YOU who is exceptional here not Golang \nteam. Ed is not obsolete. Is usage of sed by configure scripts obsolete because \n\"nowadays\" simple regex substitution, and more, can be done with Perl? How \nunreasonable would it be to demand much larger in terms of disk space dependence on \nPerl when the job can be done with a single 70kB binary?\u003c/pre\u003e",
