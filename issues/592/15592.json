	"title": "x/net/http2: toggle HPACK dynamic table indexing for header",
	"body": "Often a service will have certain header fields that have no discernible repeatable pattern (or the possible combinations far outnumber the HPACK table slots). It would be good to be able to turn off HPACK for those headers so that these non-repeating values don't use up slots in the dynamic table.\r\n\r\nHere's a quote from [Apple's APNs documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/APNsProviderAPI.html) touching on this:\r\n\r\n\u003e APNs requires the use of HPACK (header compression for HTTP/2), which prevents repeated header keys and values. APNs maintains a small dynamic table for HPACK. To help avoid filling up the APNs HPACK table and necessitating the discarding of table data, encode headers in the following wayâ€”especially when sending a large number of streams:\r\n\u003e * The `:path` header should be encoded as a literal header field without indexing,\r\n\u003e * The `apns-id` and `apns-expiration` headers should be encoded differently depending on initial or subsequent POST operation, as follows:\r\n\u003e   * The first time you send these headers, encode them with incremental indexing to allow the header names to be added to the dynamic table\r\n\u003e   * Subsequent times you send these headers, encode them as literal header fields without indexing",
