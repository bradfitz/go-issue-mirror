Since buckets are\nnever reused, a bucket allocated for 2048-byte objects should always have a\ncount that is a multiple of 2048. Even if 64-bit operations were\ninterrupted, this property should still hold (and the recent_xxx numbers\nare uint32s anyway; the int64 doesn't come into play until they are\nretrieved as a heap profile).\n\nSomething is still wrong, either in the code or in our understanding of the\nbug.\u003c/pre\u003e",
