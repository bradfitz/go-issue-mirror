Since `onCreate` is only called within `android.go` when utilizing a `NativeActivity`, the `assetManager` variable is not set.\r\n\r\nI'm going to create a patch for my needs, but I'm not sure if this is something that is expected to be supported in general (calling `app.Open(.)` if you are not using a fully-native activity). Any thoughts?",
