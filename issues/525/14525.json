What did you do?\r\n(Use play.golang.org to provide a runnable example, if possible.)\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/Ibi4KpmgiE\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n[[2 The Godfather 1972]]\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n[[2 The Godfather|1972]]\r\n - notice the | character that means, it is not split\r\n\r\n**Extra notes:**\r\nIn the play.golang.org example, if you move the double quote after the letter T\r\nthen it works just fine\r\nhowever it seems like if the double quote is right after the delimiter, the outcome is not as expected",
