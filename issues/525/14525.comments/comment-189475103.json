	"body": "\u003e The documentation just seems confusing to me then, because I can put the \" anywhere else with LazyQuotes on\r\n\u003e but the only time it goes 'wrong' (no error) is when I put the \" as first character on the right of the delimiter (or start of line)\r\n\r\nThis is consistent with the documentation as I read it.  Any fields that starts with a \" is a quoted field.  The `LazyQuotes` configuration only affects unquoted fields.  `LazyQuotes` doesn't mean that quotes are ignored.\r\n\r\nIn the past we've rejected requests to add further configuration parameters to encoding/csv, because there are just too many variants.  We can't support them all and still have a comprehensible package--you can see how even the `LazyQuotes` configuration parameter is confusing.  I would suggest that you copy the package and adjust it for your needs.\r\n\r\nActually, if you really don't care about quotes at all, then it seems to me that encoding/csv becomes almost trivial.  You may as well just read line by line and call strings.Split(line, \",\").",
