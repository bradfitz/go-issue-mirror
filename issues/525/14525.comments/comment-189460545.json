	"body": "Thank you,\r\n\r\nThe documentation just seems confusing to me then, because I can put the \" anywhere else with LazyQuotes on\r\nbut the only time it goes 'wrong' (no error) is when I put the \" as first character on the right of the delimiter (or start of line)\r\n\r\nIf this is not a bug, how can I request a feature, that would add a config option to totally disable the \"quoted field\" ability?\r\nthe reason is, I want to use the csv package to check data not generated by myself, which could contain any character, however the only consistent item is the delimiter. therefor a \" can exist anywhere in the data.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help",
