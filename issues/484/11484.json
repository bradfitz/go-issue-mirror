	"title": "runtime: remove mSpanInUse count loop from STW",
	"body": "On multi-gigabyte heaps, about half of our mark termination time (~5ms of ~10ms at 4GB) is spent in the loop in gcSweep that counts how many spans are mSpanInUse. We should fix this for 1.6. One possible solution is simply to keep track of the number of spans in this state. We could also probably move the loop out of STW, but it seems easier to just keep the count.\r\n\r\n@RLH",
