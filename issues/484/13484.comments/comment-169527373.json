I am less convinced about the other signals.\n\nOn OS X it's important not to do this for any signal that might cause a core dump, because due to brain damage in OS X, the core dump will include lots of uninitialized but mapped memory and take up 100s of GBs. Every time I accidentally cause a Go program to dump core on OS X without \"ulimit -c 0\" set, the core dump fills my 500 GB laptop disk.\n\nPerhaps we should leave this for Go 1.7, although the systemd use case suggests that maybe we should do SIGTERM/SIGQUIT/maybe SIGINT for Go 1.6.\n\n@ianlancetaylor, what do you think? You may have all the mechanism in place now.",
