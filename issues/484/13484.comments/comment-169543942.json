We now exit with the signal status for SIGHUP, SIGINT, and SIGTERM; these are the signals for which the SigKill flag is set, the same set of signals for which we previously did a silent exit(2).\r\n\r\nWe don't do it for SIGQUIT, since raising SIGQUIT would cause a core dump; we only want a core dump if GOTRACEBACK=crash.",
