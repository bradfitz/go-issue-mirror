If you put it in the driverConn, how do you find out which connection to use?\r\n\r\nI said about changing `driverConn.openStmt` from `map[driver.Stmt]bool` to `map[*Stmt]driver.Stmt`.\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/database/sql/sql.go#L244\r\n\r\nBut I couldn't remove `Stmt.css` simply because `Stmt.finalClose()` uses it.\r\nI'll try changing `Stmt.css` from `[]connStmt` to `map[*driverConn]driver.Stmt`.",
