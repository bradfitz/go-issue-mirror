	"body": "An idea for cleaning up: store an atomic counter in *DB, and increment it in driverConn.Close().  When creating a Stmt, store the current value of the counter inside the Stmt.  In Stmt.connStmt(), compare the current value of the counter to the stored value.  If the difference is bigger than N, iterate over css and clean up dead connections and store the new value of the counter in Stmt.\r\n\r\nThis way if no connections have recently died, we only need to do one atomic fetch + a comparison in connStmt().  Additionally, only one execution has to pay the price of cleaning up since the next one will see the counter having increased.",
