	"body": "Since the main use for freevars is to pull subsequences into new functions, it seems weird that bound variables within a block doesn't get marked as free when used in a return.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc blah() int {\r\n\tif true {\r\n\t\tvar i int\r\n\t\ti = 20\r\n\t\treturn i\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf you get the freevars within the `if true {` block, the `i` variable will not show as free.\r\n\r\nSince a return behaves as an assignment to the return variable and then exit, I think it's reasonable to consider it as a free variable, even though it doesn't follow the definition exactly.",
