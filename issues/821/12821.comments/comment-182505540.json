	"body": "Hi Daniel.  You are right that the return acts like an assignment, but it is an assignment not to `i` but to the result variable, which is unnamed in your example.  The variable `i` is definitely not free in this block.  Had the result variable been named, as in this example\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc blah() (result int) {\r\n    if true {\r\n        var i int\r\n        i = 20\r\n        return i // implicitly: result = i\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nit would also not be free, because there are no explicit uses of the name `result` within the block, although of course there is an implicit use.\r\n\r\nThere is quite a bit more to the \"extract function\" refactoring than what the oracle `freevars` query does.",
