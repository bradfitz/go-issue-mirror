Briefly, off the top of my head:\r\n\r\nRSA, DSA, DH: none are constant time because math/big isn't.\r\nP-224 and P-256: the interface involves math/big but, apart from the import/export, should be CT.\r\nP-521: not CT as it uses big/math.\r\nAES: generic code uses T-tables, so not CT. amd64 with AESNI is safe though.\r\nGHASH: has tables too, so no. amd64 with AESNI is safe though.\r\n",
