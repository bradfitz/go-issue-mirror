Do you feel more CT code would be desirable?\r\n\r\nI failed to see any note about CT/non-CT behavior in ECDSA, having turned to https://godoc.org for crypto, crypto/elliptic, crypto/ecdsa and finally the generic (non-P-224/P-256) sources.\r\n\r\nI hadn't looked at godoc for crypto/rsa, where I now realize that at least the attribute \"constant time\" is used indeed and hence, by contrast, might have allowed the inference that other aspects not marked like that are not necessarily CT.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of a user: Would it be too much to ask for a warning in the docs, rather than something to be inferred from a seemingly irrelevant sublibrary? Where should I have looked, BTW?",
