	"body": "In a lot of cases polling a pin for its state is sub optimum, being able to rely on interrupts is kind a convenient way to reduce the latency of change detection and avoid potential bugs. While this is not needed everywhere, I think it would be great to have that in the x/exp/io package.\r\n\r\nThis approach was implemented in the embd package using the following interface:\r\nhttps://github.com/kidoman/embd/blob/master/gpio.go#L37\r\n\r\nAnd implementing it on linux using epoll:\r\nhttps://github.com/kidoman/embd/blob/master/host/generic/interrupt.go\r\n\r\n@rakyll how do you feel about supporting such an approach?",
