	"body": "4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n    Constant-time arithmetic (and no data-dependent slice or array indexing) for *all* cryptographic operations to foil timing side-channel attacks. EDIT: Implementation of constant-time primitives in a similarly caution-inspiringly named package as crypto/subtle.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n    Use of non-constant time multiplications in https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/math/big/nat.go (used via math/big for example by crypto/elliptic and crypto/rsa). EDIT: Primitives for constant-time comparisons only (but not for other bignum operations) in crypto/subtle.\r\n\r\nThis is a security issue that should either be documented (if the authors feel it can be ignored, to explain why and how) or addressed by changing the code appropriately.",
