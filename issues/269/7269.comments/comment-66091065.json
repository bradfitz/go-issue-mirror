When an interface value is nil (not just\nholds a nil value of some type, but actually nil) then there is no method.\n\nAlan: I understand that point but it doesn't seem precisely correct to me.  If taken\nliterally it would mean that\n    var err error\n    f := err.Error\n    if f == nil { println(\"nil\") } else { println(\"not nil\") }\nwould print \"not nil\".  That seems strange.  If a method value of a nil interface\ndoesn't panic, it seems to me that it must return nil.\u003c/pre\u003e",
