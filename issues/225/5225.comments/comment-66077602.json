They look unrelated.\n\nThat is, file 2 bugs:\n\n\"net: test failure: can't find 224.0.0.254 in multicast RIB\"\n\n\"runtime/cgo: test failures with linker\"\n\n--- FAIL: TestCgoCrashHandler (1.31 seconds)\n\tcrash_test.go:62: expected \"main: recovered done\\nnew-thread: recovered done\\nsecond-new-thread: recovered done\\nmain-again: recovered done\\n\", but got \"# command-line-arguments\\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.6.3/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /var/tmp/go-link-mgzutN/go.o: relocation R_X86_64_32 against `main.func·001·f' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC\\n/var/tmp/go-link-mgzutN/go.o: could not read symbols: Bad value\\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\\nfmt.statictmp_0731: /home/minibill/src/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/6l: running gcc failed: unsuccessful exit status 0x100\\n\"\n--- FAIL: TestCgoSignalDeadlock (1.32 seconds)\n\tcrash_cgo_test.go:21: expected \"OK\\n\", but got \"# command-line-arguments\\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.6.3/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /var/tmp/go-link-SY187e/go.o: relocation R_X86_64_32 against `type.*' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC\\n/var/tmp/go-link-SY187e/go.o: could not read symbols: Bad value\\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\\nfmt.statictmp_0731: /home/minibill/src/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/6l: running gcc failed: unsuccessful exit status 0x100\\n\"\nFAIL\n\n\n\nAnd maybe file a third bug, unless the weird /etc permission is something you've done to\nyour system:\n\n\n\"os: test failure: can't readdir /etc on gentoo\"\n\n... or something.\n\nInclude details of system, architecture, version, etc.\n\nJust paste the failure snippets in the bugs.  You can still attach the full log if you'd\nlike, but don't rely on just the attachment for your bug report.\u003c/pre\u003e",
