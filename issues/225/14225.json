	"body": "https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html needs to have the \"R=go1.7\" convention described, including that no further review or uploads take place due to the noise created.\r\n\r\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/19178/ had a R=go1.7 added.  I thought that meant it didn't stand a chance of being approved until 1.7 was open for business.  I reviewed it.  The author uploaded a new patchset.  Then @bradfitz repeated the R=go1.7 with \"Please hold on updates or reviews until Go 1.6 is out\".  Several times.  :-)\r\n\r\nI didn't realise any action on a R=go1.7 changeset was unwelcome;  presumably it's generating noise for 1.6's work.  Neither did the changeset's author by the looks of it.  I've re-read https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html and it doesn't mention the \"no talking\" convention when a future-release marker is added.  Nor does https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle that it links to AFAICS.  Nor https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReview, though I don't think that's the right place.",
