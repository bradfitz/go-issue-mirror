	"body": "Brad suggested that I file this bug during the [Happy Eyeballs code review](https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/8768).\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `dialTCP` function will block until the operation succeeds, fails, or times out.  If a dialer decides that the connection is no longer useful, it must be leaked and left to die on its own time.\r\n\r\nInstead, there should be some cancelation mechanism (e.g. a closeable `chan struct{}`) which causes `dialTCP` to clean up its socket and return `errCanceled` immediately.  This might also be exposed via the `Dialer` interface, and for non-TCP protocols, so regular users can take advantage of it.",
