	"title": "proposal: security feature improvement for builtin DNS stub resolver",
	"body": "# Summary\r\n\r\nThis issue gathers and maps security feature proposals for the existing builtin DNS stub resolver from bird's-eye view. For now the builtin DNS stub resolver provides only\r\n\r\n- Insecure DNS RR exchange over insecure DNS transport\r\n\r\nand proposals try to implement any of the following:\r\n\r\n- Secure DNS RR exchange over insecure DNS transport\r\n- Insecure DNS RR exchange over secure DNS transport\r\n- Secure DNS RR exchange over secure DNS transport\r\n\r\n# Protocols\r\n\r\n## Session and presentation\r\n\r\n- EDNS0: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6891\r\n - The well known IP fragmentation-based attack might be out of scope\r\n - Related issues: #6464\r\n- DNSSEC: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033\r\n - DNSSEC requires EDNS0 and cipher suites\r\n - The well-known issue that DNS64 breaks DNSSEC might be out of scope\r\n - Related issues: #13279\r\n- DANE: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698\r\n - DANE requires DNSSEC\r\n\r\n## Transport\r\n\r\n- DNS over TLS: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858\r\n - DNS over TLS requires TLS\r\n- DNS over DTLS: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dprive-dnsodtls\r\n - DNS over DTLS requires DTLS\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\n- Exposed APIs\r\n - A few packages in the golang.org/x/net or golang.org/x/crypto repositories may provide APIs using secure RR exchange over secure DNS transport. So far there is no discussion for adding new APIs into standard packages, there might be a few behavioral changes to standard package APIs though.\r\n- Test cases\r\n - Related issues: #13281, #13295\r\n- Package reorganization\r\n - There probably needs to be a sort of reorganization of related network and crypto packages for avoiding circular dependencies. For example, we cannot use tls.Dial in the net package for constructing DNS over TLS transport because net.Dial is used by tls.Dial.\r\n - Related issues: #11160",
