	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.6.1\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nlinux amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/Fk7G5f3z1q\r\nThe second template takes nil as its data, and accesses its .X field.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI would expect the second template to return an error, just like the first:\r\ntemplate: :1:2: executing \"\" at \u003c.X\u003e: can't evaluate field X in type int\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nThe second template writes out \"\u003cno value\u003e\" and returns no error.\r\nThis seems to correspond to the missingkey=default behaviour, which is documented to happen for maps. I don't think the empty interface should count as a map though, so I would have expected an error instead.\r\n\r\nI can volunteer to provide a fix if the current behaviour is recognized to be a bug.",
