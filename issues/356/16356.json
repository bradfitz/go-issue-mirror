	"body": "Details of the original problem are described in #15823.\r\n\r\nOpening this to request that if there is a go1.6.3 then consider the backported version of the fix for #15823 to be included, noting that the go1.6  backported version of the fix would be simpler than the fix for go 1.7.\r\n\r\nThis is an important fix because it affects the Kubernetes CI but I understand the timing may not work.  I just want my request documented and considered in case it can be included.",
