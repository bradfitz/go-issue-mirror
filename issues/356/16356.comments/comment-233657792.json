None of the potential workarounds/alternatives work (gccgo vendoring doesn't work right now; I can't get shared libraries to work on Power for the huge hyperkube application where this failure occurs.)\r\n\r\nIf there will be a point release for 1.7 in the not too distant future that might be acceptable to them since I believe they want to move to 1.7 anyway.  I just thought if I could get something into a 1.6 release sooner since the fix there is a bit simpler, that would be good so that is why I opened this.\r\n\r\nIf 1.6.4 is possible I can create the CL for it (it is actually a subset of the 1.7 CL and some line numbers might be different.)",
