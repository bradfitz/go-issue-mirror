	"body": "\u003e If you have suggestions to the CL on how to make this less risky and/or more ppc64 specific, then I can change it so it can be considered for 1.7.1.\r\n\r\nThe barrier to point releases (1.7.x) is extremely high. We only fix security issues and bugs with no workarounds. I don't think we've ever had a case where something known broken in Go 1.n(.0), was fixed in Go 1.n.1. Our goal is not accept a point release change if it has even a plausible chance of regressions.\r\n\r\nIf there's a less risky fix, it would normally only go into Go 1.7, not a point release.\r\n\r\nSorry, I know this isn't happy news.\r\n\r\nCan Docker and/or IBM and/or distros or whoever is doing the building of Docker-on-Power carry their own patch?",
