	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe documentation for the Host field of a net/http Request reads:\n\n        // The host on which the URL is sought.            \n        // Per RFC 2616, this is either the value of the Host: header            \n        // or the host name given in the URL itself.                            \n        Host string\n\nThis is somewhat ambiguous, as the Host: header may contain the :port suffix too (RFC\n2616, sec 14.23), but the URL's host component definitely does not include the port\ncomponent (RFC 2396, sec 3.2.2).  So is this field supposed to be:\n\n(a) just the host name, for vanity/virtual hosting purposes (RFC 2616, sec 5.2)?\n  In this case, the docstring should read:\n  // ...this is either the value of the host component of the Host: header ...\n  and the implementation should parse the Host: header.\n\nor (b) the host with optional :port, i.e. the server authority?\n  In this case the docstring should read:\n  // ... or the host name and optional port given in the URL itself.\n  and the implementation should include the url.Port component.  The docstring should probably also include the word \u0026quot;authority\u0026quot; for bonus marks.  \n\nPersonally I think (b) is more useful.  RFC sec 14.23 defines the Host: header as the\nserver authority.\u003c/pre\u003e",
