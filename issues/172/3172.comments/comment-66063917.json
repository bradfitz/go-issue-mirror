But go has to visit a file containing a\n// +build ignore\n\n(or any other unsatisfied build constraint) anyway, as it doesn't know in advance if the\nfile has to be considered for the build or not. Now if this file, which may be part of\nthe build but should be ignored by the constraint, is newer than the executable, the\nexecutable should be rebuilt. I don't see the necessity to save this information in a\nsegment of the executable (which would indeed be an enormous task)\n\nI can live with go clean -t either, and such things don't happen to often anyway.\u003c/pre\u003e",
