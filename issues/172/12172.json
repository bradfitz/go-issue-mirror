	"body": "go version: go 1.5rc1\r\narchitecture: linux-amd64\r\n\r\nWhen you have a vendored package with the same name as a package in GOROOT (e.g. `net/http`), behavior is inconsistent. It seems like other packages within GOROOT get the package in GOROOT, but things not in GOROOT (e.g. your app, other vendored packages) get the vendored version.\r\n\r\nHere's a gist: https://gist.github.com/azylman/305ad6172dd884aaaed4\r\nIn this gist, we have a vendored \"net/http\" and import \"net/http\" and can use our vendored version, but importing \"net/http/httptest\" or \"net/http/httputil\" still work\r\n\r\nHere's a Google Group discussion for context: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/PFaB0hon6ug\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the expected behavior is - if vendoring a package that's the same as GOROOT should work or not, but I'm guessing this inconsistent behavior is not expected.",
