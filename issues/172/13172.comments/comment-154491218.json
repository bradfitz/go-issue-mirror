	"body": "wasn't aware of ndk constraint on api-15.  As mentioned on #13109 I believe the appropriate thing to do is abort on compilation if a manifest declares a minimum api level. The gomobile cmd should then insert the min api tag itself to whatever is decided (+2 to api-15). These are the tentative plans in the issue I linked, but it may be a month or two before that issue is actually resolved.\r\n\r\nIn the interim, there's little reason the current implementation couldn't go ahead and do this now. This would result in the following behavior as related to the reported issue.\r\n\r\n* Specifying a minimum or target api would result in compilation abort and error message logged.\r\n* Attempting to install the resulting apk on an older version of android would result in android reporting that the app is for newer versions of android and abort the install.\r\n\r\nI can put together a CL this weekend if this sounds ok.",
