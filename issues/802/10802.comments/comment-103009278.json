Is it really ok to abandon this, when so simple solution is in the air?\r\n\r\n\u003e filepath.Rel(E:\\Projects\\, E:\\projects\\src) will be wrong too.\r\n\r\nBut you can compare their both lower or uppercase versions. The only problem - before returning the result you'll have to return the substring in original case - it will might be a clunky solution, but still possible.\r\n\r\n\u003e It has no meaning for something like filepath.Rel(c:\\a\\, d:\\a\\b)\r\n\r\nI think it would be trivial to compare both drive letters / isUNC before actual comparsion. So, in your specific example, it would be absolutely ok to return \"Rel can't make ...\" error.",
