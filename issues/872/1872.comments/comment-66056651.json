After all.bash\nand rebuild of my program, I confirm that there is no longer the unexpected messages\nthat was the reason for this issue report.\n\nI do get another unexpected behaviour from my program (reading data from file that looks\nas if it is truncated). However, for the moment I can't say that is not a bug of my own,\nand I will investigate.\u003c/pre\u003e",
