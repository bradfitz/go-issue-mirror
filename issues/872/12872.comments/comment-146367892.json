How does the change in the app package help exp/sensor package avoiding the sender argument?\r\n\r\nSome apps may want to collect and aggregate sensor data using the sensor package but independently of the app package. They may choose to occasionally send the aggregated data to the app.Main's f but, through an independent channel. (for { select { case \u003c- a.Events() , case \u003c- sensorChannel ... } } )\r\nI hope less packages to depend on the app package, so that more packages in mobile repo become available to Gobind apps.",
