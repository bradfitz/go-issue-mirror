If we don't desire to couple any package with the app package, our rewrite attempt is fundamentally wrong. The previous APIs and implementations were completely app package agnostic and were less error prone.\r\n\r\nIf the intention is to decouple the app package, I'd rather revert all the changes to the sensor package and let the users decide whether they would like to pipe the events to the app event channel or not themselves.",
