	"body": "The app package requires the following boilerplate and a closure provided to app.Main. \r\n\r\n``` go\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tapp.Main(func(a app.App) {\r\n        // ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAre there any cases where we will support multiple app.App instances? If not, why don't we just export an App instance from the app package. It may have an accessor that blocks until the app instance is ready.\r\n\r\n``` go\r\nfunc main() {\r\n   a := app.App()\r\n   for e := range a.Events() {\r\n       // ...\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe lack of a globally accessible app instance leads third party packages polluting their APIs. A typical example is the x/exp/sensor package where the Enable function needs to accept a sender implementation in order to dispatch the events to the app event channel. Within the same app, there must be a single App instance and user should never be exposed to third party APIs that requires it as an argument.\r\n\r\n/cc @crawshaw @hyangah ",
