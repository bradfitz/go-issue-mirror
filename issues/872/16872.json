What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version devel +9be2a27 Wed Aug 24 05:08:52 2016 +0000 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"/Users/emmanuelodeke/go/bin\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"darwin\"\r\nGOOS=\"darwin\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/Users/emmanuelodeke/go\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/Users/emmanuelodeke/go/src/go.googlesource.com/go\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/Users/emmanuelodeke/go/src/go.googlesource.com/go/pkg/tool/darwin_amd64\"\r\nCC=\"clang\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fno-caret-diagnostics -Qunused-arguments -fmessage-length=0 -fdebug-prefix-map=/var/folders/v3/7z434qpx5v3bw0wh8h2myfpw0000gn/T/go-build277360793=/tmp/go-build -gno-record-gcc-switches -fno-common\"\r\nCXX=\"clang++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\n Viewed doc/1.7.html and inspected issues https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13382, \r\n  https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16321 and https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16711(which was a duplicate of #16321)\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n Go1.7 docs mentioning crypto fixes:\r\n + x509.tbsCertificate default version fixed to 1 which is encoded on the wire as 0, fixed by CL https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/20548.\r\n + oscp.ResponseData default version fixed to 1 which is encoded on the wire as 0, fixed by CL https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/24841.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nNo mention of the fixes. I didn't want to cause much noise here, but I think mentioning\r\nthese fixes might be useful to crypto folks.\r\nI sought @agl's thoughts here https://twitter.com/odeke_et/status/766184243533930496 on \r\nwhether we should update docs,  but he doesn't know if we can update doc/go1.7\r\nso that's why I've filed this issue.",
