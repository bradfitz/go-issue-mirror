	"title": "encoding/gob: decoding of pointers with two levels of indirection is broken  ",
	"body": "by **martin@remerge.io**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003ego version 1.3.3 (happens at play.golang.org, too)\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\n\n1. Create two structs A and B. \n2. Let B contain an exported int I, and A an exported pointer to a pointer to B named P.\n3. Create an instance of B, set I, create an instance of A and let X point to a pointer\nto the instance of B.\n4. Encode with Gob.\n5. Decode with Gob.\n\n=\u0026gt; The value of I is incorrect.\n\nExample: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/RZj-VdGNvL\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/RZj-VdGNvL\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat happened?\n\nGob does not properly decode pointers with two levels of indirection. It seems that the\ndecoder adds another level of indirection (one to many). Example where you can see this\n:  \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/JkOWiyrHpE\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/JkOWiyrHpE\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nPointers should be decoded correctly.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThere were issues with pointers in the past like :\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=97815e81c184\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=97815e81c184\u003c/a\u003e \n\ndecIndirect in the decoder is called twice with indir = 2 in the decoding process for A.\nThe second or the first call should use 1. I did not look into it deep enough to provide\na fix / suggestion.\u003c/pre\u003e",
