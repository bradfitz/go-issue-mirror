Just now, I do a regression test to make sure it , with the newest version of gomobile.\r\nBy the same procedures steps, it will throw an exception message as below:\r\n```\r\ngomobile: open D:\\Gopath\\pkg\\gomobile\\android-ndk-r10e\\openal\\lib\\armeabi\\libopenal.so: \r\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\r\n```\r\nThe error message is enough clear now.\r\nThanks everybody here.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I noticed that an apk file is still created at the same time.\r\nMmm...  It was an illegal zip format file, but can use 7z to force to see the files structure. \r\nIt just include a empty size file named \"AndroidManifest.xml\".\r\nTherefore,in my opinion, if gomobile could delete it incidentally when the problem happends, it may be more better, more friendly to developers. Just a small suggestion for this :)\r\n\r\n\r\n--------\r\nThank you sincerely.",
