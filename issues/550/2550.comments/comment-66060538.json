Using your\nproposed API, there are two steps to get the file position information: 1) find the\n*ast.File for a node 2) get the position from the *ast.File.  There's one step using the\ncurrent API.\n\nAnother issue is that the file set contains the file data, not the *ast.File. Given that\nthe lexer and other objects need access to the file data, it does not make sense to\nassociate the data with the *ast.File.\u003c/pre\u003e",
