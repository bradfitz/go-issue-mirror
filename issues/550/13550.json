	"body": "In file runtime/race/race.go there is a legacy comment that was last updated before the C code in the runtime was eliminated. That comment's last update in 2014-09-08 yet announcements for ridding the runtime of C code were made in 2015 https://twitter.com/bradfitz/status/598551393608159233\r\n\r\nAnd in particular the confusing one is:\r\n```shell\r\n$ git log | head -n 1 \u0026\u0026 cat race.go | grep -n race.c\r\ncommit 7e1791b97f53bd42808ef2d2e783134b9c3de257\r\n12:// Calls to the runtime are done directly from src/runtime/race.c.\r\n```\r\n```shell\r\n$ cat race.c\r\ncat: race.c: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nAltogether there are 2 confusing comments in runtime/race ie\r\n```shell\r\n$ grep -R '\\w\\+\\/\\w\\+\\.c' * | cut -d\":\" -f1 | sort | uniq | grep \".go\" | while read F;do git blame $F | grep -n '\\w\\+\\/\\w\\+\\.c';done\r\n12:220a6de4 src/pkg/runtime/race/race.go (Russ Cox        2014-09-08 00:06:45 -0400 12) // Calls to the runtime are done directly from src/runtime/race.c.\r\n22:908e1b5e src/pkg/runtime/race/testdata/select_test.go (Dmitriy Vyukov 2012-11-27 15:04:48 +0400  22) \t\t// See comment in runtime/chan.c:^selectgo.\r\n```",
