	"body": "netbsd/386 is consistently failing.  Often it's because of runtime/pprof flaking, but occasionally runtime/pprof actually passes, and then netbsd/386 instead fails because of fixedbugs/issue5162.go.  E.g., see http://build.golang.org/log/5cd606e7c570ce7e74602bf62b09956f4a4b2eed\r\n\r\n    ##### ../test\r\n    # go run run.go -- fixedbugs/issue5162.go\r\n    exit status 1\r\n    go build command-line-arguments: /tmp/gobuilder/netbsd-386-minux-1ccc577b8a34/go/pkg/tool/netbsd_386/8g: signal: killed\r\n    \r\n    FAIL\tfixedbugs/issue5162.go\t79.542s\r\n\r\nIt looks like that test generates a 16000 line .go file, which it then tries to run.  But it seems that 8g is dying with \"signal: killed\" for some reason.  I don't see any reason why Go would be purposefully sending SIGKILL to 8g in this test.\r\n\r\nSomeone with access to a netbsd/386 machine (@minux?), please try running:\r\n\r\n    go run $GOROOT/test/fixedbugs/issue5162.go \u003e bug.go\r\n    go tool 8g bug.go",
