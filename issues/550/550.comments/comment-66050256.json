This was resolved by relaxing the\ntesting conditions (using close instead of veryclose).\n\nI don't think the problem was double rounding in this case. It was the x87 Exp doing a\nnot so great argument reduction. Essentially r=x×lg(e)-round(x×lg(e)). This works well\nin double extended but not so great in double.\n\nBut, I think your CL is enough to re-close this issue. It clarifies the FPU state and\nany accuracy issues can be dealt with separately. Thanks for revisiting.\u003c/pre\u003e",
