The x86 defaults to double extended precision (64-bit significand) and in this\nmode the math routines work well. Changing the x87 to double precision (53-bit\nsignificand) you get nikolai's results.\n\nI think the x87 should be placed into a known state (double extended) or the ASM\nroutines should assume at most double precision.\u003c/pre\u003e",
