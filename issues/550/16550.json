	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.7rc3 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nCompile github.com/mholt/caddy\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nCaddy serves HTTP/2.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nCaddy serves HTTP/1.1 only. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe semantics of net/http/(*Server).Serve() [have changed](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Server.Serve):\r\n\r\n\u003e  If srv.TLSConfig is non-nil and doesn't include the string \"h2\" in Config.NextProtos, HTTP/2 support is not enabled. \r\n\r\nApparently that was not the case with Go 1.6. Caddy used to use (or still uses) an empty slice for NextProtos and HTTP/2 worked fine. Adding \"h2\" works.\r\n\r\n**I did not expect this change**, as it is not mentioned in the Go 1.7 Release Notes DRAFT. Please add a note about that changed behaviour.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSee also mholt/caddy#975.",
