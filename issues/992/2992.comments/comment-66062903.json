Glad you've found the cause.\n\nThen we have two options:\n1, Always assume cgo is present, and do a dynamic linking (the Mach-O spec. says there\nis nothing as static linking Mach-O program, and Mac OS X will always use dyld anyway)\n(If dyld inject a dynamic library into our static linking program, the libSystem will\ninitialize the bsdthread subsystem, and there is not a bsdthread_unregister syscall.)\n2, In non-cgo programs, detect some DYLD_* environment variables before the\nbsdthread_register call. We should exit with error messages if DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES\nis set. We also have to detect this and warning the user during build.\n(Note the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES takes effects even before we start executing, so\nthere is no use unset them when we see it.)\n\nCurrently, I favor the second approach, because the first is too big a change to\nbe undertaken before Go 1.\nIf no objections, I will submit a CL for this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
