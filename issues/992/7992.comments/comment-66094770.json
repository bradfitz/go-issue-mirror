The error indicates that the\ncommand \"go run tmp.go\" was killed by the OOM killer.  Here tmp.go is the output of \"go\nrun rotate.go rotate0.go\" and similarly for rotate1.go through rotate3.go.  By default\non x86 (you are on x86, right?) \"go test\" will run as many programs in parallel as there\nare hyperthreaded CPUs on the system.\n\nThe failing command is \"go run run.go\" executed in the test directory.  Try \"go run\nrun.go -l 1\".  That should run only one of the rotate commands in parallel, reducing the\nchances of the OOM killer doing something.\u003c/pre\u003e",
