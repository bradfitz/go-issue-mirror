(something like that \"where\" for array filtering) I also noticed there is no easy starts-with strings check or other basic string operations like\r\n\r\nIt has simply never been proposed before. Perhaps we should take a look at the primitives provided by `docker-gen` and consider adding them to the default set of template functions. I'll create an issue for that now.\r\n\r\n\u003e Also I would still like to point out that if another application is not as careful with supplying additional helper functions, generic global scope variables could still help people a lot in some scenarios..\r\n\r\nIndeed, but for the reasons I described above I don't think this will happen. Sorry. That being the case, I'm going to close this issue for now.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to report the issue in such detail. Your feedback has been very helpful thus far.",
