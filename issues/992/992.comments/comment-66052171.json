I\nfeel bad because, to be honest, this may actually be my fault, due to my workaround for\nbug 451 somehow.\n\nRemoving it, the crash goes away, but then the code path also changes completely since\nthere are other breaks and tests which aren't run.  To avoid wasting our time, I'll stop\ndebugging this now and will hold off until there's an agreeable fix.\n\nOnce 451 gets fixed, if it turns out to be a real problem in Go, I'll debug further.\u003c/pre\u003e",
