	"body": "As Launchpad now supoprts both git and bzr for codehosting, the currently handling of launchpad.net import paths in cmd/go is not sufficient. Rather than complicating it further, we're going to add appropriate \u003cmeta\u003e tags to the appropriate pages on launchpad (https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/1465467). When that's done, we can just delete the code in cmd/go. It would be nice to get this into 1.5.",
