The same goes for its output.\nThis is uncommon enough that I don't think it is\nworth extra effort in 6l.\n\nIf you really want to, it works right now to do\n    6g -o /dev/stdout /dev/stdin.\n\nbut you have to be aware that 6g also prints\ncompile errors to standard output, so you'd\nhave to check the exit code and even then\nhope that you didn't get some errors and some\nbinary at the same time.  \n\nPlease use files.  That's what they're for.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
