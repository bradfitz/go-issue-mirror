	"body": "It seems that when spaces are inserted in a format string like %#v, some slightly surprising formatting occurs.\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\nGo 1.7.1 (on the Go playground)\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nThe Go playground.\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/2jeholpKdb\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nI would expect to see errors from fmt complaining about invalid format strings, or a literal representation of the string without the formatting applied, or the space simply be ignored. Instead, the formatting is applied in an inconsistent way.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n```\r\nmain.Compound{C:(*main.Compound)(0x1040e130), A:5, B:\"foo\"}\r\nmain.Compound{C:(*main.Compound)( 0x1040e130), A: 5, B:\"foo\"}\r\nmain.Compound{C:(*main.Compound)( 0x1040e130), A: 5, B:\"foo\"}\r\n```",
