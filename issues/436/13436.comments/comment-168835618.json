It sounds like it doesn't happen in the standard build.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I found it when running things with -linkshared in test.\r\n\r\n\u003e I don't expect everything in the test directory to work with -linkshared.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly enough, this is the only spurious failure I see (or saw when I ran this a few weeks back) on any platform that supports -buildmode=shared. (I found some other things but they were real bugs).\r\n\r\n\u003e This could just be working as expected.\r\n\r\nYeah, I think it's the external linker doing something deliberate but slightly surprising. Skipping nilptr when -linkshared is passed would be a perfectly adequate fix I think.",
