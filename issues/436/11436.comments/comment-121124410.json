	"body": "Argh. Launchpad has deployed meta tags on project and series pages, but it's not enough to remove the all special casing in the go tool, because the go tool has support for go getting 'within' a repo:\r\n\r\nimport \"launchpad.net/project/series/sub/directory\"\r\nimport \"launchpad.net/~user/project/branch/sub/directory\"\r\n\r\nand also for handling the fact that import \"launchpad.net/project/foo\" is ambiguous, as explained in a comment:\r\n\r\n// launchpadVCS solves the ambiguity for \"lp.net/project/foo\". In this case,\r\n// \"foo\" could be a series name registered in Launchpad with its own branch,\r\n// and it could also be the name of a directory within the main project\r\n// branch one level up.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what to do about this :( I don't think these features are used very frequently.\r\n\r\nI guess we could add /more/ special casing so that 1) \"launchpad.net/project\" (and that path only) is probed for a meta tag, 2) add handling for git branches (which have different enoughs URLs that a regex can know if git should be used aiui).\r\n\r\nFeels too hard for 1.5 somehow.",
