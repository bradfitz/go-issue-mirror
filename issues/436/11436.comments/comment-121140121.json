Maybe we should put this off until Go 1.6?\n\nOne thing we could do to try to enable a transition in the next six months\nwould be to make launchpad.net import paths prefer the \u003cmeta\u003e tags\nbut fall back to the old logic. That would let launchpad.net fix the \u003cmeta\u003e\nproblem and the go command would follow along.\n\nI sent you this idea in CL 12143. If you think it is useful, we can do it.\nOtherwise we can leave all this for Go 1.6.",
