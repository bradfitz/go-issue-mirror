	"body": "by **Christopher.Pfohl**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat is the expected output?\n\nString types from a database should have a go type of 'string' in Scanner.Scan.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nString types have a go type of `[]byte`\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\nWhatever installed when I apt-get'ed from ppa:duh/golang\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nUbuntu 13.04\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\n1.1.1 linux/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\ndatabase/sql/driver.Rows.Next's documentation states that all strings ought to be\nconverted to []byte\n\ndatabase/sql.Scanner.Scan's documentation suggests that a string is a legitimate type to\nexpect...but all the types that actually *are* strings actually wind up being []byte\nbecause the driver's obey the above documentation (see mgodbc for a case in point, line\n916).\n\nNote, that removing the conversion to []byte still works, so I suspect that the\ndatabase/sql/driver.Rows.Next documentation is simply out of date.\u003c/pre\u003e",
