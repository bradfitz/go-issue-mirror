	"body": "**What version of Go are you using (go version)?** `go version go1.4.2 linux/amd64`\r\n**What operating system and processor architecture are you using?** Ubuntu 14.04\r\n**What did you do?** Run `gofmt` on below code examples\r\n**What did you expect to see?** Consistent spacing of slice indices\r\n\r\nThese are two lines within the same function. They vary slightly, but the interesting part is the `[1:len(key-1]` which has inconsistent spacing. Adding spaces to the first one will result in them being removed when `gofmt` is run, and removing the spaces from the second will only have them added back.\r\n\r\nIf this is not a bug, please let me know what difference here is causing the spacing to change.\r\n\r\n```Go\r\nreturn \"?\" + key[1:len(key)-1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```Go\r\nkey = key[1 : len(key)-1]\r\n```\r\n",
