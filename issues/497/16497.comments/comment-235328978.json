This is a relatively easy fix ([CL](https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/25242/)).\r\n\r\nI know it's scheduled for 1.8 and we're pretty far into the 1.7 release cycle, but it would be nice if this could be snuck in as it almost certainly won't cause problems and fixes some pretty bad behavior.",
