Looking at the code, if both are strings, then no conversion is done. So that\nexplains why strings returned by driver reach their user. That is, I would say, quite\ncommon scenario. And, I agree with you, perhaps documentation shouldn't be as strict.\nEven if things work, we might end up with extra memory allocations that otherwise aren't\nneeded.\n\nI don't see your point about Scanner.Scan. Can you explain more?\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
