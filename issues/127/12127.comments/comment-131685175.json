	"body": "@rin01, your decnum package looks very interesting. In fact I think that a package that supports both fixed size types (`decimal.Single`, `decimal.Double`, `decimal.Quad`) and an arbitrary precision type (`decimal.Number`) for decimal numbers that is modeled after [decnumber](http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decnumber.html) library could be a very good addition to _golang.org/x_ packages. Such package will probably will have to be implemented in pure Go. I don't think that it fits `math/big` package though as the APIs are quite different. Maybe you can create another proposal?\r\n\r\nIf possible I would like to keep this proposal limited to the new `math/big` `Decimal` type with a set of methods similar to `Float` type. The purpose of `big.Decimal` is to provide a standard and consistent API to work with arbitrary precision decimal numbers in Go that will work for 99% of users. And users requiring more control or better performance or different API could look at other packages similar to your `decnum` proposal.\r\n\r\nI will update the proposal with more details as requested by @griesemer soon.",
