I think the basic proposal (functionality, etc.) seems reasonable, but the devil is in the details, and some things may only become clear when an implementation is attempted.\r\n\r\nAn external implementation may be (slightly) less efficient since it cannot use say big.nat - but it's probably marginal. Prototyping it externally also removes any time pressure from getting it done for a specific release.\r\n",
