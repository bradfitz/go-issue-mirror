The exponent is implied. For a positive scale, yes, it would need 1e9 bytes of memory. :cry: \r\n\r\n\u003e E.g. in Cmp you have hi.scale - lo.scale [...] However you do not check for overflow.\r\n\r\nThat line is assuming `max(a, b) - min(a, b)` which won't over or underflow.\r\n\r\nI do think using int32 would be a good idea... and I think I could cut out some extra code since I would have a few more assumptions I could make regarding over and underflows.\r\n\r\nIt'd be great to have another set of eyes on the project -- would you happen have a free moment to go over it? That'd be excellent.\r\n",
