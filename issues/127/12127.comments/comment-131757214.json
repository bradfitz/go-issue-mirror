	"body": "@kostya-sh: I agree with you. This proposal should be limited to math/big Decimal type with similar API to Float type. This would be great and will make the __arbitrary-precision__ package math/big complete in a consistent manner.\r\n\r\n__Fixed-size__ base-10 floating point like decimal128 is another topic and should belong to another package and issue.\r\nJust for info, I am working on my decnum package to make it fully tested, debugged and usable for next week.\r\nThis way, even if a pure Go implementation of decimal128 (aka decnum.Quad) is desirable, it won't be an urgent topic any more.\r\n",
