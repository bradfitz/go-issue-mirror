The guys are using it in production to handle their online sales.\r\n\r\nI am using it myself for some price related computations. I did not know about decnum [3] but will definitely look into it, thanks !\r\n\r\nI would be interested to know what people interested in the decimal proposition think of shopspring/decimal\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nFlorent\r\n\r\n1: https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/decimal.html\r\n2: https://github.com/shopspring/decimal\r\n3: https://github.com/rin01/decnum",
