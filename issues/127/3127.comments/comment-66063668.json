There is no way to get `\"\u0026lt;html\u0026gt;\"` as the marshalled output,\nbut that is fine, since `\"\\u003chtml\\u003e\"` is an equally valid encoding and\nworks in more contexts.  (See also \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/2643\"\u003eissue #2643\u003c/a\u003e and the comment on Marshal.)\n\nI think we should delete MarshalForHTML and add MarshalForHTML -\u0026gt; Marshal\nto the go1rename fix.  It may be necessary to force escaping in the text handed\nback by a custom marshaler while we append it to the accumulated output, but\nthat is cheap and easy.\n\nDavid, you added the escaping here.  Want to do this?\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @dsymonds._",
