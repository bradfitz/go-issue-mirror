	"body": "I thought a little more about this. Currently `dominantField` chooses tag over field name. If we make a change along the way I earlier described (\"union\" instead of \"annihilation\") we now have to answer more questions like: If we have tagged fields, do we set the fields that are untagged anyway?\r\nFurthermore, we will probably want to document this behavior to prevent confusion in the future. It would be confusing if Marshal and Unmarshal follow different rules. Rule for Marshal is already documented, so we might as well follow it.\r\nI am leaning towards retaining the old behavior. Will this need to wait for 1.8? I'd appreciate your thoughts. @bradfitz @rsc ",
