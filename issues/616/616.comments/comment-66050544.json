Using these files in the original gccgo SVN snapshot solved\nthe problem of the missing files.\n\nThough there is still one more error, the \"mime\" package imported in go/http/fs.go is\nnot found during compilation. So I commented out all references to this package and\nlet 'make'/'make install' complete. Then came back to go/http/fs.go, restored the\noriginal file contents and did 'make'/'make install' again. No errors on the second pass.\n\n- Shahzeb\u003c/pre\u003e",
