I find the behaviour of basically ignoring my input if I use a trailing slash to be surprising and unexpected.\r\n\r\nPersonally, it would be more useful to me if -trimpath produced a relative path if I used a trailing slash, and an absolute path if I did not.  That would at least (to me) make some logical sense and would be easy to explain.",
