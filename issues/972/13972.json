	"body": "Referring to: https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/\r\n\r\nIn the \"action\" section it says: \r\n```\r\nHere is the list of actions. \"Arguments\" and \"pipelines\" are evaluations of data, defined in detail below.\r\n```\r\nand later \r\n```\r\n{{pipeline}}\r\n\tThe default textual representation of the value of the pipeline\r\n\tis copied to the output.\r\n```\r\n\r\nin the pipeline section it says\r\n```\r\nPipelines\r\n\r\nA pipeline may be \"chained\" by separating a sequence of commands with pipeline characters '|'. In a chained pipeline, the result of the each command is passed as the last argument of the following command. The output of the final command in the pipeline is the value of the pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe output of a command will be either one value or two values, the second of which has type error. If that second value is present and evaluates to non-nil, execution terminates and the error is returned to the caller of Execute.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom this, it sounds like a pipeline is the result of a command but it is not stated clearly. The first sentence of the pipelines section should start off with a definition of what it is.",
