For example the\ndefinition of io.ReadWriter\nis fine as\n\ntype ReadWriter interface {\n    Reader\n    Writer\n}\n\nand doesn't need the Read and Write methods expanded.  An interface\nwith an embedded\nunexported interface that had exported methods could potentially be\nbrought up the same\nway we do for embedding in structs, but does that actually happen?  I\ndon't think it is a\nhigh priority.\n\nThis bug is really about \"pretend that the predefined interface\n'error' is exported for\nthe purposes of filtering inside an interface type list.\"\u003c/pre\u003e",
