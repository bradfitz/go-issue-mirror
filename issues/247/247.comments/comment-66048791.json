Some kind of fairness\nguarantees are crucial to have in order to make sure that all goroutines can have a\ngo at evaluating.\n\nSo, this isn't an issue about being able to control in what order things are\nhappening. My concern is that some goroutine may never get the chance to do its job\nif the order among receivers is undefined.\u003c/pre\u003e",
