This could be best summarized as \"go does it like linux\".  I've tried my best to do a compact and technically correct summary of this above, but maybe the best thing would be to say \"go does it like linux\" and link to an off-site URL with the gory details. \r\n\r\nI think invoking TAI would actually make it more confusing.  TAI is currently 36 seconds offset from UTC. 26 due to leap-seconds and an additional 10 seconds due to epoch differences.  It's also an incorrect summary of current behavior, since TAI is a monotonic counting of seconds, and the current behavior uses the POSIX system, which is not strictly monotonic when crossing a leapsecond.   However, having said that, using TAI as an internal representation as part of a larger fix seems like a good idea. ",
