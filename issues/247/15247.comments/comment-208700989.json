	"body": "There are no good solutions here but I don't really agree with your proposed docs.  As I see it, the time.Time value is not affected by leap seconds at all.  The question is how we handle methods like Day and Second and Format, and functions like Parse.\r\n\r\nWe actually do have leap second information in the zoneinfo files.  We could even use it, just as we use the zone offset.  We would have to subtract the current leap second offset to gettimeofday when calling time.now.  We would change time.abs to consider leap seconds.  We would change Format and Parse accordingly.  I don't know what the consequences of doing this would be.\r\n\r\nBarring that, it seems to me that we should document that when we say UTC we actually mean TAI, and document that time.Now automatically adds the appropriate number of leap seconds.\r\n\r\n(To be clear, in issue #15190 you say that there is a problem with time.Sub, but I think the problem is actually with time.Parse.)",
