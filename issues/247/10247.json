	"body": "Embedding a web browser is a common strategy for apps that are not heavily focused on UI, on both Android and iOS. The web also provides a very easy way to use other UI systems in a Go application.\r\n\r\nIs there enough commonality between the embedded web views on Android and iOS to build an API usable entirely from Go? The Android WebView has a wide interface and its not clear what subset lines up with iOS. Still, this would be very nice to have.\r\n\r\nAssigning to myself, unless someone else really wants this.\r\n\r\n/cc @hyangah @rakyll ",
