Apple injects a wrapper around each component distributed with Xcode, including open source tools like clang and git, to ensure you've agreed to Apple's licence.\r\n\r\nRunning clang, git, or `xcode-select --install` from the terminal will trigger the interactive licence process and licence your toolchain. You will probably need to repeat this process every time Xcode is updated.",
