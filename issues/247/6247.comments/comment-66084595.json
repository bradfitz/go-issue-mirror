But the negative zero in the real part\ncan be confirmed here: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/CticRlgZj2\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/CticRlgZj2\u003c/a\u003e (is the same code, I'm just\nprinting the real part at the end).\n\nNotes on the code: I'm using Val as interface{} to reduce writing (sorry), and I'm using\ninterfaces because in the real code I'm working with more than complex values.\n\nPlease tell me if you need more details or if there's something I can do.\u003c/pre\u003e",
