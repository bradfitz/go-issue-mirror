What package does the go command want to install?\nCan you also try 'go list -json \u0026lt;that-package\u0026gt;'?\n\nIf you are inside $GOROOT then go install should install the standard\npackages. If you are outside $GOROOT it should not, unless they are\nnot present at all.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
