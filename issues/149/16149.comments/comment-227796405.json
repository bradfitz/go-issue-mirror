When sending a pointer to that variable it will print whatever is in that variable at the moment its printed not what was in the variable when the pointer was taken.\r\n\r\nIf you add a delay after sending the pointer you will see that the output becomes different. \t\t\r\ntime.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)\r\n\r\nWith the delay the range loop usually wont be faster than the routine that selects and prints from the channel. This is only for demonstration of the effect not to be meant as solution to a problem.",
