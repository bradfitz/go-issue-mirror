	"body": "This error means that you have somehow gotten a pointer whose value is 0xc.  The Go runtime is rejecting that pointer value as being invalid.\r\n\r\nOK, I think this is a bug in the support I added for calling mmap when using cgo (https://golang.org/cl/15170).  The call to mmap is failing, with errno 12  (ENOMEM).  But rather than being handled in a reasonable way, it is causing your program to crash.\r\n\r\nNote that even when we fix this, your program is still going to crash, with \"runtime: cannot allocate memory\".  I don't know what changed in Go 1.6 to cause your program to run out of memory.",
