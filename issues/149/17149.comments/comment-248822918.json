	"body": "\u003e It appears that having params on a command, where the command contains a space, breaks the parsing of it.\r\n\r\nGo encodes child process parameters in a way that is understood by most programs. Go uses rules similar to what CommandLineToArgvW implements.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, your child process is cmd.exe (cmd.exe is called to execute the batch file you've requested). And cmd.exe parses its input parameters differently.\r\n\r\nYou can read this very long post http://daviddeley.com/autohotkey/parameters/parameters.htm#WIN about it all.\r\n\r\n\u003e I haven't been able to work around this by experimenting with various ways of quoting the command, using backslashes or slashes, etc.\r\n\r\nYou should stop using exec.Command to build your child process command line, and build it yourself (as per rules described in the doco I mentioned). Then you can pass raw command line to your child process by setting exec.Cmd.SysProcAttr to syscall.SysProcAttr with CmdLine set appropriately.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could fix this problem by changing Go encoding algorithm to use cmd.exe rules every time we execute batch file.\r\n\r\nThere is more of the same discussion on issue #15566.\r\n\r\nAlex",
