	"body": "I think my final pitch for it would be this: One of golang's most awesome features is its ability to run _Examples_ as tests. This proposal basically extends those capabilities to cases where the output might not have been predictable before without also adding significant complexity or new knowledge requirements to use it. It also allows an API to more clearly emphasize return results as unordered which can help sway confusion, much in the same way that the changes to map[] forced people to understand the unordered nature of it. While this would be minimal for implementation side, it could really help on the documentation, and testing side of the house.\r\n\r\nI love tested/documented code, and anything simple that makes writing tests and documentation in makes it easier to complain about those that don't actually take the time to do it! =)",
