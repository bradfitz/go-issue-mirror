Trying to verify that the ordering is random across different runs\nwould be incorrect.\n\nOn Fri, Mar 13, 2015 at 4:24 PM, Brady Catherman \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e @minux \u003chttps://github.com/minux\u003e My worry with that would be that some\n\u003e conditions might make it hard to ensure two runs will have different\n\u003e ordering. For example, the Readdir() example above might return the same\n\u003e order based on file insertion, or based on file name hashes, etc. This\n\u003e depends on the underlying file system implementation (ext vs tmpfs and\n\u003e such) and therefor two runs with the same process and temp directory would\n\u003e return the same results even though the output is still not order assured.\n\u003e Making the test require the output to change might add complexity and\n\u003e introduce possible false failures that could be confusing to somebody\n\u003e debugging.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/10149#issuecomment-78809994\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
