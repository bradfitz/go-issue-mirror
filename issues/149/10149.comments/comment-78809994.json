	"body": "@minux My worry with that would be that some conditions might make it hard to ensure two runs will have different ordering. For example, the Readdir() example above might return the same order based on file insertion, or based on file name hashes, etc. This depends on the underlying file system implementation (ext vs tmpfs and such) and therefor two runs with the same process and temp directory would return the same results even though the output is still not order assured. Making the test require the output to change might add complexity and introduce possible false failures that could be confusing to somebody debugging.",
