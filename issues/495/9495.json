	"body": "I'd like to get OS X builders running in VMs too.\r\n\r\n(Related to #9492 and https://golang.org/s/builderplan)\r\n\r\nLooks like virtualizing OS X 10.7+ is legal (but not 10.6) as long as it's only 1 copy, and on official Apple hardware.  Considering that we already run Go builders on official Mac hardware in the office, we can continue to do so, but with a VM solution.\r\n\r\nAnd looks like VMWare Fusion has the \"vmrun\" command, documented at http://www.vmware.com/pdf/vix162_vmrun_command.pdf , so we can write a little API server that runs on the OS X host and calls vmrun.\r\n\r\n/cc @adg ",
