	"body": "In my experience, \"visual\" error messages on the command line tend to not provide much useful information for seasoned Go programmers - almost always the errors are obvious given the line number and the error report. Instead, they make the output more verbose and hinder productivity. This is especially true when working on a larger code bases where there may be dozens or hundreds of compiler errors at which point the \"graphic\" is just confusing.\r\n\r\nThat said, I can see how visualization can be useful, especially for newcomers to the language or occasional users, where not all language context is \"fully swapped in\". But I wouldn't consider it \"modern\" as @rucuriousyet suggested - we're talking about command-line graphics here, very much a 1970's feature...\r\n\r\nAs @mdempsky pointed out, a new parser coming online will have column information as well which a) would enable this feature, and b) also obsolete it, because - given a sufficiently _modern_ editor - one should be able to position the cursor exactly at the error position.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I wouldn't fight the mechanism if enabled with a flag, but personally I don't think it's useful enough.",
