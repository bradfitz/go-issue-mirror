Up to now I believed we're talking about compile time messages.\r\n\r\n\u003e This feature alone almost made me want to switch to rust!\r\n\r\nPerhaps use some better editor/better editor setup which can quickly point the cursor to the error location based on the compiler output. Then the value of the enhanced error message per se becomes negligible, IMO.",
