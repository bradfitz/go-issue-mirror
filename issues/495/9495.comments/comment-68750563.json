But some of our net tests require root, or at least more capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe script you'll want to run as root is just:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nset -e\r\ncurl --fail -o /usr/local/bin/buildlet https://storage.googleapis.com/go-builder-data/buildlet.darwin-amd64\r\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/buildlet\r\nexec /usr/local/bin/buildlet\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat should work already.  Be careful with that server: it is a remote code execution daemon.  Don't run it on your real machine if it's exposed to the internet.\r\n\r\nBut you should be able to hit it in a VM and see it reply \"I am a buildlet\" or whatever at its root path.\r\n",
