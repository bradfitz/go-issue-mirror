It might be more convenient for the API if they run on boot as there won't be need to log into the guest OS in order to make the script run. As I mentioned in our email thread, this can be done through Launchd. There is more information about Launchd here: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/BPSystemStartup.pdf\r\n\r\n ",
