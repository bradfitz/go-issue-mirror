Maybe 10.7 too. So can I just buy those OS X discs from Apple somehow if I can no longer find my original CDs? Or do I need \"Server CDs\"?  I know you're not a lawyer, and I'm not asking for legal advice. We're definitely not looking to avoid paying for things.  I'm happy giving Apple plenty of (more) money here... I just want to know technically what's required, once we pay for all the parts the Apple-sanctioned ways.\r\n",
