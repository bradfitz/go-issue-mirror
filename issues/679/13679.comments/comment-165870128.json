	"body": "I chose panic when writing the code by analogy to operations like making a slice that is too large: the user is passing invalid data to a runtime function.  If the code could return an error, that would be better still, but it can't.\r\n\r\nI'm not strongly opposed to throw, but to me this feels like more like a run-time panic.  The case of #13677 doesn't seem to argue one way or another.  There are perfectly normal operations that that could cause a driver to panic.",
