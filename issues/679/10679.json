	"body": "Is it possible to add a flag for goimports to only work on the stdlib? (i.e. ignoring GOPATH)\r\n\r\nReasons:\r\n1. parsing GOPATH on a spinning hard disk with a large src size (e.g 1G) takes a long time\r\n2. if you are importing 3rd party lib, you are probably adding the imports yourself at the beginning\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the cost of parsing GOPATH is not worth the benefit for some users, so adding a flag to goimports can improve their productivity. (e.g. avoid freezing the editor on save)",
