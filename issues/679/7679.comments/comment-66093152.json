I want to start fixing another issue in astutil,\nbut it's harder to do until this one is fixed.\n\nAbove, I've provided:\n\n- Reproducible steps that demonstrate the problem.\n- A detailed analysis of the code explaining where the root problem lies (and how it\ncame to be, linking to the relevant revision).\n- A new failing test case.\n- A sample patch that fixes the problem and makes all tests pass.\n\nAnything else I can do to help? The only thing I can think of would be going through the\nsteps at \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/contribute.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/contribute.html\u003c/a\u003e and trying to create my first CL - should\nI be doing that? Thank you!\u003c/pre\u003e",
