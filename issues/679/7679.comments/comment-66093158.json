I see how 7132 is\nrelated.\n\nBasically, there are two issues. One, lower level, in astutil.DeleteImport. It has\nexisted since astutil's conception, but was largely dormant. The other, higher level, in\ngoimports, which makes use of astutil. 7132 made was an incomplete fix that handles most\ncases in goimports (unrelated to astutil), except the one that's covered by this issue.\n\nFixing the lower level issue in astutil fixes the higher level one in goimports. I may\nwant to add a test case for goimports too, just to have complete coverage of both issues.\u003c/pre\u003e",
