	"body": "Usually the runtime throws when it finds heap corruption or other pointer misuse. The new cgo checks panic instead. Perhaps they should throw. Panicking uncovered #13677, which we should fix separately anyway. Even so, the behavior would have been clearer had the cgo check used throw, and throw is more consistent with the rest of the runtime.\n\nThoughts?\n\n/cc @ianlancetaylor",
