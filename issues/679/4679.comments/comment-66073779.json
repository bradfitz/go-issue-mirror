(I think one can read\n\"a Pointer\" as \"a value of an unsafe.Pointer type\".) Gccgo originally\nbehaved as requested in this bug, but Ian changed it to match 6g. The\nreflect package uses this functionality. It would not be hard to remove but\nI also wonder if others are using it. To avoid breaking things, I am\ninclined to reword the spec to match what the two compilers do.\u003c/pre\u003e",
