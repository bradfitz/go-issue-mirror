As has been pointed out in #1, doing this correctly\nassumes detailed knowledge of font sizes which was an explicit non-goal.\n\nThere may be heuristics that work reasonably well (#2), but it won't solve the problem\nfor people using proportional fonts for programming (which would be the right thing to\ndo for readability).\n\nBut even if this information were available, formatting it for one person using one\neditor and font does not help another person using a different editor and font.\n\ngofmt used to have a mode where all alignment was indicated with tabs (as one would do\non a mechanical type writer, with the tabs properly set for each section), and the idea\nwas that perhaps at some point an editor (or editor \"plug-in\") would come along that\nwould do the job that text/tabwriter is doing now. Having such an editor would make code\nlook properly aligned no matter what font or character one is using.\n\nAlbeit, we're not yet in the 21st century proper when it comes to source code editing.\nClosing as unfortunate.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
