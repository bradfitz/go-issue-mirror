It may have been the root cause of the _AddVectoredContinueHandler not working previously for all I know, as now it seems to work. That is to say, I doubt your recent change was the cause, just what tickled it again.\r\n\r\nLastly, we could be tickling a windows bug differently each time as it appears only on XP/2003 64-bit. I have doubts about that option, but we should hold it in mind.\r\n\r\nI could give you access to the builder through a tunneled rdp if you'd like. Let me know and I'll send you an email with specifics.",
