If you effectively revert https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/8165 , that is use _AddVectoredContinueHandler on XP amd64 then this test works again. Maybe previously one of the callbacks was getting overwritten? Although that begs the question why _SetUnhandledExceptionFilter stopped working.\r\n\r\nNote: can't do a clean revert as some of the logic has moved from os1_windows.go to signal_windows.go.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can help do something to try to pin the source of the failures down more. Thanks for noticing this.\r\n-Daniel",
