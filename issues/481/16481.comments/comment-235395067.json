The bug was introduced in Go 1.6, so arguably it's not Go 1.7 material since it's not a 1.6-\u003e1.7 regression, but it's a pretty bad case (things fail to work) and there's no real workaround. I'm surprised nobody has reported it previously. It would only take effect for certain traffic patterns where things were aborted without reading bodies.\r\n",
