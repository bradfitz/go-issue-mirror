	"body": "@wujieliulan, the behavior for your h2test.tar.gz test program looks correct per the spec with the default of conn-level flow control and stream-level flow control being equal. You have one stream exhausting the conn-level flow control and blocking forever, so it makes sense that the other one can't proceed.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could have different default flow control values, having more for the conn so a single bad stream can't have such impact. Can you file a separate bug for that? This one is now closed and we don't reuse bugs. Feel free to reference this one in your new bug report.\r\n",
