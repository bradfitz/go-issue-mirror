If anything this could be made clearer in the docs.\r\n\r\nCorrect usage of io.SizedReaderAt with an os.File would be to wrap it in io.SectionReader with the results of a previous os.Stat-call. Then the ReadAt-Method will correctly report an error.\r\n\r\nI could prepare a CL with a better example here.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Undoing a days long discussion for a years long feature request in just 3h is a bit fast, isn't it?",
