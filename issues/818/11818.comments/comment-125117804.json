It is an experiment, although it will hopefully influence golang.org/x/mobile/app in the medium term.\r\n\r\nBeing official or not matters little. The question is how much commitment exists behind it, both in technical terms and in community management terms, so that there's at least some small chance that it becomes more than a toy at some point.",
