	"body": "For the record, despite being the author of Go QML, I'm in full support of a native toolkit for Go that the community gets strongly behind. The reason Go QML exists is because it is a cheap way to go fast forward towards GUI applications in Go, leveraging a complete and modern toolkit. Conversely, implementing a full graphical toolkit in Go is a major undertaking, and to be honest pushing such a project naively will most likely do more damage to the ecosystem than otherwise, as it splits attention across several half baked offerings (x/mobile? google/xgui? x/shiny? etc). I wish someone that really cares for GUIs and knows how to organize a community could take the lead on this, and stick with it for a longer while.",
