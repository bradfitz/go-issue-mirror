Should I just copy the RGB components of the pre-multiplied RGBA color onto the drawing surface in the case of draw.Src?\r\n\r\nGeneral question: how should we handle situations where only part of the window needs to be redrawn? All the painting models I'm familiar with, including X11 expose, work this way.",
