Should we barf in that case?  I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nIf these constants are really constant, then this code is kind of silly.  But probably at least one is a constant dependent on GOARCH or GOOS, in which case it starts to make sense.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could have a \"poison\" constant which is generated by a constant divide-by-zero and if that poison constant is ever used, then the compiler fails.",
