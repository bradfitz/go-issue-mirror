Relaying on an implementation detail to avoid data leaking doesn't sounds right to me nor I believe people responsible(i.e. sane) with sensitive data do that. Not to mention that the behaviour is unstable and prone to errors because if one conflicting field is removed the data is leaked from the other one.\r\n\r\n``Handling of anonymous struct fields is new in Go 1.1. Prior to Go 1.1, anonymous struct fields were ignored. To force ignoring of an anonymous struct field in both current and earlier versions, give the field a JSON tag of \"-\".``",
