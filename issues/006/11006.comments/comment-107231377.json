	"body": "I fail to see how marshalling the \"conflicting\" fields would cause a breaking change. \r\n  The behaviour changes only for the fields that are currently ignored. The fact that the conflicting fields are ignored is a limitation/restriction of the package which is surpassed by provision. The developer shouldn't expect guarantees to have these fields ignored regardless their conflicting status unless it uses  a  `json:\"-\"` tag in the struct definition.\r\n  The existing documented behaviour doesn't change more than it was changed in 1.1. Basically it marshals more anonymous fields that were otherwise ignored due special rules. \r\n    Shortly said if the developer doesn't use the `json:\"-\"` it has no guarantee that the field won't be marshalled thus the reason why it's not a breaking change. \r\n A breaking change in the behaviour would only exist if existing marshalled fields would stop being marshalled or their structure would change.",
