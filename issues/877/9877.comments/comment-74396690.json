It's also easier to see the big picture this way - special cases are handled in the prose.\r\n\r\nNote that the correct fix would be more complicated than your suggestion because you can have a variadic parameter in the first position (no leading \",\" in that case), as in:\r\n\r\nfunc f(...T)\r\n\r\nIf you have a correct suggestion that's just as simple as what we have now, I'm happy to consider it.\r\n\r\nFinally, even for a parser it makes sense to accept a wider syntax (and have the restrictions checked separately) because it permits better error handling.",
