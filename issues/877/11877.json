	"body": "In https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/uInF2v-rfqY/VN0VVGfGHM0J, the author expresses confusion at the statement \"Seeking to a negative offset is an error\". This is reasonable, considering that the name of the first parameter is \"offset\", and providing a negative value for that argument is not necessarily an error.\r\n\r\nMaybe it can be reworded to reduce the ambiguity.",
