	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCurrently, the ssh packages uses a 16 KB window size for all channels. Given the\nwindowing mechanism, this pretty much limits transfer rates to 16 KB * RTT which can be\nvery little indeed for high latency connections.\n\nOpenSSH uses a max packet size if 32 KB (as does go.crypto/ssh) and a window size of 64\n* packet size (i.e. 2 MB) for session and tcpip channels. (See CHAN_SES_WINDOW_DEFAULT\nand friends in channels.h in the OpenSSH code).\n\nThis patch updates go.crypto/ssh to do the same. For my use cases it bumps transfer\nrates for high latency connections from unusable to comfortable.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/6675/0/window-size.diff\"\u003ewindow-size.diff\u003c/a\u003e (2097 bytes)",
