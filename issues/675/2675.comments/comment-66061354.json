It looks like somehow the\ntls pointer is being set to \u0026m-\u003etls[0] instead of \u0026m-\u003etls[0] + 2*sizeof(uintptr), at\nleast if uc-\u003euc_mcontext.gsbase is to believed.  This would happen if setldt were being\nignored and thr_new's param.tls_base were used instead.  However, I tried fixing\nparam.tls_base and commenting out the settls in thr_start and that did not fix anything.\n\nSince this only happens on a cross-compile, I think this can wait until after Go 1.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-go1**._",
