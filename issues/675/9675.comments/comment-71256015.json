	"body": "That is a failure while handling a Go file that uses import \"C\".  The go tool runs a small link in order to see  which symbols will be defined by shared libraries.  This link normally succeeds because the final link normally succeeds.  We can't skip this link, though.  We need to know that information in order to generate correct Go code in general.  I don't think there is any clean way to handle this.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could provide dummy definitions of your symbols and #cgo LDFLAGS to pick up the dummy definitions.  I don't know whether that would work or not.",
