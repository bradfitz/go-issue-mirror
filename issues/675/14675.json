What did you do?\r\nTest returning of EOF and unexpected EOF\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/RJfp3HgcQ5\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nThe last read should return EOF\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nThe last read returns UnexpectedEOF\r\nThe issue was triggered by b1797390b95d1ffd3d97b19532bf451719d42fd5 , which introduced unexpected EOF for truncated streams.\r\n\r\nI'm not certain, if the io.Read() interface guarantees that calls after the first one that returned EOF should also return EOF, but returning \"unexpected EOF\" is definitely unexpected.",
