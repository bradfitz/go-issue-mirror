It is likely\ndifferent on each call.\n\nWe could record something at runtime, but then we already do.  The first argument to\ncall16 is a FuncVal* for which  we can read the function pointer, look up the Func*, and\nwe have the info.  We'd then just need to special case traceback_*.c to know how to\ncompute the argument info for the call* routines.\u003c/pre\u003e",
