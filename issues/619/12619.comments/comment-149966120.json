Personally I had to attend to wild cases of bad memory GC on various devices and especially on pre 4.4 devices where memory leaks are present within android itself. \r\n\r\nThe issue will manifest themselves if we pass a lot of large strings or byte arrays which are copied in and out of Seq. \r\n\r\nLow hanging fruit:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public static void FuncWithNoParamsAndNoReturns() {\r\n        Seq var0 = new Seq();\r\n        Seq var1 = new Seq();\r\n        Seq.send(\"myclass\", 10, var0, var1);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan be parsed to following and removes 2 java Seq allocations just by checking the number of return vars and params count in gobind.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public static void FuncWithNoParamsAndNoReturns() {\r\n        Seq.send(\"myclass\", 10, null, null);\r\n    }\r\n```",
