	"body": "The lifecycle model is complicated, but I'm not convinced it's too complicated. Apps have a lot of fundamental states. My old model hid a lot of stages that a typical game-like app doesn't need, but it's not clear that was the right approach. My thinking on this is that simpler app models belong at a higher level. For example if exp/sprite got a 2D game engine (even as an optional extra package), it could end up managing lifecycle for a user and presenting a much higher-level interface. Similarly an all-Go UI could provide an optional management system that took care of the primary event loop for some common class of apps.\r\n\r\nAs to the notion that it's of Go invention, that's true, but I given the general confusion I've seen over the Android/iOS models I don't expect users to come in with a good understanding of any of those systems.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what \"pushed to the user\" means. Could you elaborate?",
