	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version devel +149ac34 Mon May 9 17:50:29 2016 +0000 linux/ppc64le\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"ppc64le\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nI noticed that the current port for Power does not support vector (VMX/Altivec) registers and instructions.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nVector registers and instructions support are important to enable performance optimization for runtime packages on Power. Those should be implemented.\r\n\r\nI have a change to add the initial support for the VMX instructions, starting with the vector registers and X-form load/store instructions.\r\n\r\n",
