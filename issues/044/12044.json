	"body": "I have some CGO_CFLAGS and CGO_LDFLAGS settings I have to use to build a project I have, but gorename inside emacs doesn't have access to those. \r\n\r\ngorename fails on this project (and ones that depend on it) because it cannot find the C headers. However, gorename doesn't support cgo and so doesn't really need to inspect those headers.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice for rename to not care about cgo so that we didn't have to mess with cgo's env variables for each project (esp since some might, in rare cases, have conflicting needs).",
