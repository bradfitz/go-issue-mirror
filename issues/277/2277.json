There is no other write w' to v that happens after w but before r.\n\nThis definition doesn't seem necessary for the rest of the document.\nOne line seems to contradict it:\n\u0026gt; Note that a read r may observe the value written by a write w that happens\nconcurrently with r. Even if this occurs, it does not imply that reads happening after r\nwill observe writes that happened before w.\n\nIf \u0026quot;w happens concurrently with r\u0026quot; is true, then \u0026quot;w happens before r\u0026quot;\nis false by definition.\n\nA more consistent definition of allowed might replace the first\ncondition with:\n1. r does not happen before w\n\nShould such a replacement be considered?\n\nWhat motivates defining allowed (rather than only defining\nguaranteed)?\n\nLeaving \u0026quot;allowed\u0026quot; out of the model entirely might not be bad in light\nof some previous posts: \u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/ba17c1ab71357629\"\u003ehttp://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/ba17c1ab71357629\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/75caf6fbe3b24cca\"\u003ehttp://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/75caf6fbe3b24cca\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/8b1adf2a50f0dcb7\"\u003ehttp://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/8b1adf2a50f0dcb7\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThanks,\nAndrew Hart\u003c/pre\u003e",
