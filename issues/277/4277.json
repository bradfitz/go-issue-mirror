What is a short input program that triggers the error?\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfmt.Println(-3\u0026gt;-5)\n\tfmt.Println(-5\u0026lt;-3)\n}\n\n2. What is the full compiler output?\nprog.go:9: send statement -5 \u0026lt;- 3 used as value; use select for non-blocking send\n\n3. What version of the compiler are you using?  (Run it with the -V flag.)\n1.0.3\n\n\nComment: This doesn't really make all that much sense. There's no way to use a\n\u0026quot;negative\u0026quot; channel (-c), and there's no way to receive something from a\nnon-channel. Why does the lexer decide it absolutely has to be a case of channel receive\nrather than a simple comparison?\u003c/pre\u003e",
