That's slightly hazardous since you could have made local changes on that branch that you didn't get to pushing, and someone else may have submitted your change (or you did it from another computer). The safest might be to run `git rebase @{u}` on each branch, which will quietly drop the commit if it's been merged exactly (i.e. there were no diffs that weren't applied upstream).",
