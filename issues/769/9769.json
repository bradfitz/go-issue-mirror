	"body": "If you are on a Mac and you run (say) GOOS=linux GOARCH=ppc64 go install cmd/go, it needs somewhere to write the binary, and $GOROOT/bin/go has the Mac copy of the go command, so it uses $GOROOT/bin/linux_ppc64/go. So far so good.\r\n\r\nBut if $GOBIN is set, it uses $GOBIN/linux_ppc64/go. Since $GOBIN is not under Go's control (not part of $GOROOT's conventions) we should not be creating subdirectories. The install command should report an error instead.\r\n\r\n@robpike just ran into this with GOARCH=386 set.",
