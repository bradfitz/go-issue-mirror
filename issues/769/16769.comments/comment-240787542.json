	"body": "\u003e Keith, how can use of unsafe not be a security violation in general?\r\n\r\nPackage unsafe documents several patterns that users are allowed to assume will remain safe, one of which includes (at least by my best interpretation) converting `*uint64` to `*uint16`.  If there were *no* safe uses of package unsafe, then there wouldn't be any point in providing it.\r\n\r\n\u003e What prevents taking address of auto, casting to *byte[100000], and happily iterating over it?\r\n\r\nThat's not one of the patterns that are documented to be safe.  Conversion of `*T1` to `*T2` is only safe if `Sizeof(T2) \u003c= Sizeof(T1)`, which won't be true in the scenario you're asking about (since we don't allocate 100,000+ byte objects on the stack).\r\n\r\n\u003e and it was already broken,\r\n\r\nDo you mean that the pre-SSA compiler didn't support conversions from `*uint64` to `*uint16` either?  Or you think the user code was broken for relying on patterns that you don't agree should be valid?",
