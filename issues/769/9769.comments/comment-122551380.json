	"body": "Closing this bug means completely killing `go install` support for cross compilation. I can now probably simulate the previous `go install` cleverness by using Makefile and `go build -o`, but it's a sad moment that Makefile is now required where previously `go install` was everything that was needed.\r\n\r\nCan this issue please be revisited. I really liked the way this worked before, native binaries to $GOPATH/bin, cross-compiled to $GOPATH/bin/$GOOS_$GOARCH, it was a great FEATURE!",
