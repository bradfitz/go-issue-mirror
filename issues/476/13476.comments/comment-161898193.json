The cbOutBuffer parameter specifies the length of the output buffer. The number of interfaces returned (number of structures returned in the buffer pointed to by lpvOutBuffer parameter) can be determined based on the actual length of the output buffer returned in lpcbBytesReturned parameter.\r\n\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms741621(v=vs.85).aspx\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?  Is it still necessary to traverse the INTERFACE_INFOs as a linked list rather than an array for some reason?\r\n\r\n(Note: I have almost no experience with Windows programming, so I'm just making a best effort here until someone who knows what they're doing takes over. :-))",
