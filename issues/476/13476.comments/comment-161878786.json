At least on Linux and OpenBSD, we still list interfaces even if they're down and down have addresses, which seems consistent with the documentation for net.Interfaces.\r\n\r\nI also note the HardwareAddr for interface 7 changed from \"a4:db:30:fe:d8:e1\" to \"a4:db:30:fe:d8:e1**:00:00**\".  Linux and OpenBSD both report addresses in MAC-48 (6 octet) form, and if it was to be converted to EUI-64 (8 octet) form I would think it should be \"a4:db:30:**ff:ff**:fe:d8:e1\" (or maybe \"a4:db:30:**ff:fe**:fe:d8:e1\"), no?",
