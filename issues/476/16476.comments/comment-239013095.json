	"body": "@randall77 : The sharing of `mayhavework` is intentional. Assuming `mayhavework` is a Boolean (byte) array, the typical spinner will have access to information for all configured Ps in a single cache line. This status is rarely updated but often read, so the shared line is not a problem. Storing `mayhavework` with each P would largely defeat the purpose, which is to remove the need for every spinner to randomly pull in one or more remote cache lines from P's that are idle. ",
