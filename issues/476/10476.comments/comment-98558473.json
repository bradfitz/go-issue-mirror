Sadly on those processors the TSC counter is not coherent\n\u003e across cores and is affected by power scaling. The only way I know how to\n\u003e make the TSC reliable on that cpu is to pin it to a core, which isn't easy\n\u003e from user space, and really isn't easy without root.\n\n\nyou can use taskset(1) to pin a process to a set of cores, without root.\n",
