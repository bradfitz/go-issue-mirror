Currently the net package doesn't provide any timing information at all, so this would add an entirely new kind of API that we would have to support forever.  I really don't see this happening.\r\n\r\nIf you can figure out some way to implement this without making the net package more complex and without changing any of the existing API, please follow the proposal process to suggest it (https://github.com/golang/proposal#readme).",
