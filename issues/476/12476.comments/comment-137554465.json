	"body": "I thought about doing that, but can't. When Dialer.Dial resolves the hostname, it gets all addresses, and tries to fallback to different IP if one of them is not available. It also implements DualStack (Happy eyeballs). \r\n\r\nIf I resolve by hand, I need to select an IP to connect to, and possibly would have reproduce the complex retry/fallback logic in the net package.\r\n\r\nResolving IP by hand would work if Dialer would have some Dial method which took a list of ips as input instead of single address. Tomorrow, I will make a new issue proposing just that.",
