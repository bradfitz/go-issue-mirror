The current behavior uses the magic string \"json\", and it\nwould be nice to be able to change this. This would give the nice behavior without\npromoting use of multiple tags by having it be on an exported function.\n\nI'd really love to be able to pass a tag string to the encoder/decoder to make it easy\nto input/output different representations of a struct.  It keeps all representations in\na single authoritative location, and allows use of a consistent, easily understood\nmethod for doing so, for a pretty trivial change.\u003c/pre\u003e",
