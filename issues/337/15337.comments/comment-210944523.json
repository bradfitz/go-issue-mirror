I lost interest.\r\n\r\nI might try XP on physical hardware with an iSCSI boot so each boot gets the same image (with an Intel server NIC which makes iSCSI look like a local disk) + an APC PDU which lets me cycle its power to reboot it.\r\n\r\nI'm not interested in Wine.\r\n\r\nBut setting an environment variable or build tag to disable certain DLLs and test our optional-DLL codepaths is very easy. I plan to do that.\r\n",
