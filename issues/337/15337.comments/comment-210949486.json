We already cheating with windows-386 builder - it is not running on real 32 bit OS, it is running in Microsoft provided emulator inside 64 bit OS. The emulator is very good, but ...\r\n\r\nWindows XP runs fine emulated. I use Oracle VM VirtualBox. My friends run Windows XP in VMWare.\r\n\r\nYou always will have me to test what you need. XP is one of my development boxes. I am not changing it for the next year or two. You can use VirtualBox and create Windows XP yourself so you can test things when need be.\r\n\r\nWindows XP is going. Pretty much everything in Go works on Windows XP at this moment. So if things starting to break there, and no users complaining, I am fine letting it Go.\r\n\r\nAlex",
