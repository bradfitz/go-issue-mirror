If you send me an email, I'll reply with the file.\n\nOnce you see the stack trace, the bug in my own code is pretty plain: Whenever the file\nfails to be created, Close() is later called on nil. Might be that with root it's just\nless likely for the file failing to be created.\n\nThis is good news, since I can easily fix this. Still, it would be interesting to know\nwhy we never saw a stack trace. If we had, this wouldn't have been such a mystery bug in\nthe first place.\u003c/pre\u003e",
