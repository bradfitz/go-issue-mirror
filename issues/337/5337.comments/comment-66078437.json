Yesterday was a holiday around here and I just returned to the\noffice.\n\nBad news:\nAfter I fixed the bug and deployed the changes, the process crashed again with the same\nsymptoms shortly after.\nI believe that the bug that triggered the stack trace in comment #7 has nothing to do\nwith the originally reported crash and was only accidentally triggered while trying to\nget a stack trace.\n\nLooks like we're back to square one. For now, we'll keep trying to get a stack trace for\nthe crash. I'll report back once I know more.\n\nRegarding the Go 1.1 tag (re #16):\nI fear I can't really judge if this should be a blocker or not. Obviously these crashes\nare a big deal for us and the lack of a stack trace really makes hard to find out what\nis actually going on.\u003c/pre\u003e",
