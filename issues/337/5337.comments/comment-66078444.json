Can you please audit your code, and any dependencies for calls\nto os.Exit(0).\n\nRe 4. If you're not explicitly using cgo (it is unlikely you'd not know you were using\nit) then we can rule this out. Running ldd on the final binary will be the best test.\n\n5. Yes, although it should be less of an issue if you are not using cgo to embed a\nforeign library. \n\n6. Pass CGO_ENABLED=0 when building Go.\n\n7. is a real concern. Can you please run your process with the flag, GOGCTRACE=1 and\npost the full output from startup to restart/crash. If your process reaches 16Gb, you\nwill get a panic because the heap in 1.0.x had a maximum size of 16Gb.\n\n8. Btw, you're not stripping your binaries by chance ?\u003c/pre\u003e",
