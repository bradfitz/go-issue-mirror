Is it possible there is an intermediary\nwrapper that is swallowing the error?\n\n2. Can you provide that core file somehow ?\n\n3. The termination of the process with no notification (although I cannot explain the\nzero error code) is a strong indication that something is hitting your process with a\nkill -9. Can you please add some detail about the host your are running on. You've\nalready mentioned it was compiled on a ubuntu system but deployed on RHEL 6. \n\n4. Does your application use cgo (apart from the net pkg) ?\n\n5. Have you tried compiling your application on the same host that you run the\napplication ?\n\n6. Have you tried building your application with cgo disabled ?\n\n7. How much memory does your RHEL6 host have available ? What other processes is it\nsharing resources with ? What is the usual RSS of your application when running ? Does\nthis fluctuate, or does it approach a steady state ?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nDave\u003c/pre\u003e",
