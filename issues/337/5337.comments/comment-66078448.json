What are you using for process management ? Is it possible there is an intermediary\nwrapper that is swallowing the error?\n\nWe used supervisord when we first saw this, but as Hanno mentioned, I simply ran it\ninside tmux and triggered the most recent crash - so I saw in my terminal that it just\n\"ended\" and exited 0. Its also worth noting that despite exiting 0, we got a core file,\nso I dont think os.Exit(0) is guilty.\n\n7. How much memory does your RHEL6 host have available ? What other processes is it\nsharing resources with ? What is the usual RSS of your application when running ? Does\nthis fluctuate, or does it approach a steady state ?\n\nThe server has 96G of RAM,  looking at the monitoring graphs from yesterday it never\ndropped below 50G in \"free\" RAM. However, I believe we may have some issues with kernel\nmemory allocations; we have a very large number of connections to this box (the only\nother process using much resources is haproxy, and that has a very small RSS and CPU\nload - just a huge number of open files, TCP connections etc.)\n\nThe RSS of the go process does seem to increase rapidly to around 5G and then slowly\nincrease over time. The longest run time we have seen, I think 5 days when running as\nroot, got the overall RSS to the 10-15G mark (sorry, I do not recall the exact figure).\n\nI am not sure if the Socket errors we saw in dmesg could help explain the trigger for\nthis condition, or if there is some kernel memory pressure that we did not see any\nevidence of.\n\nThe kernel is 2.6.32-279.el6.x86_64.\u003c/pre\u003e",
