Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.7.1\r\n\r\nWhen running a large number of tests or benchmarks, the test timeout in src/cmd/go/test.go is hard coded to 10 minutes\r\n\r\nThis means that the `-test.count` parameter is not taken into account, when in fact it should be.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
