	"body": "As I said above I understand the desire to eschew all flags. On the other hand optimizers often have bugs and I have found the ability to have some control over them vital to my productivity over the years. e.g. I would have been blocked but I could proceed with the optimizer turned off.\r\n\r\nYou point about go get and packages it well taken and true.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is you will have a very hard time finding universal constants for hariness and level and people like me will be frustrated with your choice because you end up saying, \"geez if hariness was just 1o more this would inline\" and ditto for level. Or there is some onscure case that's broken for level n and the expediant fix is to decrement level by one until some other issue is fixed.\r\n\r\nHere is a proposal.\r\n\r\n**Could source files contain a comment ala build tags that describes what kind of optimizations and other flags are needed? The benefits are probably obvious but I'll state them to be complete.**\r\n\r\n1. The action is strictly local to a single go file\r\n2. Any compiler implementation is free to ignore them because they are comments\r\n\r\n\"Comment control\" was just added for \"go generate\" so there is a precendent.\r\n",
