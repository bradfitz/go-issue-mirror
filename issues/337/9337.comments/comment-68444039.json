Everything here is related to the inliner and optimization.\r\n\r\n3. \" The compiler should do the right thing by default\" didn't come from me. I think over the long term that's the correct approach. In the short and medium term other apporaches should be considered.\r\n\r\nMust upsetting to me is the perception that I am complaining. I think frustrated would be better word. With a little effort the Go inliner could be much more effective. It's low hanging fruit.\r\n\r\n4. My bad. I'll restate that.",
