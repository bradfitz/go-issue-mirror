A single PC can be associated with a whole\n\u003e stack of inlined functions, and DWARF supports this. That will improve\n\u003e current situation as well, because currently we miss frames in CPU profiles\n\u003e and during nil derefs in inlined functions.\n\u003e\nDWARF supports everything. But we certainly don't want to base our\nbacktrace support\non DWARF.\n\nIf we support showing backtraces for inlined functions, ideally I still\nwant to see the argument\nvalues dump like we do now, but on the other hand, that's close to\nimpossible to implement\nwithout invalidating all the benefit of inlining.",
