While it's an admirable goal to support complete backtraces for inlined functions I don't know if that needs to be a prerequisite to the inlining work. I'd be willing to live with a switch to turn inlining on and off.\r\n\r\n2. I haven't checked yet but If the new (1.5+) compiler has some *temporary* flags for control variables such as hairiness, depth, and inline on/off I'd be willing to spend some time working through the various hash functions I have as well as parts of the Go standard library to find some reasonable default settings and back them up with some data.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to help?",
