ProcInst encoding correctly should\nstill not allow xml targets, but the xml.Decoder should not parse the XML declaration\nheader as a ProcInst.\n\nMaybe a new XML declaration header token type is needed? I think all that is needs to\nchange is if the first token looks like a ProcInst with a target of xml return the new\nXML declaration type instead.\n\nI don't think the xml.Encoder should process the xml declaration at all though, because\nencoding/xml doesn't support non utf-8 encodings.  But it may be useful to accept the\nnew xml declaration token so that a user could set the standalone property. But i'm not\nfamiliar enough with the standalone property to have a good opinion on it.\n\nThoughts?\u003c/pre\u003e",
