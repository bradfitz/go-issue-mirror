It's assuming both that subsequent executions of *sql.DB.Exec() operate on the same connection, and that nobody else can operate on the same connection between the two invocations.  Both assumptions are wrong.\r\n\r\nThe answer here might just be that the code was relying on undefined behaviour before and just happened to not break pre-1.4.  But I'm personally not going to spend any more time on this issue until there's a reproducible, small test case.",
