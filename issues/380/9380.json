If you build using the above commit to go1.4 release, the first docker run will produce `FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: The database file is locked: database is locked`\r\nHere is the callgrind image of the graphdb callgraph:\r\n* in go1.4 (where db transaction is locked) http://imgur.com/AgtoGFg\r\n* in go1.3.3 (where db transaction is fine) http://imgur.com/SH9o6SK\r\n\r\nRelated issue https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/9615#issuecomment-67518612\r\npresently this is a blocker for docker to use go1.4",
