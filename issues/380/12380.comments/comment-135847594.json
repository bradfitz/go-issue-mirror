	"body": "@jbuberel Thanks for the followup, but how does that mean golang.org should not be available in my country? AFAIK that could only mean `go` itself, due to including standard librariy, shouldn't be downloadable from Iran. That doesn't have anything to do with the docs, and the packages hosted on golang.org, right?\r\n\r\nI'm aware of the fact that it's easier to block the whole website just to play it safe, but it'd be great if there was a way  to keep Go's ecosystem a \"free\" (as in freedom) one, without violating the law. Thus, I'd like to ask if it would be possible to have Google's Legal Team take a closer look at this.",
