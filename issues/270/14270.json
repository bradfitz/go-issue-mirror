	"body": "I'm redoing the package file format and code, and that work should fix this.\n\nNoticed while debugging a cmd/go issue:\n\n\t$ echo package p \u003ep.go\n\t$ echo 'import _ \"./q\"' \u003e\u003ep.go\n\t$ echo broken \u003eq.a\n\t$ go tool compile p.go\n\tp.go:2: import /tmp/q.a: not a package file\n\t$\n\t\nSo far so good. But take the \\n away from q.a:\n\n\t$ echo -n broken \u003eq.a\n\t$ go tool compile p.go\n\tcompile: reading input: EOF\n\t$ \n\nThat's not useful: it doesn't even say what file is broken.\n\nLike I said, the new package file code should fix this. This issue is a reminder to verify that. Please don't send CLs fixing the old code.",
