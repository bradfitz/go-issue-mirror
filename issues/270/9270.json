	"body": "It would be nice if the mobile docker image was pushed to the hub.docker.com so that people can easily do:\r\n```\r\ndocker run -v $GOPATH/src:/src mobile /bin/bash -c 'cd /src/your/project \u0026\u0026 ./make.bash'\r\n```\r\nwithout building the full docker image from source.\r\n\r\nThere is two options, either:\r\n\r\n  1. set automated build so that everything any change commited to a branch trigger a rebuild of the docker image and tag it\r\n    - Pros: it's convenient, you setup once and can forget about it\r\n    - Cons: It will only build a new image from sources and doesn't let you tag, promote or rollback individual images that you already tested.\r\n  2. manually push to the hub as part of the regular release process\r\n    - Pros: more control\r\n    - Cons: more work",
