But Windows path names contain an extra `:' right after the drive letter which\ncan cause problems when splitting the output into components.\n\nI included a patch which uses regex to find the right filename.\n\nTested on my Windows PC, I don't have access to *nix systems. Sorry for that.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5555/0/go-mode.diff\"\u003ego-mode.diff\u003c/a\u003e (1071 bytes)",
