If it was pre-Go 1 I would rewrite the spec to disallow\nthis, but the spec (\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/ref/spec#Composite_literals)\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/ref/spec#Composite_literals)\u003c/a\u003e says \"multiple\nelements with the same ... constant key value\", and struct literals like Key{1, 2} are\nnot constants in the spec sense of the word.\n\nSo I think this is probably unfortunate and working as intended.\n\nBut I'd like to see if Robert agrees.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
