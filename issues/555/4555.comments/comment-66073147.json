I wouldn't even call it unfortunate but simply working as intended.\n\nWe've been trying pretty hard to define what values are constants - and have constant\nexpressions truly evaluate at compile-time - and what values are not constants. If a\ncompiler had to raise a compile-time error for such maps, we'd open the door for all\nkinds of complications. I'd rather not do that.\n\nLeaving for rsc to close.\u003c/pre\u003e",
