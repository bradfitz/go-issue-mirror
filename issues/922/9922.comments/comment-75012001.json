I have a separate tool (github.com/rogpeppe/sortimports) that enforces that opinion. I don't think it matters at all whether other projects use that style, but it's useful for us to be consistent. If there was general agreement that that style was in fact a Good Thing, then perhaps it might be considered for inclusion in goimports, I guess.",
