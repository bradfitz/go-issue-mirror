But 'defer' is the keyword of the language and this is\ncalled one of the best features of Go. If I should always ask myself will\nit does work well before I using it, It is really not convenient for\ndevelopers.\n\nThe defer is designed to solved these situations:\na. let developers not forget to release resources they applied.\nb. such like in c:\n    pthread_mutex_t lock;\n    ...\n    void* function(void*) {\n        ...\n        pthread_mutex_lock(\u0026lock);\n        if (err1) {\n            pthread_mutex_unlock(\u0026lock);\n            return;\n        }\n        if (err2) {\n            pthread_mutex_unlock(\u0026lock);\n            return;\n        }\n        if ...\n        ...\n\n        pthread_mutex_unlock(\u0026lock);\n    }\nThere are too many place to add the same code with 'pthread_mutex_unlock',\nand it is easy to forget one of them. So defer can solve it. And my example\ncode is the same with this case.\n\nIf the defer can't release/free the resource as expected all the time, it\nwill be a hell to create bugs.\n\n\n2014-10-12 0:21 GMT+08:00 \u0026lt;go@googlecode.com\u0026gt;:\u003c/pre\u003e",
