This hides the functionality provided by the Format function to render milli, micro and nanoseconds.\r\n\r\nThis has led to some confusion that Format can't handle sub-second precision: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/TIinEnPu5wE\r\n\r\nOne option for a solution might just be to add '.000000000' to the reference time in the doc comment.",
