I assume this is therefore a RHEL 5 specific issue (I don't have a RHEL 5 machine on hand to try unfortunately). I'll investigate further tomorrow however RHEL 5 isn't supported by Go so I'm not sure we will be able to fix this (see https://golang.org/doc/install and http://dave.cheney.net/2013/06/18/how-to-install-go-1-1-on-centos-5).",
