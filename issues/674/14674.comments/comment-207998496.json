	"body": "The fact that Stmt is different from DB and Tx gives me pause. If we add an interface which is the intersection of DB and Tx, it seems to discourage use of prepared statements, if things in the ecosystem start requiring a `Querier` interface.\r\n\r\nIt almost makes me think the interface should be of `Stmt`'s signature instead, but then we'd need something like a `WithQuery(query string) QueryExecer` method on `DB` and `Tx` instead. (at which point the interface is named `QueryExecer` instead of `Querier` because `Exec` is also in the intersection of methods).\r\n\r\nAnybody want to try that route and send a CL?\r\n",
