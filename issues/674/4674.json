	"body": "by **patrick.allen.higgins**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003ehttp.Server only offers flavors of Serve() without a way to shut them down. Closing the\nlistener should make the server stop, but there seems to be a race in TLS servers where\nthis does not always work.\n\nFurther, in-progress requests cannot complete before exiting without some kind of\nwrapper for net.Listener and net.Conn which includes synchronization between\nListener.Accept() and Conn.Close().\n\nSee \u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/i4_kPK-rVxI/discussion\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/i4_kPK-rVxI/discussion\u003c/a\u003e for some\ndetails.\n\nA use-case for this is zero-downtime restarts: a master process opens a listener and\nthen spawns a slave, passing it the listener. When the master receives a SIGHUP, it\nspawns a new slave. When the slave starts servicing requests, it signals the master and\nthe master signals the old slave to shutdown. The old slave must shutdown gracefully to\nprevent service interruption.\u003c/pre\u003e",
