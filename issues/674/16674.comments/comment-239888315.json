There is a workaround (see above) for compiling to 32-bit from another version.\r\n\r\nI use binaries on this computer, thus building via `/go/bin/go.exe build`.  This works in all other circumstances (e.g. 1.6.3 windows 64-bit), except for 386 compilers somewhere after version 1.3~.  So, if `$GOROOT` value is the issue, it's only an issue for 386 versions after version 1.3~.\r\n\r\nPlease see above for `go env` output.",
