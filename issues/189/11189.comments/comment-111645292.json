Would you need to compute some hash of the block contents and then compare blocks with equal hashes?  Maybe, but it seems hard to guarantee that there aren't too many collisions.\r\n2) How do you decide what line number(s) the deduped block gets?  It might affect performance sampling stack traces, for example.  Maybe this isn't a terribly big deal, similar issues come up with inlining (which we already do).",
