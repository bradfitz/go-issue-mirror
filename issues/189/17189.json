	"body": "Here is a change to support updates to the Bidi algorithm in Unicode 8.0:\r\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/c/29630/\r\n\r\n@mpvl, I guess you are the right person to look at this?\r\n\r\nI am the author of [luabidi]. I initially referred the Go implementation along with the reference Java implementation to write a line by line port of the reference code to Lua. However, both the Go version and the Java reference version do not support the changes to the algorithm made in Unicode 8.0.\r\n\r\n[luabidi]:https://github.com/deepakjois/luabidi\r\n\r\nI looked at the changes in the C reference implementation, and then modified my Lua version, as well as the [Java reference version](https://github.com/deepakjois/BidiReferenceJava). Finally, I decided to port the implementation to Go as well, just to get some more confidence. These changes have been tested pretty thoroughly both in Lua and in the (updated) Java reference implementation.\r\n\r\nI had to make a minor change to the test file to get the tests to pass. But I believe, that change should have been there in the first place, if we go by the Java reference version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
