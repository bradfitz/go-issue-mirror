	"body": "by **dmitri.m**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\nThe Go time package expects the decimal mark in fractional seconds to always be a dot.\nAttempting to parse a time string that uses a decimal comma results in an error:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/d8qQasN0z1\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/d8qQasN0z1\u003c/a\u003e\n\nDecimal commas are standard in many locales, but there is currently no way to parse the\nfractional part of the second in a time string if it's separated by a comma.\n\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark#Countries_using_Arabic_numerals_with_decimal_comma\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark#Countries_using_Arabic_numerals_with_decimal_comma\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nIn case the provided layout also uses a decimal comma, the time string should be parsed\nwithout errors.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nparsing time \u0026quot;2013-08-19 22:56:01,234\u0026quot; as \u0026quot;2006-01-02 15:04:05,000\u0026quot;:\ncannot parse \u0026quot;234\u0026quot; as \u0026quot;,000\u0026quot;\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nOS X 10.8.4\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version devel +5037426bea2f Mon Aug 19 23:09:24 2013 +0400 darwin/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nNote that (*time.Time).Format() currently outputs decimal commas just fine since it\ndoesn't see them as a special character. But making the straightforward change to\nsupport decimal commas in Parse() - by adding them to the stdFracSecond{0,9} classes -\nbreaks this due to hardcoded '.' in formatNano().\u003c/pre\u003e",
