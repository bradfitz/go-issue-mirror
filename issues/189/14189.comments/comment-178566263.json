Interesting.\n\u003e\n\u003e Using GOGC=1600, I got the following:\n\u003e version points/sec response time\n\u003e Go 1.4.3 496,271 24.67ms\n\u003e Go 1.6rc1 452,760 17.08ms\n\u003e\n\u003e So, the response time for both came down, with a greater improvement on\n\u003e 1.6rc1. It's now in line with what I'd expect for the new GC, but we're\n\u003e still seeing better performance with 1.4.3 on overall throughput. Does the\n\u003e GOGC parameter behave the same way on 1.4.x as it does on later versions?\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/14189#issuecomment-178410866\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
