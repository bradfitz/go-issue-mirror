	"body": "There are other support processes on that instance (e.g. consul agent) but they have very low cpu utilization and memory usage. GOMAXPROCS was 4 for that service (in 1.5 builds we don't set it at all so it's left as the Go default)\r\n\r\nI saw the interrupt/spike in the gc times instrumentation we also capture. I don't know what that is for sure but it could have been a refresh of an in-memory data cache that we use as part of our bid prediction logic. I can re-run the test with those settings if you think it is worth it.\r\n\r\nWith the analysis you gave I agree that it's probably not the time spent in GC that is causing the latency. However there is lower latency when there are fewer GC cycles. Do you think it could be thread contention? Would repeating with different GOMAXPROCS give any insight?",
