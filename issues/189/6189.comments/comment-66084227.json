Proper locale treatment is coming (I hope soon) and this\nseems like the wrong place to start insinuating special locale handling\ninto the standard library. Strconv can't do it yet, for instance.\n\nI'll mark the bug as to be fixed for Go 1.3.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **go1.3**, removed **go1.2maybe**._",
