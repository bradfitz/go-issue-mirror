	"body": "Reported via email: LookupAddr(\"8.8.8.8\") returned \"google-public-dns-a.google.com.\" (with trailing dot) in all Go releases to date. In Go 1.5 candidate it returns \"google-public-dns.a.google.com\" (no trailing dot).\n\nThis was an intentional change, in CL 3420, but I believe it was a mistake. The argument made there was that the result was inconsistent depending on whether the C library resolver or the pure Go DNS resolver was being used. But Go 1.4 and earlier never used the C library resolver for this query. So the inconsistency indicated was only introduced after Go 1.4 and does not justify deviating from the Go 1.4 behavior.\n\nI am still investigating and will post more details when I'm done, but right now it looks like we should put the dot back for consistency with all previous Go releases.",
