From the\nsource code it seems that Go ignores this header setting by design, and uses `req.Host`.\nThis is surprising behavior and would continue to be surprising even if it was better\ndocumented.\n\nTo be clear: there are two separate hosts we are specifying. The first is the actual\nhost that the connection is being made to: \"127.0.0.1:9292\". (This is specified with the\nfull URL of the request.) The second is what we want this server to receive as the\n`Host` header value. Usually these values are the same, but there are use-cases when you\nwant to specify a custom `Host` header.\n\nIt's also surprising that changing `req.Host` actually does the trick. I would expect\nthat to change the actual host we're connecting to, not just the header value. So the\ncurrent behavior is backwards from my perspective.\u003c/pre\u003e",
