	"body": "Please ask on golang-nuts how to debug this problem.\r\nIt is normally a bug in the user code, for example, saving\r\nan integer in a pointer, esp. code that is using cgo.\r\n(one example that affects windows code particularly is that\r\nalthough HANDLE is a pointer type, windows actually stores\r\nintegers into it and if you store HANDLE on Go stack or\r\nheap, it will trigger this error.)\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to find the bug, you can temporarily\r\ndisable the invalid pointer check by setting GODEBUG=invalidptr=0,\r\nhowever, as documented in Go 1.4 release note\r\n(http://golang.org/doc/go1.4#runtime), we don't guarantee\r\nthat the invalid check can be disabled in future Go releases,\r\nso it is still recommended to fix such problems with Go 1.4.\r\n",
