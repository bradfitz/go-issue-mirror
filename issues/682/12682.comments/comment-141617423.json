Perhaps the write barrier thing isn't too big as we\ncan emulate it, but we cannot emulate stack map without also implement our\nown stack -- then much of the benefit of LLVM is gone.)\n\nIf bitcode is required, then iOS development might need to use an\nalternative toolchain (e.g. llgo), until we figure out a way to support a\nLLVM backend (probably won't happen because gc has always been using its\nown backend and it allows much faster evolution as we don't need to wait\nbefore required features are implemented in 3rdparty software)\n\nThe gc toolchain refers to the toolchain in this GitHub repository.\n",
