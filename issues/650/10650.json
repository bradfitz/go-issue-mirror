	"body": "Resolv.conf errors are ignored during parsing as they should be.  However, during recheck for file changes, any error occuring keeps the previous config.  This should be changed so that it parses anyways.  In cases where network is changed to say, setup a local resolver and remove resolv.conf, this change would never get picked up by a running program.\r\n\r\nFurther, changes detected in resolv.conf are never propagated up to main 'conf' for logic handling.",
