	"body": "@rsc: Two questions about your fix:\r\n\r\n1) Can we infer from your fix that unmarshaling a non-string value, even `null`, into a TextUnmarshaler is always an error? That is, `null` can't be unmarshaled into a *net.IP, even though both *net.IP and net.IP can be nil? \r\n\r\n2) The error now reads `cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type [...]` when trying to unmarshal `null`. Should `null` really be considered a string, or should an issue be filed for this?",
