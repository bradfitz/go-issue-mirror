This post is to state how I reproduce it.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nDebian Squeeze GNU/Linux 32bit.\n\nWhich revision are you using?\nSHA: 872404d61597 , Revision: 8040\n\n\nHow to reproduce.\n1. Start godoc: godoc -http=\":6060\"\n2. Go to pkg/reflect (it needs to be on a package page).\n3. Hold down F5 for 3 seconds (or whatever key you use to refresh page rapidly).\n\nAfter these steps the godoc process takes up 100% CPU and starts to increase in memory\nusage by 1mB every few seconds.\u003c/pre\u003e",
