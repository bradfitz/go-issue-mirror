	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCL 80160044 added code to mgc0.c's scanbitvector to crash the program if it sees a\npointer with a value in the range (0,4096) (non-inclusive). This helps detect incorrect\nliveness bitmaps that are causing the collector to look at uninitialized data. \n\nThe cost of the extra memory load required to obtain the pointer value may be too much\nto keep the check in the final Go 1.3 release. When the other optimization work is done,\nmeasure the impact of this load and decide.\n\nTo disable change if(precise) to if(0) in scanbitvector.\u003c/pre\u003e",
