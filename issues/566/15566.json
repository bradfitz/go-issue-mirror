	"body": "Problem: When I try to run a command in Go on Windows using exec.Command() and then exec.Run(), the arguments are escaped using this logic: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/syscall/exec_windows.go#L26. That logic escapes the quotes around TARGETDIR=\"%v\" which need to be there. I currently am assigning to Cmd.SysProcAttr manually to get around the escaping.\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\nGo 1.6.2\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nWindows 10 Pro x64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n* The code is available here, but needs to be run on Windows: https://play.golang.org/p/aU1PlbNTqM\r\n* Download any MSI. I used https://fastdl.mongodb.org/win32/mongodb-win32-x86_64-2008plus-ssl-3.2.6-signed.msi and renamed it to package.msi.\r\n* You can run Error() and NoError() to see the difference\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI expect to see the MSI say: Completed the ... Setup Wizard.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nI see the Windows Installer help Windows and when I click it, I get: exit status 1639 which is:\r\nERROR_INVALID_COMMAND_LINE 1639 Invalid command line argument. Consult the Windows Installer SDK for detailed command line help.\r\n",
