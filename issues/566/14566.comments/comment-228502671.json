	"body": "Since the linked specification doesn't state anywhere that the GOPATH is required, making the go tool handle this case, for instance with an option to specify the package path of the current working directory, is not going to be bug. My understanding is that this issue is then a feature request, and thus doesn't deserve to be closed because it's not a bug.\r\nIn fact, the linked specification states «This proposal allows the Go community to move from builds that require custom GOPATH configuration beforehand to builds that just work», and one concerned by this feature request can interpret this failure as a deviation from this specification, since any build made where no GOPATH exists will require a custom GOPATH as a consequence.",
