	"body": "Sorry, but this doesn't make sense to me. The vendoring feature is supposed to solve the problem of dependency management. I got all my dependencies except the go standard library as submodules of my project. Why am I forced to put this to a specific location in my filesystems? My GOPATH is set and the go tool searches for modules in there. When a project is located outside the GOPATH/src i would expect the go tool to search the vendor folder first and then the GOPATH for modules.",
