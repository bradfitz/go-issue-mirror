	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nubuntu 16.04 x86_64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nI want to build a go project using gitlab-ci. The project gets clone on the build machine in /build/project, which is not inside the go path. The build fails due to import errors.\r\nI reproduced this manually: moving a project outside the GOPATH leads to ignoring the vendor folder.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\ngo searching for imports in the vendor directory\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nThe vendor directory is ignored and go only searches in GOROOT and GOPATH\r\n\r\n",
