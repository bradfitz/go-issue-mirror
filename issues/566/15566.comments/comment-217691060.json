You can skip escaping them by manually assigning the Args to Cmd.SysProcAttr.CmdLine after prefixing with a space.\r\n\r\nI am bit concerned about adding a lot of confusing mambo jambo because of two programs (cmd.exe and msiexec.exe). For most users we don't even need to say word \"escape\", and everything works perfectly.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should specifically mention cmd.exe and msexec.exe as being different. And say that for some argument strings Cmd.Args will not work, and they should build command line by hand and pass it via  Cmd.SysProcAttr.CmdLine. What do you think?\r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be to create new function similar to syscall.EscapeArg, but specifically for cmd.exe. And ignore msexec.exe altogether.\r\n\r\nAlex",
