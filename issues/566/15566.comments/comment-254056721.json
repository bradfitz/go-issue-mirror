It should always open with Notepad.exe unless you changed the default association in the Default Programs app. This is different from Linux and OS X (where the file extension doesn't matter). I think we are safe to assume .cmd and .bat are always and the only batch files.\r\n\r\nAs for should we detect, we probably shouldn't because we probably can't come up with a list of all the exceptions. Leave that up to the user to use the correct function. I agree with @rasky that there should be a separate CmdCommand() function and documentation to point to it.\r\n",
