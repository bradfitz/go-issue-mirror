Since manually setting Cmd.SysProcAttr.CmdLine is an option, adding a comment about it would be helpful.\r\n\r\nAnd for a more official way, I like the idea of adding an alternative syscall.EscapeArg for cmd. We could then run (hopefully) msiexec and other applications by passing them to cmd like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmd /k \"msiexec /a C:\\package.msi TARGETDIR=^\"C:\\test folder^\"\"\r\n```",
