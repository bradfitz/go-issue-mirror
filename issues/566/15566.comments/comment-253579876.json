	"body": "I just sent CL 30947, which does the right quoting for cmd.exe at least. There is a test that now passes and did not before. The actual rules seem easy enough that we should provide them.\r\n\r\nThe hard question is how to know when to turn on the additional quoting. The CL looks for cmd or cmd.exe or %COMSPEC%, which is a bit of a hack. I would like to have something in the SysProcAttr that lets you opt in or out explicitly, but I would also like it if we could do the right thing by default in more cases than we do now. Is that possible?\r\n\r\nDetecting explicit cmd is easy, if a bit hacky, but then in #17149 we have an ordinary batch file being executed and that has the same issue. We could also apply the rules for programs ending in \".bat\". Is that enough? Do all batch files still end in \".bat\"?",
