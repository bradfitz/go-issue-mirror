And then: exit status 1603\r\n\r\nmsiexec is, probably, confused about having \" character in the file name. You confused it.\r\n\r\n\u003e I need quotes around the TARGETDIR value because there could be a space in the path.\r\n\r\nThe exec.Command passes arguments to the program as is. It will deal with spaces, quotes, double quotes and everything else. That is what syscall.EscapeArg does. You job is to provide all parameters exactly as your child process expects them. Leave all the quoting to do for syscall.EscapeArg.\r\n\r\n\u003e This is the command that ultimately I'm trying to run:\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e msiexec /a \"package.msi\" TARGETDIR=\"C:\\test folder\"\r\n\r\nLike I suggested above, you want:\r\n```\r\ncmd := exec.Command(\"msiexec\", \"/a\", \"package.msi\", `TARGETDIR=C:\\test folder`)\r\n```\r\nsyscall.EscapeArg will insert whatever escape characters to make sure that space in `TARGETDIR=C:\\test folder` does make it across to msexec.\r\n\r\nAlex",
