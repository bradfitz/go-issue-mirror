And if something does end in \".bat\" or \".cmd\" is it guaranteed to be a batch file\r\n\r\nI tried to see what cmd.exe does. I opened command prompt and renamed benchcmp.exe into benchcmp.bat, and run it:\r\n```\r\nC:\\tmp\u003e.\\benchcmp.exe\r\nusage: .\\benchcmp.exe old.txt new.txt\r\n\r\n  -best\r\n        compare best times from old and new\r\n  -changed\r\n        show only benchmarks that have changed\r\n  -mag\r\n        sort benchmarks by magnitude of change\r\n\r\nEach input file should be from:\r\n        go test -run=NONE -bench=. \u003e [old,new].txt\r\n\r\nBenchcmp compares old and new for each benchmark.\r\n\r\nIf -test.benchmem=true is added to the \"go test\" command\r\nbenchcmp will also compare memory allocations.\r\n\r\nC:\\tmp\u003erename benchcmp.exe benchcmp.bat\r\n\r\nC:\\tmp\u003e.\\benchcmp.bat\r\n\r\nC:\\tmp\u003eMZÉ$\r\n'MZÉ$' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\r\noperable program or batch file.\r\n\r\nC:\\tmp\u003eL$↑ëD$♀â°☻}ïT$¶ì∟┬ë∟$ëL$♦ΦΘ♣█☼à8☺╓Γ╝┴┬☼i╥ßà☼╟ï☺1┬i╥!╓Γ╝┴┬☼i╥ßà☼╟Θx   ë▌ìL\r\n)ⁿï‼1┬i╥!╓Γ╝┴┬☼i╥ßà☼╟ï☺1┬i╥!╓Γ╝┴┬☼i╥ßà☼╟ΘG   ï‼1┬i╥!╓Γ╝┴┬☼i╥ßà☼╟Θ/   ë▌ë╬╤Θ☺Θìl.\r\n ☼╢‼1┬☼╢☺┴1┬☼╢E¼$Çë¶$ΦÉ$╞D$♦ Φ2U♥8   â─(├Φ+5♥Φ╙\"☺\r\n'L$↑ëD$' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\r\noperable program or batch file.\r\n\r\nC:\\tmpQñ┼ïI↑ïæ╘☺ëiL☼╢i=☼╢s=     ⌡òêA=òïk►)ΦëD$►ï-8 Q♂Φr 1\u003ewu  | â└DëD$¶ëL$►â∙☺t8\r\nà╔u_☼╢T$$ä╥tJë♦$ëL$♦☼╢┌ë\\Φâ.♦\r\nQñ┼ïI↑ïæ╘☺ëiL☼╢i' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\r\noperable program or batch file.\r\n\r\nC:\\tmp\u003e\r\n```\r\nSo it looks like cmd.exe checks for .bat extension.\r\n\r\n\u003e at least to be reinvoked using cmd /c\r\n\r\nI do not think you need to prefix every batch file with cmd /c. I am pretty sure CreateProcess will do the right thing. In fact I tried running both benchcmp.exe and benchcmp.bat with exec.Command (which uses CreateProcess) and it executed properly (as exe) both times.\r\n\r\nWe can also do something similar to what debug/pe does to determine if executable file is executable.\r\n\r\nAlex",
