	"body": "I have a fix for this written, just need to fix a couple tests and will submit.  It's a rather large change because as I dug deeper there was more wrong/inconsistent.  To name a few things, three global dns related structs named 'cfg', 'conf', and 'confVal' which was fun keeping track of, having resolv.conf rechecks only in netgo, and double parsing resolv.conf.  I've removed conf and cfg, removed redundancies, and added rechecks for nsswitch and resolv.conf to the conf.go file.  Not sure if more bug reports need to be opened individually, but I'd rather fix it in one go than peacemeal.",
