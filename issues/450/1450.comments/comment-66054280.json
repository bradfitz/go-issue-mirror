It appears that 74.125.19.99 was previously an address for\nwww.google.com, and some tests have this IP hardcoded into them. For instance, there's\nsome code in ./src/pkg/net/timeout_test.go like this:\n\nfunc TestTimeoutTCP(t *testing.T) {\n    // 74.125.19.99 is www.google.com.\n    // could use dns, but dns depends on\n    // timeouts and this is the timeout test.\n    testTimeout(t, \"tcp\", \"74.125.224.49:80\", false)\n}   \n\nSee also ./src/pkg/net/dialgoogle_test.go. I wonder if a more \"permanent\" IP could be\nused for this purpose.\u003c/pre\u003e",
