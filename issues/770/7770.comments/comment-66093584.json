I ran the newest version of the code and am now getting this\nerror:\n\nread ../../../../../Desktop/test.cdr: invalid argument\n\nThe code is generating this error when it does the ioutil.ReadFile in the digester\nfunction.\nSo, slightly different issue, same symptom.\n\nPlease let me know if there's a work around, of if you feel this is a genuine bug, I'll\nfile a new issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
