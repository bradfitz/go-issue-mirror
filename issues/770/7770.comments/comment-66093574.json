What I'm trying to say, is that the attached code in bounded.go is\ndirectly taken from your tutorial here: \u003ca href=\"http://blog.golang.org/pipelines/bounded.go\"\u003ehttp://blog.golang.org/pipelines/bounded.go\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhile I realize that the example is more demonstrating concurrency, it's confusing that\nit doesn't actually work. I think it would be really beneficial for new comers (like\nme), if that example was fixed.\n\nThanks again!\u003c/pre\u003e",
