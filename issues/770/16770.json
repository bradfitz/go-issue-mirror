	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n`1.7`\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nMacOS Sierra/10.12, `amd64`.\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nAn Apple engineer [recommends](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/3727#issue-170086273) appending `-Wl,-no_weak_imports` to LDFLAGS where Xcode 8 is present to resolve issues such as [this](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/2674). Following that advice yields build failure for Go 1.7:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# crypto/x509\r\nld: weak import of symbol '_SecCertificateCopyNormalizedIssuerContent' not supported because of option: -no_weak_imports for architecture x86_64\r\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild logs are [here](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1d56218f057d73f0bc0ce22cf698a1f7). The build was performed inside Homebrew, but reproduces outside of Homebrew using the recommend LDFLAG as well, at least in my VM.",
