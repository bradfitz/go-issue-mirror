	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.6.2 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"darwin\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nset the db.maxOpen to limit connections count.\r\nand try to do db query when connection pool is out of  free connections\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nexpect database/sql support connection wait timeout setting, the connection wait timeout specifies how long an db request waits to obtain a connection if there are no longer any free connections in the pool. \r\nwith this setting, we can make the db request fail fast when out of  free connections\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\naccording the related code block https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/database/sql/sql.go#L800-L817, the db request will wait, until get an connection to return, when returned, the application may have been waiting for 10s, or longer 10min.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
