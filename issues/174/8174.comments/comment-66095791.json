This is the kind of thinking that leads to all these \"just so happens\nto work\" situations that plague Windows itself. Just search for compatibility on The Old\nNew Thing; the amount of work they have to do is incredible.\n\nThat being said, if wine wants to ensure total compatibility, they're going to need make\nthose very same concessions. From what I can gather, they /may/ fix it in the future if\nit affects more than a just handful of programs. (THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION TO KEEP THE\nBUG IN GO HOPING GO PROGRAMS WILL MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR MIND.)\n\nAs it stands, both Go and wine are buggy for different reasons and from different\nperspectives. Pointing fingers at each other does not make anything better for anyone.\n(And this assumes that wine even /wants/ 100% compatibility with 100% of Windows\nprograms!)\n\nSo I'm standing with Alex on this issue: Go has a bug, and it should be fixed. I can\nunderstand that it's too late now, but if Go's popularity is only going to grow, it will\nneed to be fixed eventually, even if no one using genuine Windows is ever going to see\nit.\u003c/pre\u003e",
