	"body": "@RLH Thank you for the explanation. My fault for not checking against the released 1.4. Now that I did it, I still see a 30% increase in GC time (1.3.3 vs 1.4), from 550ms to 750ms for 10 GCs, but I suppose I have to accept it and hope that the future GC is faster.\r\n\r\nJust one question (it is a bit off-topic with the original issue, I can ask it in golang-dev if you prefer). When in the document you talk about \"performance\" for the concurrent GC, what kind of performance should we expect? I understand that with a concurrent GC some performance metrics like latency will be improved but for non-interactive, CPU-intensive applications (number crunching), can we expect better runtime speed or the concurrent GC will degrade that?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
