(6c)\n\nOK, the documentation ( \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cmd/cgo/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cmd/cgo/\u003c/a\u003e ) says \"Cgo transforms the input file\ninto four output files: two Go source files, a C file for 6c (or 8c or 5c), and a C file\nfor gcc.\"\nSo I guess I still need a proper gcc after all.\nWill try installing mingw-64 and see what happens.\u003c/pre\u003e",
