I\ndon't think any of the analysis done in (*conv).Type(...) cares about the type pointed\nto, so we could just keep a queue of additional types that need resolving and any\npointer types that refer to them that would need updating.  And by making dwarf.PtrType\nnon-recursive, we shouldn't be able to go into any Type loops, since types can only\nrecurse a finite number of times without an indirection type.\u003c/pre\u003e",
