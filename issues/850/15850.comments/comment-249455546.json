If the attack has gained enough access to tamper /dev/urandom,\nI imagine he would rather do others much more useful tricks than to\ntamper with /dev/urandom.\n\nIs there any realistic attack scenarios that the attacker would just\nswap /dev/urandom? The only benefit of switching /dev/urandom is\nperhaps generating deterministic random numbers, but if the attacker\nhas root, then it's easier to just steal the private key, which leaves\nno trace and enables the attackers to do basically the same with\nmaking CSPRNG deterministic.\n\nIf it's the user that replaces /dev/urandom, then we shouldn't bother\neither because this is Unix, and the user with root is supposed to\nknow what they are doing.\n\nI don't think OpenSSL does this check (it did do fstat on the fd, but\nit's to avoid reading entropy multiple times from the same device.)\n",
