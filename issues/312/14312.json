	"body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this should go via the proposal process but I wonder if Go could support an additional format for date parsing. The one that I have in mind is: `12/13/2006` which would make it easier to understand for all of us non-US accustomed users of Go as we'd at least have a chance to know which is is the month and which is the day.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I should open this separately on the mailing list or similar.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
