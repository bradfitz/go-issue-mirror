So I have no idea what is going on.  Is it somehow picking up\na different _cgo_export.h?  Do you have a _cgo_export.h anywhere in your Go source tree?\n\nI guess for the next step please run \"go test -work -x\" and attach the output and also\nthe complete contents of the temporary directory that it creates.  Thanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
