	"body": "  Hi, all. There currently isn't code in the standard library to compare or sort version strings (arbitrary strings where sequences of digits should be compared/sorted numerically rather than lexically). I'd like to submit for consideration/inclusion this small package:\r\n\r\nhttps://godoc.org/github.com/Symantec/Dominator/lib/verstr\r\nhttps://github.com/Symantec/Dominator/tree/master/lib/verstr\r\n\r\nI'm open to reworking the API so that it can be included in the standard sort and/or strings packages",
