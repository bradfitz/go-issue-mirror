	"body": "\u003e \"It is actually a medium-term goal of mine to support third-party repositories, once I complete some redesign of our build system and redo its scheduler. I'm putting off builder work until after the Go freeze.\r\n\r\n\u003e \"The first trial customer will be grpc-go, which is hosted on Github. There are resource cost and isolation questions, so it'll likely be whitelist-only for a bit, and certain projects will probably only get spare resources which are otherwise idle.\" - @bradfitz https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/SVrNHQU1oEM/b13BeZHVBwAJ\r\n\r\nI would like to test one or more packages in the [fsnotify organization](https://github.com/fsnotify) across all the architectures that Go itself supports.",
