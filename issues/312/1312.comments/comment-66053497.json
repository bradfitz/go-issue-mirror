Casting it to *os.PathError\nseems like a kludge.\n\nSpecifically, I wrote code like this: \n\t\t\n  stat, err := os.Stat(thingToPath(thing))\n  if (err != nil \u0026\u0026 err.(*os.PathError)).Error == os.ENOENT) || (stat != nil \u0026\u0026 stat.Mtime_ns \u0026lt;= twoWeeksAgo) {\n    thingsToDo = append(thingsToDo, thing)\n  }\n\nThat's a whole lot of noise in the first half.\u003c/pre\u003e",
