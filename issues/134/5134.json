	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eAll values on a goroutine stack are considered potential garbage collection root.  This\npresents 2 significant opportunities for unwanted retention\n\n1) values that are not pointers can look like a pointer and retain garbage\n\n2) values that are pointers but are no longer live from the point of view of the program\ncan retain garbage\n\nTo resolve these issues the compiler needs to provide garbage collector with information\nto disambiguate pointers from integers and live pointers from dead pointers.\u003c/pre\u003e",
