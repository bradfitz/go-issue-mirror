	"body": "I think Request.Header[\"Host\"] should not be deleted when parsing the request. \r\n\r\nFor example, if I use the net/http to write a proxy server, listening on `127.0.0.1:8080`, and issue the following command:\r\n`curl --proxy \"127.0.0.1:8080\" -H \"Host: domain.com\" \"http://130.130.10.10/ping\"`\r\n\r\nThe proxy should deliver the `Host` header to origin server `130.130.10.10`, but it's already deleted by Request.ReadRequest() when reading request from client(https://golang.org/src/net/http/request.go?h=http#L714). In this case, if the origin server is configured as a nginx virtual server `server_name domain.com`, it will return 404 because of mismatching host name.\r\n",
