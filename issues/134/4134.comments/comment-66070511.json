And I discovered\nas much.\n\nGOBIN=%GOROOT%\\bin\n\n%GOROOT%\\bin is not a valid value for a directory full name on Windows, c:\\go\\bin is. It\nmust be full path (including drive letter at the start), but %GOROOT%\\bin is not.\n\nI suspect, you expect someone will expand %GOROOT% into C:\\Programs\\Go\\ (the value of\nyour GOROOT environment variable). But no one will do that.\n\nDo you expect go command to do that? But it does not. Nowhere in Go documentation does\nit says, that you can have things like %ALEX% inside your GOBIN environment variable,\nand %ALEX% will expand into something ...\n\nMaybe you expect Windows shell to do that? But, why should it? To Windows shell GOBIN is\njust an environment variable that can mean anything. My dog's name or something. Windows\nshell does not know or care what these pesky % symbols are. For all it knows, it just\nanother character like a or A.\n\n\u003e All this can - IMHO - simply be explained by the fact that my GOBIN contained a\nreference to another environment var (GOBIN=%GOROOT%\\bin, ...\n\nYou got there yourself. :-) But, do not call it \"reference to another environment\". No\none said it is, but you.\n\n\u003e I may seem somewhat unteachable, ...\n\nI think you are doing just fine. We are trying to make things as simple as possible. So\nalways start with the obvious solution.\n\nI think, I should close this issue. What do you say?\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
