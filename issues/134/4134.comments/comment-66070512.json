But what's also true, is that on Windows there are other\ncases of using %somestring% elements in environment variable values. Of course Windows\nitself knows how to handle those. But I'm sure a bunch of other programs do too. But\napparently not all of them, and neither does Go.\n\nBut never mind, I really can live with a wontfix for this, now that I know the cause,\nand how to avoid it. Thanks for helping out on this.\n\nJohan\u003c/pre\u003e",
