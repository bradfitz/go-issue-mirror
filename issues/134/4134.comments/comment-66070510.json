After that, I tried the go get again, and got a different (but\nalso wrong) result. All this can - IMHO - simply be explained by the fact that my GOBIN\ncontained a reference to another environment var (GOBIN=%GOROOT%\\bin, where\nGOROOT=C:\\Programs\\Go), and it looks like go get does not perform the substitution of\nthat embedded env var. This was confirmed by my third try, after changing the content of\nGOBIN again (into the absolute path: GOBIN=C:\\Programs\\Go\\bin, without any other\nembedded env var), after which the gotour.exe was correctly installed into the\nC:\\Programs\\Go\\bin folder.\n\nI may seem somewhat unteachable, but I'm really willing to be of help.\n\nJohan\u003c/pre\u003e",
