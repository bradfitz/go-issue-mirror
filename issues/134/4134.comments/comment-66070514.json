But what's also true, is that on Windows there are other cases of using\n%somestring% elements in environment variable values. ...\n\nI checked my 2 computers (used [set | find \"%\"] command) Win XP and Windows 7. No\nenvironment variables that have % symbol in its value. But, perhaps, some other people\ndo have these.\n\n\u003e ... Of course Windows itself knows how to handle those. ...\n\nYou are bit general here. What does \"Windows\" means in your statement. Feel free to\nprovide some references to that fact.\n\n\u003e ... But I'm sure a bunch of other programs do too. ...\n\nPerhaps. Perhaps not.\n\n\u003e ... But apparently not all of them, and neither does Go.\n\nCorrect. Go authors try to keep things simple. If you want to use value of GOROOT\nenvironment variable to build your GOBIN variable by using %GOROOT% in your batch file,\nthat is up to you. Go command does not need to know about Windows command language.\n\n\u003e ... now ... I know the cause, and how to avoid it. Thanks for helping out on this.\n\nYou are welcome.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
