You can see them when looking at the values for those env vars as they are\nregistered, using regedit or some 3th party tool. That's where I picked up that habit.\nBut it seems this is kind of reserved to the OS and some specialised tools. So I'd\nbetter avoid doing it myself.\n\nJohan\u003c/pre\u003e",
