	"body": "`http.Request` is used to represent the incoming request state for `net/cgi` and `net/fcgi`. `net/fcgi` uses `http.RequestFromMap` to construct the `Request` to pass to the handler. `RequestFromMap` does nothing with the REMOTE_USER parameter, which contains the authentication information from the web server. In the `net/cgi` case, that's fine because the user can just access the environment variable directly, but in `net/fcgi`, the underlying params map is not exposed to the user.\r\n\r\nEither the underlying params should be exposed somehow, or a RemoteUser needs to be added to the `Request` struct and filled in from params.\r\n\r\n/cc @bradfitz\r\n",
