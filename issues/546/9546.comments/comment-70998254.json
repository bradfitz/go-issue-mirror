	"body": "There are currently at least three or four open issues related to floating-point accuracy of various math functions (#8909 is the oldest one). Most of them are not 100% accurate. I think we should once and for all decide what we expect from the mathematical functions in the standard library: maximum accuracy (i.e. error \u003c 1ulp)? Maximum speed? A good compromise between accuracy and speed?  \r\n\r\nMaybe this should be discussed on golang-dev.\r\n",
