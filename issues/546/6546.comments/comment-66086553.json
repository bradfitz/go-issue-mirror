The behavior of\npanic(nil) inside testing does not make sense.\n\nI see zero value with having panic(nil) mark test as successful. If you really want to\nenable making tests successful, have a t.SucceedNow() function that would internally\nthrow \"type succeedNowPanic bool\", and parse that.\n\nI think it's obvious that:\n\n    if expected == actual {\n        panic(nil)\n    }\n\nis not readable, so I see no value with supporting that, and I think it's obvious that\nif someone panics with nil by mistake, he wants the tests to catch that.\n\nTherefor I see little value with \"testing\" regarding panic(nil) as \"SuccessNow()\". I\ndon't think the docs imply this behavior should be supported.\u003c/pre\u003e",
