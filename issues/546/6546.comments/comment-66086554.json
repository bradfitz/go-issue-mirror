Testing wraps (guessing) the\ntest in a defer statement like\n\n        if whatever := recover(); whatever != nil {\n                // handle test failed due to panic\n        }\n\nThe specification mandates that the \"handle ...\" part is not executed if the test\n\"returns\" by panic(nil).\n\nIOW, package testing does the right thing and an intentional use of panic(nil)\n(orthogonal to if in test or elsewhere) does also the right thing.\n\nPS: Readability is subjective, but IMHO, your example is clearly readable for a person\nknowing how the combo panic/recover is specified to work. And that it can make sense\neven in tests was discussed previously. Such use is correct (in accordance with the\nspecs) and is semantically valid (does what it's demanded to do).\u003c/pre\u003e",
