But my point is, the probability of error is smaller,\nbut the damage and frustration are big, so overall the benefit expectation from the\nchange is positive IMHO. (all this issue reminds me a bug in an embedded system I worked\non, where someone mistakenly written to 0x3, and the bug stayed undetected for years\nuntil I ported parts of code to run on a PC). It would definitely make the testing\npackage more in line with the principle of least surprise for a new user.\n\nIf my simple patch is indeed good, I think it has a good cost/benefit ratio.\n\n@Jan,\n\nRe, compatibility promise, I believe the behavior of the testing library when throwing\nnil interface is not specified anywhere, and I really doubt it that someone relies on\nthis behavior. If you know otherwise - do let us know.\u003c/pre\u003e",
