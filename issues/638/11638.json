	"body": "http://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.5\r\n\r\nCompiler and tools\r\n\r\nIndependent of but encouraged by the move to Go, the names of the tools have changed. The old names 6g, 8g and so on are gone; instead there is just one binary, accessible as go tool compile, that compiles Go source into binaries suitable for the architecture and operating system specified by $GOARCH and $GOOS. Similarly, there is now one linker (go tool link) and one assembler (go tool asm). The linker was translated automatically from the old C implementation, but the assembler is a new native Go implementation discussed in more detail below.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the drop of the names 6g, 8g, and so on, the output of the compiler and assembler are now given a plain .o suffix rather than .8, .6, etc.\r\n\r\n-\u003e I would find it useful if you can point out: does the compiler only target the native plattform, or will \"go tool compile\" target all plattforms go supports or ... ? As 3 commands gets replaced with one, it is not clear what that one command can exactly do.",
