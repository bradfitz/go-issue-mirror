Oops!\r\n\r\nIt's true that zero would be false for most cases, and should you want it zeroed you can always do it yourself after extending. However, should you want to zero it, you would only have to do anything if you weren't allocating. Which I suppose would be most of the time anyway, since at least in my case I re-use a lot of buffers. So I guess you're right, it would be exceptionally rare.\r\n\r\nLooks like I agree with you on all counts. Thank you.",
