Should we setup a soft float ARMv5 builder to avoid\nintroduce these\nkind of bugs latter? (I have a custom built qemu-system-arm without VFP support, but it\ntook 2 hours\nto run make.bash and 'go test -short std')\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._",
