What do you see instead?\n\nUnder 1sec generation time.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n\ndarwin, amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nb7663925130c+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nIt is suggested that Plan9's RSA generator should be \nthe underlying implementation. Supposedly it runs in 0.1sec\nfor the same task.\u003c/pre\u003e",
