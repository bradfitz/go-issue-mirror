I don't think he explicitly said to open an issue but that's what I've done in the past so I did and I like to have a place to ask questions.\r\n\r\nI submitted what I have so far.  It builds and all tests pass when running ./all.bash.  I can build hello.go using SSATEST=yes without error but it doesn't run! (nothing gets printed).\r\n\r\n @dr2chase \r\n\r\nI think there was a question at one time if it should be both ppc64le \u0026 ppc64 but ppc64le is more important so if that is done first, that is fine.  Unless the plan is to move all GOARCHes to SSA?\r\n\r\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/24453",
