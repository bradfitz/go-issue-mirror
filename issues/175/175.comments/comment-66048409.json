I expect //line FILE:LINENO to mean\nthat the next line should be treated as being line LINENO of file FILE, which is what\n#line means in C.  6g seems to have an off-by-one error.\n\npackage p\n//line bar.go:10\nvar x int = \"a\"\n\u003e 6g foo.go\nbar.go:9[/home/iant/foo.go:2]: cannot convert \"a\" to type int\nbar.go:9[/home/iant/foo.go:2]: cannot use \"a\" (type string) as type int in assignment\n\nI'm going to assume that that is a mistake.\u003c/pre\u003e",
