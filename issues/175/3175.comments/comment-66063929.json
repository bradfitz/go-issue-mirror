It moves all the network calls to\ninit time.  So the main part of the program is just doing gob over a Unix socket: the\nsender does a gob write, then ch \u0026lt;- 0, the receiver does \u0026lt;-ch, then does a gob\nread.  I don't know how it could be less concurrent.\n\nAnd yet it still crashes.  I am starting to wonder if this is gob's fault.
