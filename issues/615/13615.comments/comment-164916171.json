The address in the provided stack\ntrace is perfectly aligned, and the kernel complains\nthat the faulting address is 0, which doesn't make\nsense. Either the runtime systemstack mechanism\nis subtly wrong or something else is happening\nhere.\n\nIf you don't have gdb, at least run the program with\nGC disabled and see if that helps. (set GOGC=off)\n\nAlso note that the kernel version (2.6.33) is a little\nold. If the unlock of unlocked mutex panic happens\nvery frequently, it might well be a kernel futex bug.\n",
