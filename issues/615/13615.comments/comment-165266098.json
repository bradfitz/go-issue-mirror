	"body": "Testing with gdb apparently causes enough of a environment change such that the “unexpected signal” error does not occur easily or at all.  It is easy to reproduce the “unlock of unlocked lock” error, but gdb does not provide any additional debugging information about the failure (unless I am missing something).\r\n\r\nLooking into getting a more current version of embedded Linux to test if that might be the source of the problem.  However the platform has considerable code written and tested to 2.6.33 and upgrading may not be an option regardless.  Will advise shortly.\r\n",
