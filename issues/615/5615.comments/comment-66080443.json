The fix will require additional authority (ability to\nkill the process) for everyone who uses this api. So the api calls that use to work in\nthe past might fall after we change that. It is unfortunate.\n\nPerhaps we could change (*Process).signal to try and open process again with ... +\nPROCESS_TERMINATE attribute just for the syscall.TerminateProcess.\n\nLeaving for others to decide.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-windows**._",
