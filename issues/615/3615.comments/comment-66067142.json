I don't know that I'd want to change that.  If\nyou have an existing RPC system using lower case names, you must not\nbe using gob as the encoding, which means you've implemented a\nServerCodec.  My suggestion would be to rewrite the method names in\nthe ServerCodec.  When you read \"hello_world\" from the connection,\nsplit it on _, make the first letter of each piece upper case, and put\nthem back together.  Or just record \"X\"+name as the method.\n\nBeing able to implement your own Codecs is very powerful.  You should\nbe able to use that to adapt to just about any convention imposed by\nthe other side.\u003c/pre\u003e",
