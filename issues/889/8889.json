	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCurrently sync synchronization primitives are fully cooperative. That is, once\ncontention is discovered, the goroutine calls into scheduler. This is suboptimal as the\nresource can become free soon after.\nConsider adding limited active spinning on contention with scheduler hint. The scheduler\nhint can include:\n1. If GOMAXPROCS==1, don't spin (pointless)\n2. If local work queue is not empty, don't spin (at least we have local work, so cycles\nwon't be wasted)\nOtherwise spin for a bit, re-check resource and block if still busy.\u003c/pre\u003e",
