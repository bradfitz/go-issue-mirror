However, if you eliminate all NOPs before that information\nis actually used (e.g. CL 98810043), all.bash still passes.\n\nWe should add a functional test -- i.e. a legal Go program -- that fails if NOPs are not\ncorrectly inserted.\n\nI'm unsure how to go about constructing such a test. (Seems like it would likely involve\nCGo or reflect?) Tips/hints welcomed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
