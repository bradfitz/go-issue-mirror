I believe that our current 'DHGroup14SHA1' algorithm\ndiffers from the default DHGroup1SHA1 algorithm in prime number only - I read somewhere\nthat apart from that the two are identical.\n\nThe DHGroup14SHA1 prime is given in hex in \u003ca href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3526#page-3\"\u003ehttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3526#page-3\u003c/a\u003e\n(the 2048bit modp group) and is set in our code in go.crypto/ssh/common.go:\ninitDHGroup14()\n\nThe prime you need to use for DHGroup1SHA1 is the one given here:\n\u003ca href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2409\"\u003ehttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2409\u003c/a\u003e (second oakley group: 1024bit modp). \n\nMy efforts seemed to work but aren't anywhere near a patch. I think the refactoring\neffort requires more thought by someone who understands the ssh protocol and library\ninternals better.\u003c/pre\u003e",
