	"body": "The operating system no longer cries, as in Brad's earlier message, because we added a fixed limit on the number of threads in the program. Now the Go program crashes instead, which is better than taking down the OS.\r\n\r\nI agree with Bryan that we probably don't want to do more here. We chose to crash on thread count instead of trying to do some kind of thread limit exactly for concerns about deadlocks, and those concerns would exist for any kind of file system semaphore as well.\r\n\r\nUnless Brad objects, I think we should probably close this.",
