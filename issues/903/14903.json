	"body": "I propose we freeze old issues.\r\n\r\n@ianlancetaylor, @minux, @adg and I spend a lot of time telling people to file new issues or move to a forum instead of asking questions on years-old closed issues.\r\n\r\nI think what happens is people do a web search for some substring of a stack trace, find an old code.google.com or github issue tracker result, and then ask \"This happened to me too. What was the fix?\" But the bug they're replying to was Go 1.2 era and they're presumably using Go 1.5+, and the stack trace they posted isn't actually the same at all.\r\n\r\n@gopherbot could reply with text like:\r\n\r\n\u003e Auto-freezing close issue. The Go project does not reuse issues. To ask related questions, see https://golang.org/wiki/Questions or, if you've found a bug, please [file a new issue](https://golang.org/issues/new) and feel free to reference this one.\r\n\r\nAnd I think the API call from Gopherbot can even do that without sending out email.\r\n\r\nThe issue can still be commented on by project members, and project members can unfreeze it if needed.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n",
