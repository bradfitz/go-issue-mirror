	"body": "There is a problem with command line usability of `go`. From #12197:\r\n* [x] no long options like --help or --verbose\r\n* [ ] -h has a strict position, e.g. `go get something -h` doesn't work, only `go get -h something`\r\n* [x] `go get -h` help is unreadable - lacks visual structure\r\n\r\nThere are more features that could be added to stdlib.
