	"body": "I'm against this change. If you need to setup a context handler you can always have the default mux pass the request a global handler, setup the context, then pass it on to the actual mux. This also let's you specify a cancel context as well.\r\n\r\nHow the mentioned CL and example are used, it would just setup the context to be a bag of values. And the only values you could add to it would be static values; there would be no way to inject a \"current\" value.\r\n",
