A deferred anon function assigns to an enclosing local that is\nnever\nused within the deferred function, and is not a named return parameter?  This isn't\nnecessarily a bug, as it's very hard to prove that the store is dead.  Consider:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/5p_IUn56qA\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/5p_IUn56qA\u003c/a\u003e\n\ndefer/panic code is so rare (and so inherently complex) that I doubt it would be worth\nlooking for this pattern in vet.\u003c/pre\u003e",
