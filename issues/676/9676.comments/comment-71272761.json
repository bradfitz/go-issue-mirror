I note that syscall.Getenv isn't even documented.\r\n\r\nos.Getenv used to return two values, but we dropped that because we found that 99% of the time the second value was ignored.  I don't think we should change back.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should add a function to os that returns two values.  Or one that returns the environment in the form of a map.  Or perhaps it's not worth worrying about.",
