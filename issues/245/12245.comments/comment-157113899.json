	"body": "@sridharv Thanks for working on this, and sorry for not responding quickly.\r\n\r\nI am unfortunately lost where the discussion went; too many things are going on in this issue. Let's limit this issue to be what's mentioned in the title. Multiple package support.\r\n\r\nBy 'what's decided earlier on Aug 27', do you mean my posting on Aug 26? Then, yes, feel free to send a CL for that. I expect the first one should be just changing the current gomobile to support multiple packages. gobind already supports binding of multiple packages. The types should be limited to each package.\r\n\r\nFor supporting types from other packages, there is a separate issue (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12570) so update that one.\r\n\r\n@crawshaw is now changing the way to extract exported types, so please wait for us to finish https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/16913/  and sync.\r\n\r\nFor other stuff you mentioned in your proposals -\r\n\r\n1. Binding multiple libraries in the face of package conflicts: let's get back to this when we find the value of this approach compared to what you will implement for now.\r\n\r\n2. Sharing libraries with supporting Java or ObjC code: I don't think I fully understand this. But let's discuss this in the golang-nuts forum, not in this issue. (please cc @crawshaw and @hyangah) \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",
