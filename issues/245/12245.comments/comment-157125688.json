	"body": "@hyangah Thanks for the quick response! \r\n\r\nI'll split this into two CLs. One for what you decided on Aug 26 (it shows up as 27 in my timezone) and another for the external types portion. Given how I've implemented this change it might be worth it to wait for https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/16913/ for both changes, but I'll defer that decision to the review. Expect this in 2-3 days time (the week has started so I'm restricted to the evenings for this).\r\n\r\nFor the other stuff, I'll send an email to golang-nuts for (2) and we can revisit (1) later as you suggested.\r\n",
