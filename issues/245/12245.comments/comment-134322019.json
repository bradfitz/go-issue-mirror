	"body": "There are two distinct problems in the scope of this issue. Although they are relatively connected, we need to address them individually.\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n1. Name congestions among multiple packages.\r\n2. Being able to name Java packages, using custom prefixes for headers on iOS.\r\n\r\nThe solution to the first problem is relatively easy. If there are name congestions, reject to generate bindings or name the packages.\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\n     $ gomobile bind -target=android a/sensor b/sensor\r\n\r\nIt may generate two classes ASensor.java and BSensor.java. We can simply prefix the class name in the most minimal way it will be distinguishable from the other package. Given the fact that, Go import path is unique within the GOPATH, we will eventually find a unique name.\r\n\r\nIf the user is not happy with the auto-assigned names, they should be able to override the namespace themselves.\r\n\r\nI don't have a strong preference how we should represent the mapping but the information shouldn't be sitting in a separate file. Would you like to carry the discussion to golang-dev@ to ask feedback from a wider audience?",
