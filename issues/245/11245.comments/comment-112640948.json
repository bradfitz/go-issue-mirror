This leads to subtle bugs.\r\n\r\nThere are readability benefits to the status quo, also. It is clear that the Go expression `s[:i]` is creating a slice of `s` that is `i` bytes long. If `i` could be negative then the reader would need more context to understand the slice expression.\r\n\r\nThis is in keeping with Go's generalÂ philosophy of avoiding subtle syntactic tricks.",
