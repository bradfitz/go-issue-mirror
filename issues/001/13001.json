	"body": "While working on a way to address #101, it was discovered that some of the functions, constants, and structures offered in go/doc/comment.go are useful for parsing Go source code comments.\r\n\r\nIn particular, blocks(), block, op, opPara, opHead, and opPre.\r\n\r\nCurrently, consumers wanting to generate their own documentation or process Go source code are left with duplicating the existing logic found in go/doc/comment.go or adding special-case logic to that file itself for specific formats (undesirable).  I would like to suggest that the aforementioned items be made public, or moved to a more suitable package for re-use by others.\r\n\r\nDoing so would make it easier to add support for the generation of new documentation formats, such as manual pages, etc. and would likely provide a cleaner result.\r\n\r\nIf the desire is to keep these items where they are today, I would rename them as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n blocks -\u003e Blocks\r\n block -\u003e Block\r\n   block.op -\u003e block.Op\r\n   block.lines -\u003e block.Lines\r\n op -\u003e Op\r\n opPara -\u003e OpPara\r\n opHead -\u003e OpHead\r\n opPre -\u003e OpPre\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am open to counter-suggestions as to how this logic should be exposed and I am willing to perform the work requested.\r\n\r\nThis bug was filed at the request of @adg",
