It stops scanning at the first non-digit character, without returning an error.\r\n\r\nSetString does check for extra characters after a decimal number, so one could argue it should also check after parsing a rational number. That said, we are also in the unfortunate place where there might be someone relying on this behavior. I suspect the best we can do is to simply document that SetString ignores any characters after the fraction.\r\n\r\n/cc @griesemer",
