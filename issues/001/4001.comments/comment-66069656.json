No change: Continue to accept unknown zone names. Doing otherwise will likely break\nparsing of times found in email headers. The rationale behind accepting and returning a\ntime with partial information still applies. Expand the doc for Parse to point out this\ncase explicitly.\n\n2. Change: Accept January PDT in California and interpret it as PDT, not as an unknown\nzone, just as we accept February 30.\u003c/pre\u003e",
