If you change the program to use EST or choose a date when EDT is in effect\nyou'll find it works.\n\nI agree that the behavior isn't right. We may address this in go1.1 by returning an\nerror for an incorrect time zone, as you have here, or correcting by one hour if it's a\ndaylight savings time issue.\n\nUnderlying all that is the much bigger issue that you're assuming EDT is a known and\nunambiguous time zone. That's not always true. For instance, the string \"20110122EDT\"\n*is* valid in Sydney.\n\nHowever, it should behave better if the local time zone is spelled EST/EDT and that\nshould be fixable.\n\nTime zones are hard and also not always decidable.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **go1.1**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
