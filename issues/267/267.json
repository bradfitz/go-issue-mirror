Could you please\nedit the installation instructions so they're a bit more explicit? \n\nI could get through most of them, but then came the line: \n\u0026quot;$ sudo apt-get install bison gcc libc6-dev ed make\n(or the equivalent on your Linux distribution).\n\nI know what the first half of these commands are, but I wouldn't know what\nwas specifying the linux distro, so I wouldn't know what to change.  \n\nP.S.: I did notice that it's a bit more explicit for Ubuntu users (like me)\nsince I last checked, and I thank you for that. I'm almost there!\n\nThanks, I can't wait to try out Go!\u003c/pre\u003e",
