In C it sometimes is not.  In particular, it is\nnot on a 32-bit x86.  Therefore the first Go struct (the one with the [8]byte fields) is\nthe only correct translation of the C struct in some cases.  The second Go struct (with\nthe int64 fields) looks right but will do the wrong thing.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
