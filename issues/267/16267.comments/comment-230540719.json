This may leave many open connections when accessing many hosts. This behavior can be managed using Transport's CloseIdleConnections method and the MaxIdleConnsPerHost and DisableKeepAlives fields.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e Transports should be reused instead of created as needed. Transports are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.\r\n\r\nDon't create a Transport for every request.\r\n\r\n",
