This is especially relevant                                         \n                // if localhost resolves to [ipv6-localhost, ipv4-localhost].                                        \n                // Too much code assumes localhost == ipv4-localhost.                                                \n                addr = firstSupportedAddr(ipv4only, addrs)\n                if addr == nil {\n                        addr = firstSupportedAddr(anyaddr, addrs)\n                }\n        } else {\n                addr = firstSupportedAddr(filter, addrs)\n        }\n        return\n}\n\nTo be clear, in your case, is the problem that the listener is on [::1]:nnn and the Go\nnet package is dialing 127.0.0.1:nnn?\u003c/pre\u003e",
