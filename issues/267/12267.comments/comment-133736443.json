Two of them ends up ~reimplementing all of asn1 (without nicer tagging/unmarshaling support), and the other tries to convert BER to DER but does it wrong. Afaict they could use golang's asn1 if it supported indefinite-length encodings. The change to implement this is relatively small, and would help reduce the proliferation of buggy implementations.",
