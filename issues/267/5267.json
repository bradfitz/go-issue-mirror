	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIf a network name maps to multiple addresses (e.g. \u0026quot;localhost\u0026quot; often maps to\nboth \u0026quot;::1\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;127.0.0.1\u0026quot;), net.Dial does not try them all, but\nonly the first. This is a problem if a server is only listening on one of those\naddresses.\n\nArguably the server is behaving incorrectly, but most networking libraries behave\nreasonably here: they try them in sequence rather than just one.\n\nI have a test case that demonstrates this in \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/8644043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/8644043\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e",
