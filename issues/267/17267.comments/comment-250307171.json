	"body": "The official FreeBSD keeps the COMPAT_FREEBSD32 in their kernel config, but in HardenedBSD removed them by default. We can live with patched go14 in our ports tree, but when this change is in upstream, then it's even better.\r\n\r\nThe go1.4 have a special role in FreeBSD / HardenedBSD world, it is used as bootstrap compiler to compile newer GOs on these systems, and one the go1.4 isn't buildable, then we can't build the newest go anymore.\r\nThat's why I asking the MFC of the mentioned commit.\r\n\r\nThe issue what's the basis of the int 80h change is already fixed in all of the currently supported FreeBSD version, as you can see on the https://www.freebsd.org/security/security.html#sup page.",
