	"body": "I chatted with @rsc about this. The plan is to simply return small stacks to the stack cache *without* freeing their spans until the end of GC. That way small stacks can be reused, so a program rapidly creating and exiting goroutines won't chew through memory. This should be a fairly small change. For large stacks, for now, we'll simply delay freeing them and not attempt to reuse that memory during a GC cycle. We should be able to reuse the existing delay free mechanism to do this, so that should also be a low risk change. When 1.6 opens, we can reconsider whether and how we could reuse the memory of large stacks.",
