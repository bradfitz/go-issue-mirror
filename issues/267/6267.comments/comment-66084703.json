That reduces the attack vector from being able to subvert any cert\nvalidation to only being able to permit cert validation when it otherwise would be\nunable to be validated.\n\nBut you're right it needs some careful thought. Are we considering one package being\nable to attack another (e.g. a reflection attack)? I guess that's only relevant if\nplaces don't take a *tls.Config but only ever use the default, since you're still able\nto load arbitrary roots into a custom tls.Config.\u003c/pre\u003e",
