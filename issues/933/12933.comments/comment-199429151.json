(I did it on Travis but other CI systems may be affected and have similar solutions.)\r\n\r\n- You have to go to [go.googlesource.com](https://go.googlesource.com) and click \"Generate Password\"\r\n- On that page, you'll be given a bash script to makes a ~/.gitcookies file. Copy that into your repo *but do not commit it*.\r\n- Using the Travis client, encrypt the script file (instructions: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encrypting-files/)\r\n- The Travis client will give you a command to decrypt the file. Add that, plus a line to run the script, to your .travis.yml file ([for example](https://github.com/mholt/caddy/commit/27f9b58c5da9bf94e9731301cdef8df6141b3192))\r\n- Commit the *encrypted* script and updated manifest to your repo.\r\n\r\nThis makes your git clones authenticated so your rate limits are higher.\r\n\r\nEdit: Apparently on Travis, this doesn't work for pull requests :( So you have to surround the scripts with `if [ \"$TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST\" = \"false\" ]; then` and `; fi` and just hope you don't hit rate limits.",
