Since argv is hidden\nby Go runtime (see \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/src/pkg/runtime/runtime.c?h=argv#L172)\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/src/pkg/runtime/runtime.c?h=argv#L172)\u003c/a\u003e, it's not\npossible (at least, w/o hacks) to access it from the regular Go program. \n\nSo, hacks-free usage of VDSO is only possible with modified Go runtime. There's no risk\nin this, but since my goal was to run benchmarks and show the feasibility, I don't think\nit makes sense to do right now.\n\nIf Go team decided to support VDSO, I would be happy to create a CL for that.\u003c/pre\u003e",
