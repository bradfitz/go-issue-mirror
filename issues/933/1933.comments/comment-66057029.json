If not, what are they supposed to do?\n\nI've looked around for documentation but all I can\nfind is a few blog posts that just say how to extract a\ncopy of it.  I've seen the Linus pig email too but that\ndoesn't say how to use it either.  Is there something\nI should be looking at?\n\nThanks.\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
