The new Importer interface is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// An importer resolves import paths to Packages.\r\n// See go/importer for existing implementations.\r\ntype Importer interface {\r\n\t// Import returns the imported package for the given import\r\n\t// path, or an error if the package couldn't be imported.\r\n\t// Import is responsible for returning the same package for\r\n\t// matching import paths.\r\n\tImport(path string) (*Package, error)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwith no reference to the packages map anymore.\r\n\r\nWill not back-port to x/tools since the long-term plan is for clients to switch to the std repo go/types.",
