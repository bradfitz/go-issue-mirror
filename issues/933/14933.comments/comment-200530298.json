Their main purpose is to break circular dependencies, which is equally valid for 3rd party code as it is for the stdlib. Furthermore, a fair amount of people use them to write blackbox tests.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure there's an issue here. `-v` prints verbose information, and the \"package api_test, expected api\" is likely to be a semi-internal debug message related to the type checker. If it was an offence that the tool wanted to report to the user, it would do so without the `-v` flag, too.",
