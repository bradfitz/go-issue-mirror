If we don't draw the line somewhere then DetectContentType will be under constant churn and feature requests.\r\n\r\nPlease file a bug at https://github.com/whatwg/mimesniff/issues if you disagree with the spec. Once fixed upstream, we'll fix Go.\r\n\r\nUntil then, unless there's some place where we're in violation of the mimesniff spec, I'm going to close this bug.\r\n",
