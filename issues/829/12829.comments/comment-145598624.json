In fact, I'm actually a little tempted to delete all the plan9/amd64 code since it's been (way!) over four weeks (per golang.org/wiki/PortingPolicy) since we last saw a successful build result plan9/amd64. The porting policy requires we have a running builder.\r\n\r\nIf 9k is a buggy kernel, are there any other non-buggy amd64 kernels which can run in other environments at least? VMWare? AWS?\r\n",
