	"body": "It would be convenient for tools if the receiver of a named interface type had the named type, instead of a copy of the underlying type, which is unwieldy and loses information.   There's an existing TODO in `types.NewInterface` to this effect.\r\n\r\nThis feature could be supported in a backward-compatible way by adding a `SetReceiver(*types.TypeName)` method to `*types.Interface`.\r\n",
