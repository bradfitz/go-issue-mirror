	"body": "I've sunk a lot of time in to debugging Xadds in the runtime that unintentionally underflow and cause the unsigned number to wrap, leading to some (often subtle) horrible thing happening later. This debugging effort means the runtime is now sprinkled with underflow checks in many places where it calls Xadd.\r\n\r\nWe should consider making Xadd itself do this check, or introducing another variant that does. One caveat is that we currently don't have a signed version of Xadd, so there are places where we use it on a *uint32, but cast that unsigned value to a signed value everywhere we use it. In this case we definitely don't want to panic on unsigned underflow, so we should introduce a signed Xadd for these that takes a *int32 and doesn't do this check (though it could panic on signed wrap-around).\r\n\r\n/cc @michaelmatloob @rsc @dvyukov for any thoughts.",
