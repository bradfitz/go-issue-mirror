	"body": "regarding unicode.All, I agree it would be _logical_ to include it, but it is not _desirable_.\r\n\r\nThe All vars that are defined are for easy of use to users who want to select a default set of encodings to support without too much effort, more or less. It is often recommended, such as by WhatWG and W3C, to not support UTF-32. Including UTF-32 in unicode.All would make it too easy to pull it in.  I would pick pragmatic over logical here. The consequence of not including it in unicode.All is that people will often \"forget\" to pull in UTF-32, which I consider a good thing. It forces people to be explicit to support UTF-32.  So it is not a matter of maintenance, but setting up the right defaults.\r\n\r\nYou're right about UTF-16 being problematic in an analogous way.  But it is such a common format that it is more likely for bugs to be ironed out soon.\r\n\r\nAs for the disclaimer I would mention that the use of UTF-32 is extremely rare, a very inefficient encoding, and that its support is often discouraged and then quote/mention the recommendations of WhatWG/W3C, for example.\r\n\r\nAnother issue with putting in UTF-32 is that (as for now) the code will be unconditionally pulled in. I believe this is going to be fixed, but I don't really want to count on this.\r\n\r\nFinally, I consider UTF-32 to be more or less on the same level as BOCU-1 an SCSU. It would be too much to put all of these in the unicode package, give the wrong impression of their importance, and will make it harder to point potential caveats with their use.",
