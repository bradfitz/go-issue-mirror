If you have a real need for it, I'm not adverse to adding or supporting it, albeit a caveat:\r\nThe default should still be to not support UTF-32. So the BOM detection, using unicode.All, etc. etc. should not include UTF-32. It is therefore better to put the functionality in package unicode/utf32 with a big disclaimer. If one really must one could add a BOM detection algorithm variant that supports UTF-32 in this package.\r\n",
