Instead, they refer to them in macros.  But obviously Go doesn't have macros, and you can get already the information in a function by using runtime.Caller.  I don't think the concern about a hardcoded stack depth constant is valid, particularly if that depth is 1.  That is, the equivalent of a C trace #define that uses `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` is a Go function that uses runtime.Caller(1) to find out its caller's file and line.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to see a real example of how these would be used before we even consider adding them.",
