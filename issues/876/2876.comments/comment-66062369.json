Ideal constants\nare not IEEE floating point; they do not have\n+0 and -0, just 0.\n\n-float64(0) is a typed ideal constant 0, not\nthe IEEE754 value -0.\n\nOf course, if you make a float64 variable and\napply - to it, as you do with y, then you get\nthe IEEE754 behavior: you have left the ideal\nconstant space.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
