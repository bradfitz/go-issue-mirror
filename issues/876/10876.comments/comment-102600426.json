See https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt section 4.1\r\n\r\nIt says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the interest of robustness, servers SHOULD ignore any empty\r\n    line(s) received where a Request-Line is expected. In other words, if\r\n    the server is reading the protocol stream at the beginning of a\r\n    message and receives a CRLF first, it should ignore the CRLF.\r\n    \r\n    Certain buggy HTTP/1.0 client implementations generate extra CRLF's\r\n    after a POST request. To restate what is explicitly forbidden by the\r\n    BNF, an HTTP/1.1 client MUST NOT preface or follow a request with an\r\n    extra CRLF.\r\n\r\nThe Go http package _SHOULD_ ignore the CRLF, but does not. The Go implementation could be made more robust by ignoring those CRLF, but what it currently does is still correct.\r\n",
