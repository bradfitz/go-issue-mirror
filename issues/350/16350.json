	"body": "These internal helpers have signatures like:\r\n\r\n    func dtoi(s string, i0 int) ...\r\n    func xtoi(s string, i0 int) ...\r\n\r\nand they parse an integer value from `\u0026s[i0]`.  Especially since the majority of callers use `i0==0`, it seems like it would be simpler / more idiomatic to just have the caller pass `s[i0:]` as an argument.\r\n\r\nIn particular, dtoi theoretically supports parsing negative integers, except it looks for the `'-'` character at `s[0]`, not `s[i0]`.\r\n\r\n/cc @bradfitz @dpiddy ",
