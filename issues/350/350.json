	"body": "by **gorgonzola@online.de**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003ehello\n\ni want to prepare lists of data like mimetypes, color names, country names,\netc. to package them for general use. the problem is how? i am also not\nsure if the core team is already thinking about a global *strategy* for\ncore packages that will answer this case. in other words, do the go\ndevelopers care about how data packages are defined and integrated into the\ncore package tree, if at all? i for my part wish for a guideline because:\n\n* long lists of data should not be embedded into code but rather put\noutside into a text file or db.\n\n* this eases updating (via a tool, for example) but also the automated\ncreation of code\n\n* it also allows for the creation of different code for different purposes\n(consts vs. maps, for example), which implies that these types don't need\nto be always declared, wasting memory, if only, say, the consts are needed.\nit also allows for converting only portions like only specific color palettes.\n\n* to initialize maps at runtime one can easily parse a resource via given\ninterfaces. but for creating packages of consts there needs to be a script\nor tool to do the job at compile-time or earlier. shouldn't this be\nclarified to not let package maintainers develop several strategies\nindependently?\n\n* next is the format of such a resource. shall all resources be converted\nto json, for example? think of country lists but also of the gnu locale\nfiles, unicode tables, etc. or should these better be kept in original\nformat and made available via special implementations/parsers/db's?\n\n* etc?\n\nwhat do the core developers think about this problem. do you want\ndevelopers to follow a clear line or is this subject not of matter to you?\ndo you want data packages in the main tree at all?\n\ngorgonzola\u003c/pre\u003e",
