	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe fmt package and other packages that transitively use it (html/template and\ntext/template in particular) have surprising behavior when the \u0026quot;String()\nstring\u0026quot; method panics.\n\nI would expect the panic to continue to propagate back to the caller.  But it appears\nthat fmt.Sprint silently converts panics into strings of the form\n\u0026quot;%v(PANIC=%s)\u0026quot;.  This behavior is not documented in the fmt, html/template, or\ntext/template packages.\n\nThis leads to cases where non-trivial programs deadlock when one would otherwise expect\na crash with useful stack traces:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/G9ytQr6EPs\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/G9ytQr6EPs\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIdeally, the fmt package should not recover any panics at all.\n\nIf that's not feasible (e.g. for reasons of backward-compatibility), then at the very\nleast the behavior of packages that (transitively) use it should be documented.\u003c/pre\u003e",
