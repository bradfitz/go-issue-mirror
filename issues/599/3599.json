Consider\nit as a feature request.\n\nOn *nix we have unix sockets - a standard way of doing IPC (interprocess communication).\nOn windows we can use TCP sockets for doing the IPC, but a natural way of doing so\naccording to this page\n(\u003ca href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365574(v=vs.85).aspx)\"\u003ehttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365574(v=vs.85).aspx)\u003c/a\u003e is\nnamed pipes. Very close analogy to unix sockets. Providing the appropriate functions in\nthe syscall package as well as integrating them with \u0026quot;net\u0026quot; package sounds like\na good idea to me.\u003c/pre\u003e",
