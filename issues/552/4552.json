	"body": "by **emilliken**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhen an OpenSSH sshd_config contains:\nClientAliveInterval 60\nClientAliveCountMax 4\n\nIt will attempt to send one keepalive every 60 seconds and after 4 un-acked keepalives\nwill disconnect the client.\n\nA single keepalive from the server will kill the Go client's sessions with the error:\nwait: unexpected channel request: \u0026amp;{0 keepalive@openssh.com true []}\n\nI propose that instead of erroring out of the clients session on receiving an unknown\nchannel request, we check for wantreply, send back a channel failure, and continue\nlooping.  This would match the OpenSSH client behavior.\u003c/pre\u003e",
