As for why 6to4 source addresses must be de-preferred, this site has relevant data: http://www.fud.no/ipv6/\r\n\r\nBack before the first World IPv6 Day, lots of users had broken 6to4 connectivity and preferred IPv6, which resulted in long timeouts when connecting to dual-stack hostnames.  The problem largely disappeared in 2011, when the last of the major browsers fixed their address selection rules.\r\n\r\nSince the data is browser-based, we no longer know how bad the problem would be if those fixes were dropped.  It might be better, might be worse, but nobody is looking anymore.",
