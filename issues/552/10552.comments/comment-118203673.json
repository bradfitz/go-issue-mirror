	"body": "RFC 7526 does not imply that address selectors can delete their 6to4 rules; on the contrary, it means that de-preferring 6to4 is even *more* important, because wherever 6to4 has been deployed, it is now more likely to provide broken connectivity.  Since most other clients follow RFC 3484/6724, this brokenness will predominantly affect clients written in Go.\r\n\r\nRFC 7526 explicitly states:\r\n\u003e The default address selection rules specified in [RFC6724] are not modified.\r\n\u003e ...\r\n\u003e All hosts using 6to4 MUST support the IPv6-address-selection policy described in [RFC6724].\r\n\r\nCould you clarify how RFC 6724 might interfere with DNS recursion?",
