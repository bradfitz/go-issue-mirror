It appears we're allocating new spans when we should be reusing existing spans, since the live heap never exceeds 5MB (just checked the gctrace), but we have 100's of megabytes worth of spans. Another piece of this puzzle might be figuring out why the scavenger is releasing almost none of these spans back to the OS. This might mean that we're systematically cycling through all of the spans so no individual span has been idle for long enough to be scavenged.",
