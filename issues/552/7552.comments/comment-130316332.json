I'm surprised that errors are coming from tool/darwin_amd64/link.  That suggests that it hasn't even gotten to the GNU/Linux part of the build.  It may be an error selecting the linker, or it may be an error in rebuilding the tools.\r\n\r\nDo you by any chance have GOROOT set in the environment?  If you do, try removing it.",
