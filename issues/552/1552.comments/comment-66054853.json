I believe that it will work for both gccgo\nand 6g if we can just get the object file into the package file, like we used to with\nthe Makefile OFILES list.\n\nPerhaps .syso could be the extension for system object files that should be copied into\nthe package archive?\nIt is tempting (but unreasonable) to use .goo instead.\u003c/pre\u003e",
