To contribute code, please see golang.org/doc/contribute.html\r\n* It seems like a better fix might just be to store `c` in the scanner in case it is needed.\r\n* Are there any benchmarks that cover this code? What is the impact on them, running with `-benchmem`? You'll want to use [benchcmp](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/benchcmp) to compare them.",
