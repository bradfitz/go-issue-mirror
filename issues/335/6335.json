	"body": "by **Lytvynov.A.V**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eExamples in package sort look a bit more complicated than a person new to it needs.\nI'm referring specifically to sort.Interface example and SortKeys, SortMultiKeys\nexamples in the overview of the package.\nThese are great pieces of code and demonstrate language flexibility but they look rather\nintimidating at first.\n\nI propose replacing sort.Interface example (while still keeping the original one with a\ndifferent name) with something that clearly demonstrates usage of the interface, like: \n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/WRY2lXlsiW\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/WRY2lXlsiW\u003c/a\u003e\n\nAlso, this would be a better example to come first in the package overview, since\nSortKeys example is too huge to introduce user to the package.\u003c/pre\u003e",
