They are written by compiler when it compiles package.\n\nAs far as I remember, compiler rewrites all \\ into / because all our runtime procedures\nexpect / as path delimiter. I am not sure it is safe to change compiler to leave \\ alone.\n\nAlternatively, we could change runtime.Caller to rewrite all / into \\ if running on\nwindows. I am not sure what the implications are. It could also be misleading sometimes,\nif, for example, some packages where compiled on unix and then copied onto windows.\n/home/my/file.go would then become \\home\\my\\file.go.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
