I see\ntwo obvious options:\n1. Leave it as is and add a relevant comment to the func's spec;\n2. Force all path separators to be replaced with OS-specific ones indicating such\nbehavior in the func's spec as well. If source code is available, it's correct 'ab\nincunabulis'. If not - file was cross-compiled - you just need to do little extra work\nto get right paths.\nMaybe, it would be nice to have automatic src-detection in this context... don't know. \nIn either case, current version of function description lacks for clarifications.\u003c/pre\u003e",
