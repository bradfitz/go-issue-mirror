	"body": "by **jeff.allen**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. use net.Dial(\u0026quot;tcp\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;nella.org:80\u0026quot;)\n2. using wireshark, you can see the DNS lookup is only for A, not A and AAAA\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nThe input to firstSupportedAddr should be a list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, so that it\ncan pick the right one. \n\nThe input comes from LookupHost, who's documentation seems to imply it will look for A\nand AAAA records. But it doesn't. If the name is not found in /etc/hosts, then it does a\nDNS lookup using lookup(name, dnsTypeA).\n\nThe obvious fix is to add a second call to lookup() with dnsTypeAAAA (which doesn't even\nexist yet as a constant!), but that's not right, because it results in two requests to\nthe resolver. The right fix is that lookup() needs to type a variable number of query\ntypes and put them in the request. But them convertRR_A will probably get confused\nbecause the results will no longer be homogeneous.\n\nSo that's why this isn't just a quick fix. But it still needs to get done sometime. This\nis just a little reminder. :)\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n(any)\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\n(any)\n\nWhich revision are you using?
