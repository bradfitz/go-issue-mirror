(It's a slice of dir.)\n\nMy middle point above was due to my confusion about\nwhat to provide for srcRoot. For a dir of $GOPATH/src/foo/bar,\nI had been providing $GOPATH and getting back src/foo.\nProviding $GOPATH/src yields just foo, as documented.\nA sentence documenting the expected form of srcRoot would\nhave saved me a little time.\u003c/pre\u003e",
