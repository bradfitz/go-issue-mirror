For variables which are long-lived but unmodified across lots of basic blocks, we end up placing lots of FwdRef markers that are unnecessary.  We use http://pp.info.uni-karlsruhe.de/uploads/publikationen/braun13cc.pdf , and this seems a fairly fundamental limitation of that algorithm.\r\nWe could switch to another algorithm which might be better in these cases (but maybe slower otherwise?).  Or maybe there are ways to optimize this pattern using the current algorithm without generating so much garbage.",
