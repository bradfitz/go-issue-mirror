	"body": "The problem occurred because function tSpecialTagEnd made the assumption that a conversion to lowercase kept the size of the string unchanged, which is wrong. The original string was sliced based on an index calculated from the lowercase string, resulting in the error.\r\n\r\nNow, with CL https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/9502/ this code has been removed. By mere luck, it also fixed this problem. We killed multiple birds with the same stone.\r\n\r\nI have checked that the other calls to ToLower in the same package are safe.\r\nThis issue can be closed.\r\n",
