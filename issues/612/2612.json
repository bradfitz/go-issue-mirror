It will compile (and work as expected).\n\nThe problem does NOT occur, when:\n* the function is not exported\n* the parameter is not a struct (e.g. *C.int as a parameter type works just fine)\n\nThe problem does ALSO occur:\n* when the using a pointer to a C struct as a return type\n* when the parameter is just a C struct (i.e. NOT a pointer)\n\nI'm on Mac OS 10.7.2, using weekly-2011-12-22 darwin/amd64. Same error on tip.\u003c/pre\u003e",
