OS is Windows XP 32-bit\n\nOn Windows XP, the example program doesn't crash when I copied main.exe to C:\\temp\\ and\nran it from there.\n\nOn Windows 8 64-bit and Windows 7 64-bit, the same main.exe (32-bit) doesn't crash from\nmy network drive (coincidentally named U:) I ran it more than 20 times successfully from\nnetwork U: drive.\n\nHere are the 32-bit versions of go I tested (built with latest 32-bit TDM-GCC.)\ngo version devel +abe528ee4a57 Mon May 19 10:12:15 2014 -0700 windows/386\t\t\ngo version devel +4a839bf01b58 Tue May 20 15:52:08 2014 +1000 windows/386\n\nWindows versions tested:\nWindows 8 64-bit (native)\nWindows 7 64-bit (VMware Workstation)\nWindows XP 32-bit (VMware Workstation)\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have 32-bit Windows 7 handy for testing. It would be nice to know\nhow that flavor handles this program from a network drive.\u003c/pre\u003e",
