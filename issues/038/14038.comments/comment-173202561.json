If the Reset is concurrent with an active read on t.C, it is possible that stopTimer returns false but then the other goroutine's read on t.C takes the value before the \u003c-t.C line in Reset2, causing Reset2 to hang.\r\n\r\nI believe this issue is primarily a duplicate of #11513. Perhaps we should do a better job of explaining how to use Reset correctly, but I don't think it would help to add a Reset2.\r\n\r\n",
