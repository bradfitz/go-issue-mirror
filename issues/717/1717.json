	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe spec says\n\n---\nAppending to and copying slices\n\nTwo built-in functions assist in common slice operations.\n\nThe function append appends zero or more values x to a slice s and returns the resulting\nslice, with the same type as s. Each value must be assignable to the slice's element\ntype.\n\nappend(s S, x ...T) S  // S is assignable to []T\n---\n\nI think that the actual rule is // S's underlying type is []T.\n\nThese two comments may end up being semantically \nequivlent due to specialization of the definition of assignable\nas it relates to slices.  Even so, the new suggested comment\nseems much more direct and it avoids any possibility of \nreading the definition as saying that you get to pick T \nseparate from S.\u003c/pre\u003e",
