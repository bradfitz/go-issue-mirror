It crashes at\ndifferent part of my code (that are tested), always related to objects that I used in\nthe parallel part of the code. But it never crashes on Ubuntu or MacOSX, tried on four\ndifferent  computers and on Amazon cloud services.  \n\nThis is really strange and I am wondering if it might be related to Fedora. Any idea ?\u003c/pre\u003e",
