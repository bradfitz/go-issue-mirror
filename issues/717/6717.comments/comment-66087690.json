I say this because your build process looks quite convoluted.\n\nI am still quite sure that your problem is related to concurrent mutation of a slice\nthat is shared between several goroutines. I see the same object (the first parameter of\na function call in the stack trace) show up in many goroutines. From the copy of\ngeneration.go that you provided, there is no synchronisation so this is what leads me to\nbelieve you have a data race.\u003c/pre\u003e",
