I\nspent days on this a few years ago and got absolutely nowhere. I can't find any evidence\nthat loop alignment matters. It may be something else entirely, but in general modern\nCPUs are black boxes that can misbehave on a whim and - at least for people not privy to\nthe inner workings - simply cannot be fully understood. They are subtle and quick to\nanger.\n\nIf you want to try the loop alignment hypothesis, you could edit src/liblink/asm6.c.\nLook for LoopAlign (MaxLoopPad = 0 means alignment is turned off right now).\n\nI am removing the Release-Go1.5 tag. If someone wants to work on this, great, but I am\nnot going to promise to waste any more time on this. Long ago I made peace with the fact\nthat this kind of variation is something we just have to live with sometimes.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-none**, removed **release-go1.5**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
