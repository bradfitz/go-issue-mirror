[the first paper] show that just changing the size of environment variables can trigger performance degradation as high as 300%; we find that simply changing the link order of object files can cause performance to decrease by as much as 57%.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Research had a tool that would link a program multiple times, where each binary used a different (randomized) function order, then they'd run tests and pick the best function order. Unfortunately, my Google-fu is failing me and I cannot find a reference. (The closest I can find is VC's [/ORDER](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/00kh39zz.aspx) linker option, which looks like it could be used to implement this feature.) ",
