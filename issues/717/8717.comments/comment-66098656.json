We need to wait until Go becomes important enough so that\nprocessor manufacturers allocate engineers for optimization.\n\nI've tried to align back-branch targets and all branch targets at 16 bytes\n(\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/162890043)\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/162890043)\u003c/a\u003e with no success. Alignment of back-branch\ntargets increased binary size by 5.1%, all branches - 8.3%. So if we do it, we need\nsomething smarter, e.g. align only within real loops.\n\nI've checked that in both binaries stack segment address and fs register has equal\nvalues, so we can strike it out.\n\nSince code has moved, data segment also has a different address. So maybe it's related\nto data. But I don't see any functions in the profile that heavily access global data...\u003c/pre\u003e",
