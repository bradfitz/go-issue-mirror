This is very useful.\nI am in the middle of debugging something else right\nnow so I can't investigate directly, but here's what's\ngoing on in case someone has some insights.\n\nWe start out by reserving a big chunk of the address\nspace using mmap with prot == 0.  On amd64 that\nchunk is 16 GB.  But remember: no memory is being\nmapped, we are just reserving the right to map it later.\n\nThen we allocate memory for ourselves by mapping\npages from that arena sequentially as needed.\nIt is this later mapping that is failing, but those are\nsupposed to be quite small, certainly within the 3GB\nlimit that the first poster reported.  Any ideas?\n\nRunning strace on the binary should confirm my\ndescription.  Maybe I am using mmap wrong.\n\nThanks.\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
