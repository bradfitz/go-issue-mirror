It turns out our router was forwarding up to 4k DNS responses regardless of the state of the EDNS0 flag, and the Go DNS package was (correctly to the spec) choking on the larger than expected message. The ultimate fix was for the router itself, setting the window to back down to the RFC correct 512 byte size.\r\n\r\nAgain, this is not a bug with the Go implementation of DNS, but considering how broadly used EDNS0 is for avoiding a fallback to TCP for large DNS responses (which are more and more common), it might be worth implementing the EDNS0 DNS extension if only for that feature.",
