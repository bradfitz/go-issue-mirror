	"body": "As discussed [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/1117) it is possible for Java jar files (zip formatted archives) to include a prefixed bash script that allows them to act like fully executable applications. Many existing tools (`java -jar`, `unzip` etc) support zip files with additional prefixed bytes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately `go` currently doesn't support the reading of such archives which causes problems for [the Cloud Foundry cli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/411) tool.",
