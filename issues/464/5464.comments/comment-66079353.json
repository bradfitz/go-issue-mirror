Such\na language change would raise all kinds of pretty fundamental questions. The existing Go\nis not that kind of language and we are not going to go there anytime soon.\n\nYou can always provide a helper function that takes an integer string instead (depending\non how fast this needs to be be).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
