Consider:\n\n        var f []interface{}\n        var u []t\n        var i int\n        // ...\n        for i, f[i] = range u {}\n\nSo it might be worth of a thought to have it, maybe, specified this way.\n\nAnyway, IIUC the report then the behavior differs between gc and gccgo which is not\nacceptable, I believe.\u003c/pre\u003e",
