	"body": "The issue is that in the \"accept\" case, netFD.ctl represents listener's `/net/tcp/*/listen` file, while the \"hangup\" string should be written to connection's `/net/tcp/*/ctl` file.\r\n\r\nThe \"hangup\" string is not handled on the `listen` file. That's why you get the \"inappropriate use of fd\" error in this case.\r\n\r\nWriting the \"hangup\" string to the `ctl` string solves the issue here, but it wouldn't be a good idea to do it, since the connection would be closed before the client have received all the data.",
