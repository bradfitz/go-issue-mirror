The bad header field is just ignored and stripped.\r\n\r\nThat's not what it sounds like. I disagree it should be ignored and stripped. I think it should be an error, as it's not a valid HTTP header field. \r\n\r\nThe HTTP/2 spec references the HTTP/1 spec which says a header-field is a token and token is https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.6 which doesn't include spaces.\r\n",
