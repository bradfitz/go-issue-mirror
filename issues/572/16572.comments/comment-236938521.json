	"body": "\u003e I think that's kinda wrong. Misguided header fields can only exist on the Internet if too-forgiving implementations allow them to exist. And so far that's only been the case for often-ill-defined HTTP/1. With HTTP/2 we get a clean start with defined rules. I think we should follow the rules, and make it the job of the HTTP/1\u003c-\u003eHTTP/2 proxies to make the policies decisions on what to strip. But on the wire, HTTP/2 is clear about what is permitted.\r\n\r\nWell, probably I had few words ,but I totally agree with you.  And what nghttp2 does is what you described.  The bad header field is just ignored and stripped.",
