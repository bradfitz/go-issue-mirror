So, I think,\nignoring the signal is not acceptable. Perhaps we could intercept ctrl+c and send it to\nthe child process instead, and then wait for it to finish. Not sure about unix, but\nwindows version, probably, should start child process in a new process group, like we\nalready do in one of our tests in os/signal.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
