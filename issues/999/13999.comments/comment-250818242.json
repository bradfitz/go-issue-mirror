	"body": "It's not so much a lack of bandwidth (although that's always a problem), it's more that I don't like the idea of adding more to `encoding/asn1`. I consider `encoding/asn1` to be a mistake: there's far too much magic and it's too difficult to use, esp in the real world where things are rarely as simple as the ASN.1 might suggest.\r\n\r\nI subsequently wrote the [CBS/CBB code](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/master/include/openssl/bytestring.h) for BoringSSL and that has worked out well, and with a fraction of the code.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're committed to keeping `encoding/asn1`, I would rather add something like CBS/CBB and shift the rest of the stdlib over to it. (Although I've no idea what to call it or where to put it.) That would push some logic up, but it's sufficiently general that people could do whatever they needed with it.",
