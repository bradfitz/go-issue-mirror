This idea was tried a while back and rejected because it\nis too confusing: is f a function value of the value of evaluating f? Many ambiguities\nresult and the change, which was already in, was pulled. A syntax that resolves the\nambiguity would help; until then variables are needed: $v=f will, by definition, call f\nsince f is a pipeline.\n\nFor the back burner.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-someday**, **packagechange**, removed **priority-triage**._",
