	"body": "Currently on go1.4.2 windows/amd64, hybiFrameHeader uses int64 for the length of the packet. If a header size is greater than int64 the length will become negative. This causes the data in the packet to become the header of the next packet.\r\n\r\nPer the RFC specs the length should be uint64 or the websocket library should check for overflows.",
