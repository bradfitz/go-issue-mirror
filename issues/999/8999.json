Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat does 'go version' print?\ngo version go1.3.3 linux/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n1. Build any go program with ldflags -s option. Ex: go build -ldflags=\u0026quot;-s\u0026quot; foo\n-o foo.out\n2. Extract the strings from the resulting binary and check for the current username,\nbuild path etc. Ex: strings foo.out | grep \u0026lt;current_username\u0026gt;\n\nWhat happened?\n  - The debug symbols are still present in the output binary.\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n  - This information should have been stripped out from the output binary.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n  - This option used to work in go v1.1\u003c/pre\u003e",
