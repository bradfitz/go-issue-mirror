Only works for struct.field\r\n\r\nI'm cool with the mmap since /dev/zero mapped memory is copy on write via the linux kernel \u0026 we never write.  so, mmap'ing e.g. 2^N bytes N = #address bits is no problem. Do, let me know if you can think of a better solution.\r\n\r\nHey, and thanks for all the great compiler work...  been following along for a while on dev.ssa",
