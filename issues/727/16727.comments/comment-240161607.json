	"body": "I think this is a bug in your code.\r\nYou're casting (using unsafe) a pointer to an empty struct to a pointer to a large data structure.  This is the fundamental error.\r\n\r\nThe old legacy backend and the SSA backend differ in how they respond to this bad code.\r\nAs part of the expression `r.bars[0][0].Offset()`, you're getting a nil check on `p+65536`.  The old compiler did a nil check with a compare against 0, which passes.  The new compiler does a test load off of that pointer, which fails because it points to the middle of nowhere (way outside the bounds of the original `\u0026struct{}{}` you allocated).\r\n",
