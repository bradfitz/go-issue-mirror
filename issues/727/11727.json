	"body": "There are two ways to invoke `vet`:\r\n- `go vet`, which operates on packages but does not take options:\r\n  `usage: vet [-n] [-x] [packages]`\r\n\r\n- `go tool vet`, which takes options but operates on files or directories:\r\n```\r\n  Usage of vet:\r\n\tvet [flags] directory...\r\n\tvet [flags] files... # Must be a single package\r\n```\r\n\r\n[We](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) are currently using the extra shadowing checks, meaning we must use `go tool vet`, but because `go tool vet` operates on directories rather than packages, it can sometimes get confused by garbage in the `.git` directory (see hacks at the end of [this line](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/Makefile#L139)).\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have parity between `go vet` and `go tool vet` one way or the other: either `go tool vet` should be able to operate on packages, or `go vet` should accept options. Perhaps `go tool vet` should be a superset of `go vet`.",
