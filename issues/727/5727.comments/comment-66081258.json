First you need to get the go.tools repo because godoc has been moved into there.\nThen, search for \"info.IsMain = \" in go.tools/godoc/server.go. Change that line to:\n\ninfo.IsMain = false \u0026\u0026 pkgname == \"main\"\n\nto change it permanently (or add a flag like the CL above if you really need it). Now to\nbuild the binary you can cd into go.tools/cmd/godoc and do 'go install' or 'go build -o\ngodoc' or something like that.\n\nHaven't tested it extensively yet but it seems to be working.\u003c/pre\u003e",
