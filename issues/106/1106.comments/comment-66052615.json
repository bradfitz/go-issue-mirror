So maybe we can\nclose this issue. The only problem I still have the test TestCtrlBreak does not run by\ndefault. I could not enable it to run always because it sends CtrlBreak to a \"process\ngroup\", whatever that means. It was killing cmd.exe running the test (since cmd.exe does\nnot have CtrlBreak handler). I was concerned about windows gobuilders.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
