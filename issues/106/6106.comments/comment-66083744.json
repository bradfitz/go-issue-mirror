There\nmay be some things we can do to improve interface comparisons in some specific scenarios:\n- for pointer types when the types are equal. For example, comparing reflect.Type falls\ninto this category, and the comparison is that both are *rtype and both pointers are\nequal.\n- base types which are numbers or booleans.\n\nWe could do a fast path for these common and seemingly trivial interface comparisons, to\nimprove their performance to something less than the 20X.\n\nCurrently, the 20X for equality check vs non-interface equality of same underlying value\nseems excessive.\n\nDisclaimer: I looked through the runtime.ifaceeq and runtime.efaceeq but couldn't figure\nit out.\u003c/pre\u003e",
