What happens is that the\nparse of the function call for the go statement returns a function literal instead of a\ncall, which then causes the spurious first error message (first only because the\nmessages are sorted by position). The parser should either synchronize better when\nencountering the flawed defer; and/or return a BadExpr for the function call which could\nbe used as a signal to not issue another error.\u003c/pre\u003e",
