	"body": "In the best case, the output of `go test github.com/blevesearch/bleve/...` is 88 lines long. If one of the early test fails, the error message can easily be scrolled out and short of looking at `$?` or scrolling back manually, the user has no way to know the test run failed.\r\n\r\nI propose `go test ` prints something visible at the end of the run in that case like:\r\n```\r\nTEST RESULT: FAILED\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving a prefix like `TEST RESULT:` may make it easier for tools processing test output to ignore this line in the future, should its format change (by adding the number of tests run/successful, or time it took, etc.).\r\nA `TEST RESULT: OK` might be displayed on success to.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
