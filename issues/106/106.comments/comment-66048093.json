The\ndocumentation clearly states that when you compile go, you need to state the operating\nsystem and architecture on which you're going to run your executables: \"Note that\n$GOARCH and $GOOS identify the target environment, not the environment you are running\non. In effect, you are always cross-compiling.\" (\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/install.html)\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/install.html)\u003c/a\u003e. \nIf the go build process was only capable of building for the running environment, there\nwould be no need to specify GOOS or GOARCH.\n\nClearly the intent that the.wabbott expressed was to run gcc on an i686 processor,\nproducing 6* executables to run on an amd64 machine.  That seems to not be what he\nwanted to do, but still, according to the documentation, it should have worked.\u003c/pre\u003e",
