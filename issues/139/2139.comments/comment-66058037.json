If you want to report the problem\nwith dumpbin, you should speak to Microsoft instead.\n\nIf you have any idea why dumpbin crashing, please let us know, because I don't know. I\nreally don't follow your reference on pe documents. 8l does produce /\u0026lt;num\u0026gt; section\nnames, but they are valid according to the document extracts you have provided. I would\nbe happy to adjust our exe format as required, but I don't know how.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
