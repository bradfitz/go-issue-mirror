Long names in object files are truncated if they are emitted to an\nexecutable file. ***\n\nI think what he is saying is that you can have section with /\u0026lt;num\u0026gt; names in your\ncompiled object file, but not in executable. Once you copy section into your final\nexecutable, then it has to be truncated somehow to 8 characters.\n\nThese sections (with /\u0026lt;num\u0026gt; names) were introduced to store dwarf info. That is\nwhat all mingw gcc generated files do. That is how gdb finds that information. So I'm\nnot sure what is the way out. Perhaps, someone with knowledge of gdb can suggest an\nalternative ways.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
