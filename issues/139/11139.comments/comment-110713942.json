I'll stop using `%v` from now on then.\r\n\r\nThe issue I mentioned is serious: it cost me a lot of time debugging due to my (sensible) assumption that a value was not `nil` when in fact it was. If `%v` cannot be changed, I would suggest that the documentation mark `%v` as deprecated and encourage the use of `%#v`.",
