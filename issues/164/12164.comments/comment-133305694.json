Of course, for \"* p = 0\" this would still fail, but people tend to write \"\\*p\" rather than \"\\* p\".\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\n\u003e Another option might be to simply remove the \"Line of stars\" logic.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that too, and if possible, I think it's a better solution because it's a chance to make Go a little simpler. I've seen a lot of Go code, and line of stars is exceedingly rare. It seems it'd be better not to have it.\r\n\r\n\u003e Not urgent.\r\n\r\nAgreed. I filed this simply to track the issue, since I had encountered it just recently.",
