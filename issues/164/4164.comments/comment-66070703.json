No conflict and no need for a new\nkeyword.\n* map\u003ckey,value\u003e is the Java syntax, you said it was old and ugly\n* Go has no classes\n* Java classes are as verbose as Go structs: class T { int a, b; } versus type T struct\n{ a, b int }\n* Go is a lot less messy than C\n* Java's one-class-per-file often results in illogical organization.\n* Go is not limited to a small number of people, it is already popular.\n* Go is not a product.\n* Many Go users including me like the syntax very much\n* Go 1 syntax is frozen.\n* don't be aggressive on a issue tracker, instead of being aggressive and apologizing at\nthe same time.\u003c/pre\u003e",
