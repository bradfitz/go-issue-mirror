	"body": "by **Alexander.Luya**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eGolang gets rid of some bad things in java,but kept some ugly things in \u0026quot;old\u0026quot;\nlanguages that java have gotten rid of long,long ago,for example,\u0026quot;for\nrange\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;interface{}\u0026quot;,and map definition syntax are ugly and\nstupid(sorry),why not just using:for(item:collection),interf(then it will not conflict\nwith key word:interface),and map\u0026lt;key,value\u0026gt;.\n    And golang's class definition is very verbose and ugly also.I am not sure whether other language's are better than java,but I am sure Java's class related syntax is far more beautiful and concise than golang,enforing \none class per file is not so bad,saving a lot of typing,make source directory more\nreadable.Please do not inherit c's inhabitation to mix all stuff one a file,it is\nmessing. \n    Haven't you guys never checked existing \u0026quot;products\u0026quot;,when you prepare to create a new one.And If you guys want to keep galang in a small developers forever,it is ok,I can just say google is rich....But if you want to make it popular and let more people benifit from your work.Please do consider to get rid of that ugly,verbose and stupid syntaxs.\n    I think this syntax chanaging will not hurt deep thing of golang,and relative easy to change.Take a poll,somebody will get aganist it,but more people will welcome it.After all,sciense is not politcal,the better can  defeat the bad more easily.\n    In the end,don't be borned as old man,born as Benjamin Button.Don't hesitate until is too late to change.\n    Forgive my agreesive.\u003c/pre\u003e",
