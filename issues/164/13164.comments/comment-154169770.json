That said, we don't only see this in testing, we also see it on our production systems.\r\n\r\nIts a c++ application doing daemonizing double fork where the grandparent doesn't exit until the grandchild sends a signal to the grandparent indicating that it's ready to do work.\r\n\r\nWe've tested that we can fix the problem by adding code to our c++ application to unblock signals before doing anything else, but this is not a whole solution for us because the c++ application is already widely distributed.\r\n",
