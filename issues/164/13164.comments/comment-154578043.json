When creating a new thread it is necessary to temporarily block all signals, so that the new thread does not receive a signal before it has registered an alternate signal stack.  However, the code uses pthread_sigmask, which only affects the signal mask for the calling thread.  My assumption is that execve uses the signal mask of the thread that calls execve, or the process-wide signal mask.  Anyhow, that is probably not the issue.\r\n\r\nDoes your program use the os/signal package at all?",
