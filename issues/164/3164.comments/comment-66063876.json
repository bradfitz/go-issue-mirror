Still taking the idea from Closure Templates, simplifying it a bit:\n\n- Parsing process must accept a configuration/flag to turn on compact mode. Off by\ndefault, so nothing that exists change. I'm not sure where this flag is set.\n- When the flag is on, lines are joined using same Closure heuristics: \"if the join\nlocation borders a template or HTML tag on either side, the lines are joined with no\nspace. If the join location does not border a template or HTML tag on either side, the\nlines are joined with exactly one space\".\n- A special action {{sp}} inserts an space for two lines that would otherwise be joined\nwithout any space.\n- No need for the {{nil}} tag used in Closure; simply merge lines with the desired\nspaces if that is needed.\n\nInline JavaScript may require some more thoughts.\u003c/pre\u003e",
