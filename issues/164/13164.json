	"body": "I can recreate this by running a test of our application in a loop. Eventually a process is started that has many of its signals blocked. This ends up causing a error because we're running a process that expects to be able to receive signals.\r\n\r\nMy attempts to create a smaller program that reproduces this has only failed. I would assume that some bit of the complexity of the application is triggering the bug.\r\n\r\nI'll be happy to provide any information that I can.\r\n\r\nGabriel Russell",
