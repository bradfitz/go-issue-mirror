I don't see anything in our code for startup (except plan9), but maybe the default is OK.  For returns from cgo calls I think we can rely on the calling convention which states that fp rounding mode is callee-save.  But for callbacks from C-\u003eGo I don't see where we do anything, and I think we should save+set and restore the fp mode (on x86 at least).",
