Now any relevant hardware supports IEEE floats, so perhaps\n\u003e it's ok to request it (we already refer to the standard in the spec. But I\n\u003e doubt it makes a difference in practice, so why risk it?\n\u003e\nMaking it clear one way or another if changing the rounding mode is\nsupported would make it clear whether or not the compiler can constant fold\nfp math. Mandating that the fp environment is a constant thing is a bit\ndifferent from mandating exactly what that fp environment is.\n",
