	"body": "by **kenliz@cruzio.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIt appears that the defer un(trace(\u0026quot;myFunc\u0026quot;)) style of tracing does not work\nwith go routines. \nMore generally, it looks like when functions are executed as go routines, there is no\nguarantee \nthat deferred functions will be executed.\n \nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Build the two attached programs and run them.\n2. Look at the output produced. (the .txt files attached)\n3. All the \u0026quot;leaving\u0026quot; messages are missing.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nBoth programs should produce the same output, but in different orders, and with\ndifferent time \nstamps. But the program that uses go routines is missing the some of the deferred\noutput. All \nthe deferred statements did not get executed.\n\nBoth programs call a subroutine which uses\n    defer un(trace(\u0026quot;here\u0026quot;));\nstatements to trace entering and leaving the subroutine.\n\nIn the first program, the subroutines are called directly by main() and the output is\nnormal.\n\nIn the second program, the subroutines are called with code based on the server example\nin \ndoc/progs/server1.go file.\n\nYou can use diff to compare the two files and see how similar they are except for the\naddition \nof go routine logic.\n\nIt appears that the use of go routines and defer statements do not interact correctly.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\ndarwin amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nd9cbc65f0f9e tip\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI'm looking into another problem, which is corrupted output from go routines writing to\nthe \nsame writer. In this problem, memory seems to move, and the output is corrupted.\n\nSo I started adding time stamps and tracing, and noticed this simpler problem.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/413/0/Print_Bug.go\"\u003ePrint_Bug.go\u003c/a\u003e (1134 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/413/0/Print_Bug_Chan.go\"\u003ePrint_Bug_Chan.go\u003c/a\u003e (2298 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/413/0/Print_Bug.txt\"\u003ePrint_Bug.txt\u003c/a\u003e (2278 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/413/0/Print_Bug_Chan.txt\"\u003ePrint_Bug_Chan.txt\u003c/a\u003e (1883 bytes)",
