But why don't provide a ARM64 binary release?\r\n\r\nHonestly, if I'd like to use Go 1.5, I don't like to install gcc and some old weird tools first, then compiling Go 1.4 and finally get to a Go 1.5 runtime. Then I only have it built by myself, and have to run all the tests to get sure, that everything is fine.\r\nThat's a cumbersome and maybe erroneous process, which doesn't help to reach my goal: \"I want to use Go 1.5!\". \r\n\r\nWith a pre-build and fully tested tarball of a Go 1.5 runtime, we just have to install and use it. And we could be sure, it's completely tested as well. I think you can agree too.",
