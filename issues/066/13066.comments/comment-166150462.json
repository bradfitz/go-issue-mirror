I'm already in direct\n\u003e contact with ARM and with some of the new server/cpu manufacturers for\n\u003e ARM64 and hoping to find some possible solution - can't promise anything\n\u003e right now, but I'll try my best.\n\u003e\n\u003e I'm pretty sure that there is no public arm64 cloud yet. If you find one,\nlet me know :-)\n\n\u003e My goal would be, to get official ARM64 binary builds too.\n\u003e\nWhy, particularly? Most arm64 machines are much more powerful than the\nraspberry pi and building Go yourself on them fairly painless. Even my\ndragonboard 410c manages it, and I think that's the lowest spec board you\ncan buy :-)\n\n\u003e How much build servers or instances would we need? Preferable as a cloud\n\u003e service or is it possible to use on-premise too, with a high-speed internet\n\u003e access of course?\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/13066#issuecomment-165761164\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
