It cannot\nreasonably be expected that the result of the Log... functions is bit exact for all\ninput values (unless the math library would use a higher precision internally, which it\ndoesn't).  The test for equality in the alike() function is too strict.  Assuming thet\nlibrary code has been handmade to be bit exact given specific compiler, platform and\ntest cases it's not surprising that it fails with other platforms or compiler, e.g.\ndepending on optimisation choices.\u003c/pre\u003e",
