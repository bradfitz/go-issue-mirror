	"body": "OK, so I have a patch with the changes and a full integration test which is an addition to the existing tests. This involved adding a new option to `generate_cert.go` to create a cert which contains `x509.ExtKeyUsageClientAuth` and replacing the test certificates in `handshake_server_test.go` since the new test needs to verify the client certificate and the old test certificates do not support that. Since I'm not a crypto expert a review would be nice :)\r\n\r\nThe tests check three cases:\r\n\r\n* Only `ClientCAs`\r\n* Only `GetClientCAs()`\r\n* Prefer `GetClientCAs()` over `ClientCAs`\r\n\r\nI've generated the updated `testdata/*` files with the homebrew version `OpenSSL 1.0.2h  3 May 2016` of `openssl` on OSX but I don't imagine that this is the reference implementation that the crytpo/tls test refers to. \r\n\r\n@bradfitz @agl How do we proceed?",
