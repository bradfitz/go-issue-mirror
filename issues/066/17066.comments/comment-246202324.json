I'd reluctant to block waiting for their settings. Maybe we could block up to 100ms or something? I don't know.\r\n\r\nI guess it depends how long this nginx bug will be in the wild.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to go all the way, we could retry on REFUSED_STREAM if we hadn't written DATA yet, or buffer, but that seems like a lot of work if it's a temporary fix only.",
