	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo version go1.6 linux/amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/home/jfmyers9/go\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/usr/local/go\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64\"\r\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\"1\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nRun `go test` in crypto/ssh. You will eventually see this failure on random tests performing server/client handshakes.\r\n\r\n```\r\n=== RUN  TestSessionShell\r\n--- FAIL: TestSessionShell (0.01s)\r\nsession_test.go:67: unable to dial remote side: ssh: handshake failed: ssh: unexpected message type 21 (expected 6)\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nA passing test.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nWe see a failure for an unexpected message type. After digging into the issue, it appears that the `handshakeTransport.readPacket` method is used to perform the key exchange, but also in order to read packets in the client/server authentication flow. When a key exchange is initiated during authentication, we can experience failures as the packet returned by the above method is actually the `msgNewKeys` message which is the result of successfully performing the key exchange.\r\n\r\nWe went about solving this by making the [following commit](https://github.com/jfmyers9/crypto/commit/24edb00c618df80c93dd46d895e1dcf4eb50c635)\r\n\r\nCould you provide some feedback on the proposed changes and help us progress with getting the above fix into the additional crypto libraries?",
