	"body": "`tls.Config` provides a `GetCertificate` function for providing TLS certificates dynamically. I suggest to add a `GetClientCAs` function to provide the same for the `ClientCAs` field.\r\n\r\nRationale: On a server the `ClientCAs` field is used for client certificate authentication but to my knowledge it isn't possible to extend the list of client certificates at runtime without interruption of existing connections (restart service or listener) since `x509.CertPool` is a struct and not safe for use by multiple go routines. A `GetClientCAs` function would also mirror the `GetCertificate` function.\r\n\r\nI have written a reverse proxy http://github.com/eBay/fabio for which I've added the dynamic reloading of TLS certificates without restart and would like to provide the same functionality for the client cert authentication.\r\n\r\nI'm willing to write the change if this is something that could be accepted. Target would be Go 1.8 obviously.\r\n",
