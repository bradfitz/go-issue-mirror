	"body": "by **xapwing**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003ego version = 1.0.2\n\nwindows 7\n\ngopath=c:\\dir1;c:\\dir2\n\ndirectory structure:\nc:\\dir1\\src\\\n           hello\\\n               hello.go\nc:\\dir1\\bin\nc:\\dir2\\src\\\n           hello\\\n               hello.go\nc:\\dir2\\bin\n\nTrigger of the problem:\nI run \u0026quot;go install\u0026quot; in either of the \u0026quot;hello\u0026quot; directories\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n  a generated hello.exe in the \u0026quot;bin\u0026quot; directory related to the base dir where the src dir is in\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n   hello.exe is generated in the same \u0026quot;hello\u0026quot; directory as the source hello.go is\n\nConclusion so far:\n   if the same project name occurs in more than one subpaths of a gopath, go install will behave differently and put the .exe file not in the bin but in the src directory\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
