The [Go language spec suggests](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Switch_statements) in its example that such construct is possible:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nswitch i := x.(type) {\r\ncase bool, string:\r\n\tprintString(\"type is bool or string\")\r\ndefault:\r\n\tprintString(\"don't know the type\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we see the same `case` statement for both `bool` and `string`. Why wouldn't it be possible for two different types that implement the same interface, like in my example above?\r\n\r\n",
