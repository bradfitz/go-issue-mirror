	"title": "net: apply ICANN/IANA-managed semantics to IP.IsGlobalUnicast",
	"body": "net.IP.IsGlobalUnicast() applies incorrect address semantics.  The current implementation returns True if the address is not Unspecified, Loopback, LinkLocal, or Multicast.  However, a Global Unicast address, by definition, excludes more than just those categories.  Class E space is to be excluded, as is all of RFC1918 \u0026 RFC6598.\r\n\r\nThis manifests in a few significant ways:\r\n\r\nnet.ParseIP(\"255.255.255.255\").IsGlobalUnicast() currently returns True\r\nnet.ParseIP(\"10.1.2.3\").IsGlobalUnicast() currently returns True\r\n\r\nI would propose the following changes:\r\n\r\n* Rename IsGlobalUnicast() to IsUnicast()\r\n* Add a check to IsUnicast() to exclude Class E and broadcast addresses\r\n* Create a new IsGlobalUnicast() which extends IsUnicast() by also excluding RFC1918 \u0026 RFC6598 addresses\r\n\r\nIdeally, it would be even better to extend both further using the tables in RFC6890 as a guideline.",
