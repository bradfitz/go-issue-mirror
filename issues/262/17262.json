	"body": "This proposal is a simplification of #12488.\r\n\r\nIn short, if the user has not set `$GOPATH` in their environment the `go` tool will default to a value of `GOPATH=$HOME/gocode`.\r\n\u003chr\u003e\r\n*Rationale*\r\nAt the moment all the documentation we have says \"you have to set a GOPATH\", then people get distracted and upset because they don't understand why they have to do this.\r\n\r\nBy choosing a default GOPATH, we can make our documentation easier because we can say things like\r\n```\r\n$ go get github.com/foo/bar\r\n```\r\nwill check out the `github.com/foo/bar` repo into `$HOME/gocode/src/github.com/foo/bar`. \r\n\r\nWe don't need to distract newcomers with having to set an env var, all we need to do is put a little parenthetical note at the bottom of the page\r\n\r\n\u003e `$HOME/gocode` is the default path to your go workspace. If you want to change this path, set the `GOPATH` variable to something of your choosing.\r\n\r\n*Compatibility*\r\nThis proposal only changes the experience for newcomers who have not chosen to set a `$GOPATH` variable. For anyone using Go 1.1-1.7 today, your experience will be unchanged as you are currently required to set `$GOPATH`.",
