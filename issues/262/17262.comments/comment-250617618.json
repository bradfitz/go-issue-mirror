	"body": "My usage is not the normal one. I do scientific research, and I have found it very effective to not just have `gopath/src` and `gopath/bin`, but also `gopath/data` and `gopath/results`. This makes it easy to copy the source files over to a new system without also having to copy the (gigabytes of) result files. The new system (say a cluster) generates new results files, and I can copy those results to a central location. It's really easy to then say   `gopath = os.Getenv(\"GOPATH\")`, and save a file to something like `filepath.Join(gopath, \"results\", \"projectname\", result.json)`.",
