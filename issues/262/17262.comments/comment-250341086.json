I started prototyping this a while back, but it added significant complexity both to the go tool and the user experience.\r\n\r\nI'm not in the loop of what's been happening with the package management working group, but I can imagine a not-too-distant future where GOPATH is eliminated entirely.\r\n\r\nThat said, even if GOPATH does disappear some time in the near future, there may still be value in setting a default. If we do think GOPATH is likely to disappear, it doesn't matter too much what we set it to.\r\n\r\nFrom what I read above, there is some consensus that:\r\n\r\n1. As a default, `GOPATH=$HOME` is too invasive.\r\n2. The default should include the string `go` somewhere (likely as a prefix).\r\n\r\nI'm not worried about GOPATH being a clone of the main go repo (i.e., GOPATH == GOROOT). People checking out the go repo are likely to have a GOPATH set. The go tool would detect the conflict anyway, as it does today.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, the most succinct default would be `$HOME/go`, which I think is quite reasonable.",
