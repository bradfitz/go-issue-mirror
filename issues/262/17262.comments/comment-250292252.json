So I'm not too worried about smashing $HOME/go accidentally.\r\n\r\nI still wonder if instead of a fixed default we should be auto-sniffing the current directory's parents to figure out where GOPATH is. This is what many source tools do these days (for example, every version control system), so it's a concept people would understand. And it doesn't force them to use one directory name or to have only one GOPATH workspace. But we might as well have that discussion on the original issue.",
