	"body": "I tend to agree with Chris and Andrew: if there's going to be a default GOPATH, it should be just $HOME/go, not gopath or gocode. _Most_ users do not have a Go distribution checked out there (and everyone who does today already sets GOPATH, so this won't bother them). The default needs to make sense for new users, not advanced ones, and for most users $HOME/go makes a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nJaana raised a concern about the go command getting confused if $HOME/go happens to be a Go distribution, but the go command already checks for accidental GOPATH=$GOROOT. It's easy to check if that's true when GOPATH is set implicitly as well. In fact it would also be easy to augment the check to look for, say, $HOME/go/src/cmd/go/alldocs.go, to avoid confusion even when GOROOT!=$HOME/go but $HOME/go does contain a Go distribution.\r\n",
