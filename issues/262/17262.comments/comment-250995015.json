In such case, I think $HOME/go would be the best for GOROOT.\r\n\r\nIf you are on a Linux system, I would argue that the best place for $GOROOT might be in $HOME/.local/opt/go, not $HOME/go, depending on how you interpret the purpose of $HOME/.local, as only $HOME/.local/share (appearing to mirror /usr/local/share) is defined in the XDG Base directory spec: https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html.\r\n\r\nOne could also argue that the best default for GOPATH / GOBIN (on Linux) should be:\r\nGOPATH=$XDG_DATA_HOME/go, or $HOME/.local/share/go\r\nGOBIN=$HOME/.local/bin\r\n\r\nHowever that's probably not the easiest to understand for new users? And it would also leave it unclear what's the best approach on Windows. $HOME/go  and $USERPROFILE/go does seem pragmatic.",
