	"body": "The proposal process document at https://github.com/golang/proposal doesn't mention how the proposals are evaluated/voted. According to the doc, it is a democratic process where the community votes are involved. If the bets are 50-50, there is an arbiter involved. What is document there, imho, is a misleading. The reality is there are certain parties who has more influence in the design and development of the language, hence agreement is critically dependent of the agreement of those parties. Documenting how the process work and how the proposals are evaluated can address the issue reported at https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16339#issuecomment-247439871.\r\n\r\n/cc @adg @ulikunitz",
