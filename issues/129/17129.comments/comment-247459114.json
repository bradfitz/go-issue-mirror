	"body": "+100 to this. The doc makes it seem like the community will reach an eventual agreement/decision, and not the Go team. This is misleading. In asking the community for feedback and documenting that the decision will be made via communal agreement, but then having the Go team (in this case Russ) make the final call will lead to very frustrated, angry, possibly bashing gophers. This has been made apparent by the feedback on the alias declaration proposal after the proposal was accepted. \r\nWe don't want this frustration and negativity in our community. We want to reduce the opportunity for creating tension and hostility between gophers as much as possible.\r\nI think just a change in the documentation - more transparency in the process - is a simple way to alleviate this. We need to document that a proposal acts as a venue for community feedback, but the final decision is made by the Go team.\r\n@griesemer @rsc @spf13 ",
