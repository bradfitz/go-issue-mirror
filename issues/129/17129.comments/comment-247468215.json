There's no clear definition of the \"go team\". I sent a CL to s/adg/rsc/. I can't think of anyone more capable or deserving of the role. We should trust him to make the right call, even when we don't agree with it.\r\n\r\nI agree with @adams-sarah that this should be made clearer in the proposal docs.",
