For some reason the\noriginal size of the input file matters. For instance, if you add 1 extra byte to the\nenclosed gzipbug.html file, the request works without a problem.\n\nI am unsure why this happens as the size requirements seem to vary wildly based on\nfiletype and have proven unpredictable at best in my tests. Either way, removing the\nContent-Length header from the ServeFile function makes all requests succeed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
