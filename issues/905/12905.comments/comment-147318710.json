Personally I think having 'addr' and 'bindaddr' is less confusing than having 'addr' and 'public_http_host', but I might be biased ;).\r\n\r\nIf we do it like this:\r\n* I'd propose changing the default 'addr' (bind address) to 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1. Otherwise, someone who wants to deploy outside of localhost would always have to set *both* 'addr' *and* 'public_http_host'.\r\n* users who previously used '-addr' will now have to change that to '-public_http_host'.\r\n\r\nNote that my approach was almost entirely backwards-compatible: it added 2 optional configuration options (bindaddr and httpbindaddr), and not setting them would lead to no change in behaviour (except from listening on 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1 by default, which is an improvement imho :) )",
