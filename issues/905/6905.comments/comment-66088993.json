You should build using the go1.2 in the main repo, and the head of\nrelease-branch.go1.2 in the go.tools repo.\n\nThe binary distributions were rolled using those commits at launch, but I reserve the\nright to reproduce them at any time using go.tools from the release-branch.go1.2 head.\n\nIf you really, really want to have a fully reproducible build then I suggest you hard\ncode the relevant go.tools revision somewhere. I don't want to start tagging releases in\nsub-repositories.\u003c/pre\u003e",
