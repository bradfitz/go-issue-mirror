(if only we could!)\r\n\r\nFunctions in package bytes returning bools or ints such as Compare, Contains, Count, Equal, EqualFold, HasPrefix, HasSuffix, Index, IndexAny, IndexBytes, IndexFunc, etc are fine. The mostly-useless ones are the ones returning []byte copies.\r\n\r\nWe have to keep them for compatibility, but there's no need to add more.\r\n",
