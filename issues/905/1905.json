Firefox has undefined behaviour.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nlinux (mmd64)\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nc98449d685d2 weekly/weekly.2011-05-22\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nhttp.ServeFile fails with compressed streams because it sets the\n\u0026quot;Content-Length\u0026quot; header to the size of the uncompressed file. \nThis causes the browser to think it received only a portion of the data and therefor\ninitiates the Range dance. This will fail because the server has nothing more to offer.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1905/0/gzipbug.tar\"\u003egzipbug.tar\u003c/a\u003e (966 bytes)",
