	"body": "The pages served by the h2demo server contains links for switching (among other things) jumping from the HTTP/1 version of the site to the HTTP/2 version of the site.\r\n\r\nIf you want to expose the demo server on, say 'https://pi.bzzt.net:4430' instead of on 'localhost', you can specify this with the '-addr' command-line option. However, this parameter is not only used for generating the links in the HTML, it is also used to determine on which IP address to bind.\r\n\r\nWhen the IP address the rendered hostname resolves to is not known as a local address on the machine on which h2demo is started (for example because there is a reverse proxy in front of it), h2demo will fail to bind (and thus fail to start).\r\n\r\nOne possible way to allow the above scenario is to allow separately setting the address on which the demo server is visible from the 'outside' and the address on which to bind.\r\n\r\nCode at https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/15090/",
