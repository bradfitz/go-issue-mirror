	"body": "Various comments in the API of bytes.Buffer say that failure to allocate a buffer causes ErrTooLarge to be returned.  I think they're all false, since they assume that the error caused by the call to `make` in `makeSlice` is a panic that can be recovered from using `recover`, when in fact it is a fatal error, at least in the gc implementation (though this behavior isn't prescribed by the spec).\r\n\r\nI don't think the API as specified can be implemented without runtime magic and/or a spec change.  We should probably strike all mention of ErrTooLarge but leave the variable there with a deprecation comment.\r\n",
