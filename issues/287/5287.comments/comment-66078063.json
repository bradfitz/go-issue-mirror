I\ndon't think it's reasonable to let two programs fight over the same signal handlers. \nRather than an approach like your patch, perhaps it would make more sense to have some\nway to disable the Go signal handlers.  Ultimately the two programs need to come to some\nagreement on which is going to handle signals.\u003c/pre\u003e",
