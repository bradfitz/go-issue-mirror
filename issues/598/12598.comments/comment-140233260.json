I have access to another OnePlus, CM 12 this time and will test that later. \r\n\r\nSo these are the net environments I have the listed devices tested. Note that I did not test each device at every location. Just the sum of all locations where these tests have been performed. \r\n\r\n1) Los Angeles Tmobile LTE\r\n2) Los Angeles Charter Cable (Wifi)\r\n3) Shanghai Unicom LTE\r\n4) Shanghai China Telecom Fiber (Wifi)\r\n\r\nSo the issue from my pov:\r\n\r\n1) Not Android specific. from 4.3 to 5.1.1\r\n2) Not cpu specific: x86, qualcomm, mediatek\r\n3) Not Manufacture specific: all over the place.\r\n4) Not location specific: US, China\r\n5) Not connectivity specific: Wifi, LTE\r\n6) Not dev machine specific. Compiled and tested apk on separate dev machines. \r\n\r\nI am as perplexed as you are, especially the fact you weren't able to reproduce the result on your OnePlus.\r\n",
