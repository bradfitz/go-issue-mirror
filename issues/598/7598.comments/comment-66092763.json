I've never imagined that it would be possible, but\nBIS-style implementation might be, but for what purposes? hm, interesting.\n\nI can't say it's a expected behavior, but it's pretty Windows-specific, so leave to Alex\nor other Windows expert.\n\ngregory.tseng: I have no clue how to fix (fix?) this because at the moment we do almost\nnothing to control Windows  networking stack. Perhaps a workaround would be \"please\ndon't do that\" for years.\nSee \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/src/pkg/net/sockopt_windows.go\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/src/pkg/net/sockopt_windows.go\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **os-windows**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **New**._",
