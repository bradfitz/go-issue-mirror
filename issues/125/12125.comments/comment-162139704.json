The pattern would be something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nruntime.LockOSThread()\r\nunshare(2) to get private name space for thread\r\ndo bind/mounts\r\nForkExec or cmd.Start\r\nsetns(2) to reconnect to original name space\r\nruntime.UnlockOSThread()\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can do the sequence in a goroutine if you want to make sure not to affect a possible thread lock in the caller.\r\n",
