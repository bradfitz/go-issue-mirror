	"body": "The code contributed to the [go-pkcs12](http://github.com/Azure/go-pkcs12) repo for reading PKCS12 format had a pull request for writing PKCS12 format too, but it was decided to hold off on write support until after read support was merged.  I propose that this change now be included.\r\n\r\n@AGWA is the original author, but I am happy to bring his changes over too.",
