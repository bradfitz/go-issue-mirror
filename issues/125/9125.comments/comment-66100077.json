The easiest way to permanently pin memory is to allocate it in C, which of course\nrequires manual deallocation.  I don't know enough about the Windows syscall package,\nbut it's conceivable that on Windows the syscall package will need to provide a function\nto allocate pinned memory, again with manual deallocation.\n\nThis is related to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/8310\"\u003eissue #8310\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e",
