	"body": "@quentinmit That comment is obsolete. I've sent a cl to update it. The \"compromise\" solution is to allow reading labels, but not on ProfileLabels returned by the runtime. So that allows us to read labels we keep in the context (because they're never set from a ProfileLabels returned by the runtime), while disallowing GLS.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have LabelsFromContext, but I don't think it's strictly necessary (at least for now). You can get all the nice pprof benefits of adding labels without needing to read the labels on a context. It would be really easy to add LabelsFromContext later. -- I'm not saying that we shouldn't add it, but we can (if we want) wait until later to do so.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to have LabelsFromContext return a runtime.ProfileLabels. Any ProfileLabels set on a context using DoWithLabels should be readable.",
