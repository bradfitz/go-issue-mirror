For many things this would\neven be more flexible, apart from some performance critical bits. But a language\nlevel change is necessary if you want to have complex number literals written in the\nstandard notation (using i or j as root -1). Also the basic math ops (+,-,*,/) would\nneed to operate on complex numbers - right now they are overloaded to work seamlessly\non the various int and floating point types; I believe it would make sense to extend\nthis to cmplx, cmplx32, cmplx64. \n\nI recall that python did not have complex numbers for many years - they were added\nonly when numeric-python (the ancestor of numpy/scipy) started taking off.\u003c/pre\u003e",
