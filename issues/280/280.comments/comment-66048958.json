The C complex types are paramaterized, so to speak, on the underlying\nfloating point size: float complex, double complex, and long double complex. So\ninstead of having a simple complex type you have a complex float or complex float32,\netc, but that's hardly out of line with the rest of Go. The hard part would be adding\nthe complex type to Go's built in types. After that you just need to export the\ncmath.h functions into a complex package.\n\nI would hardly gives this A#1 top priority but I think that it should be added\neventually. It would simplify numerics and it's better to reuse the existing C\nlibrary than recreating troublesome numerical analytically \"touchy\" functions in N\nmutually incomprehensible libraries.\u003c/pre\u003e",
