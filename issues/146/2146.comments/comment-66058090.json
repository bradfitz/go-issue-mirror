The request Headers field is\n    // guaranteed to be initialized.\n    RoundTrip(req *Request) (resp *Response, err os.Error)\n\nThe only reason it does so, though, is to guard against Request.URL being nil, and\ninstead populating it based on parsing Request.RawURL.\n\nI'd first prefer to have it documented what the precedence and relationship between URL\nand RawURL was.  We've documented the rest of Request's fields well, but not those two.\n\nAlternatively, the Transport code could clone the *Request and only mutate its private\ncopy but I worry about people assuming pointer equality of requests with chained\ntransports (e.g. people using \u003ca href=\"http://gorilla-web.appspot.com/pkg/gorilla/context/\"\u003ehttp://gorilla-web.appspot.com/pkg/gorilla/context/\u003c/a\u003e ).\n\nOr I could just change Transport to pass around a Request wrapper type with extra state.\n\nBut before I do that, let's discuss URL vs RawURL.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
