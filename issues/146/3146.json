What do you see instead?\n\n- In all cases, the same local method main.localT.m should be called. However, in the\ncase of type myT3 (which is the same as myT2 except that the embedded fields are in a\ndifferent order), the wrong non-exported method m from package lib is invoked instead.\n\nThis is clearly a compiler/runtime bug. The spec is not clear on this topic but the\nissue remains valid. There are related issues 1536, 1550, and 1551 (main issue).\u003c/pre\u003e",
