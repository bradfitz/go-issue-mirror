This is a long-standing feature of the socket network API.  If it doesn't work on Dragonfly (I don't know whether it does or not), that has to be considered a bug in Dragonfly.\r\n\r\nSO_REUSEPORT is much newer.  It permits multiple servers to bind to the same local address.  That is not what we want here.",
