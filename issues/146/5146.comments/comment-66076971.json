Don't do it.\n\nIt is unfortunate that strip removes some sections from Go exe without any hesitation. \n\nIt removes all dwarf sections and also symbol table offsets from pe-header. Perhaps\nsomething can be done to make whatever remains run. But I don't think it is acceptable\nin any circumstances.\n\nLeaving for others to decide what to do.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-windows**._",
