	"body": "@bradfitz  Thank you for opening the issue :)\r\n\r\nNow you have changed the subject line of this bug \" Golang os.FindProcess is giving wrong error information to os: document that FindProcess is a no-op on Unix \"\r\n\r\nI am using latest version of Golang and didn't saw that error message problem have solved. If error message problem had not solved yet then you should have raised separate documentation issue. Mixing of both documentation and code change issue really confusing. \r\n\r\nAny way closing of issue should only happen when you provide following things:\r\n1) It should be not a bug\r\n2) It have patch in current release or whatever release and its no longer reproducible\r\n3) this issue is same copy of another issue which had raised by another community member.\r\n\r\nIf it have not solved and if i get time then  i might think about to solve this issue and send  a patch.\r\n\r\nThank you :)\r\n\r\n",
