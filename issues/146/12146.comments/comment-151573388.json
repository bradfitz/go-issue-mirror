	"body": "I agree that tests probably shouldn't rely on sorting and I'd be comfortable forcing newly-written tests to adopt more granular testing (option 2).  However, that also means that any examples that output JSON would be unstable and they would fail during tests, since the examples only allow using a string to compare the output to.  That effectively means no examples that output JSON-encoded maps are viable.\r\n\r\nI think that resolving the sorting some other way would be idea.  Perhaps (in the future) we can have a \"SortKeys(keys []reflect.Value)\" or \"SortedKeys() []interface{}\" that the underlying map type may optionally implement to produce specifically sorted keys, and the encoding/json package will have an appropriate default for string keys.",
