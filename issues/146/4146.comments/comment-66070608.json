It's still a separate preprocessor. I'd be much more\nexcited if we could get rid of all the Go file generation entirely.\nThat's a qualitative difference.\n\nHowever, even with runtime type construction I don't believe you can\neliminate the other half. You need something at compile time for the\nmock user to import.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
