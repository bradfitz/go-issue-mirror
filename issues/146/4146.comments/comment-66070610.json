The compiler must see a definition of a struct or\ninterface with an EXPECT method at compile time in order to build\nthat. Where did that come from? Here's a line from\nsample/user_test.go:\n\n        mockIndex.EXPECT().Put(\"b\", gomock.Eq(2)) // matchers work too\n\nI don't see how the compiler can compile that line without a\ngomock-generated import defining something with a Put method that will\naccept gomock.Eq(2) as an argument.\u003c/pre\u003e",
