A reasonable solution might\ninvolve, along with documentation updates, the suggestion to wrap the input with a\nbufio.Reader (or anything else implementing the ability to UngetRune) - except that\nbufio doesn't have that ability.  Instead it has Peek, which could be used by the\nscanning code if it were written differently.\n\nUngetRune in bufio seems simpler.  At the moment, it can only back up one byte. Taken\nunder advisement.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
