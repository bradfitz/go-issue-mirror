Even if you succeed in displacing\na established meaning, you don't win--you just offend people.\n\nOther examples of dumb names, in case you need to be hit over the head with\nit: C, C++, X, widget, R, S, NeXT, and processing. I'm sure that now that\nyou have the idea you can generate more bad names yourself, but please don't.\n\nThanks,\n  John\u003c/pre\u003e",
