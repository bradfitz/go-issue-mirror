	"body": "@BenC- thanks for your issue report, i've confirmed this is a possible issue related to inlining or escape analysus. Running the sample program with `-gcflags=-l` resolves the issue. This is at revision 505fa7b42338f0aba7e4235acbc8274a20f3c1f0 which was around the beta2 release,\r\n\r\nHowever, at 33a784e1f7fc56ecea696ab07558ca220e3bef0f the issue is gone. I suspect that this was fixed by @dr2chase 's recent escape analysis fixes.",
