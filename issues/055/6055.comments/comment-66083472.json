Nothing is wrong with the\nrest of the code, gostartcallfn is just trying to start the deferred routine and segvs\nwhen trying to read from the FuncVal*.\n\nThe address 0x20 comes from \u0026((Itab*)nil).fun.  Looks like calling defer on a method of\na nil interface value barfs.  I'll see if I can't make a simple example.\u003c/pre\u003e",
