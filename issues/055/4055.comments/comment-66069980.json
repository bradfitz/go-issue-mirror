With maps it was more visible\nsince \"a[b] = c\" looks like you are modifying something and then you have a question of\natomicity.\n\nI think some people may stumble upon this problem again. If you think there's no need to\nmodify func declaration/documentation it's ok, maybe they can find this issue thread\ninstead.\u003c/pre\u003e",
