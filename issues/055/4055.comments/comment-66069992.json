Quoting from \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/ref/spec#Appending_and_copying_slices\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/ref/spec#Appending_and_copying_slices\u003c/a\u003e:\n\n\"If the capacity of s is not large enough to fit the additional values, append allocates\na new, sufficiently large slice that fits both the existing slice elements and the\nadditional values. Thus, the returned slice may refer to a different underlying array.\"\n\nI basically just want to add these 2 sentences to the Slices article, which should make\nthe semantics of append clear enough.\u003c/pre\u003e",
