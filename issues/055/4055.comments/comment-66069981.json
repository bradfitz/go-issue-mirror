It\nreturns a new one of those precisely because it cannot modify the\nslice.\nHowever, if len \u0026lt; cap it does write to the storage pointed at by\nptr+len. So whether append is safe for use by multiple goroutines\ndepends on whether len \u0026lt; cap. In general it's not, but if len == cap\nthen it is safe. It is not as clear cut as any of your choices\nsuggest.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://research.swtch.com/godata\"\u003ehttp://research.swtch.com/godata\u003c/a\u003e if you would like a slice refresher.\u003c/pre\u003e",
