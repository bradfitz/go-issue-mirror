It modifies the\ncontents of the slice passes as its first argument.  When you invoke append concurrently\nwith the same slice, it modifies the contents of that slice concurrently.  This violates\nthe Go memory model and the behaviour of your program is unpredictable.\n\nChanging append to take a pointer to a slice would not avoid this problem.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
