So it's running somewhere after the write(). The question is what exactly it\nis doing.\n\n\u003e that looks like the futex associated with the test.timeout=15s firing, but it doesn't\ncause anything to happen in the test.\n\nI guess you are running with GOMAXPROCS=1, so the times goroutine is not scheduled\nbecause another goroutine is already running.\n\nFor now it looks like foo.(*thread).start(0xc2000f0b80) goroutine hang in infinite loop.\u003c/pre\u003e",
