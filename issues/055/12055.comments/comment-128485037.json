	"body": "A while ago I modified the setup script (src/cmd/dist/buildruntime.go:stackGuardMultiplier) to allocate larger guard regions if we compile without optimizations.  It allowed us to do no-opt builders, but it requires that -N be passed to make.bash when originally building the distribution.  It does not fix the situation here where Go is built normally and then the application is built with -N.\r\n\r\nTry rebulding Go with \"GO_GCFLAGS=-N make.bash\" and then run your test, it should pass.  I'm not sure if that would be a long-term solution for you, but it will let us know whether this is the same problem or a different one.",
