	"body": "@rsc At golang.org/cl/9660, you describe golang.org/cl/9112 as unfortunate, which seems contradictory to your above comments from March 20.  Can you please elaborate?\r\n\r\nIn case the CL description wasn't clear, the only constants that were converted from package ld to package obj were the ones removed from cmd/internal/ld/link.go.  See: https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/9112/3/src/cmd/internal/ld/link.go\r\n\r\nRe-reviewing the CL, the \"LSym.type\", \"Reloc.type\", and \"Auto.name\" constants (which make up about 2/3rd of the CL) are all serialized into object files, so it seems undesirable to allow the compiler and linker values to diverge.\r\n\r\nConverting ld.HistVersion to obj.HistVersion perhaps was unnecessary, but that's easily fixed: there was only one use of ld.HistVersion that was converted.\r\n\r\nConverting ld.Hlinux, etc. to obj.Hlinux (~1/3rd of the CL) was arguably unnecessary too, but it seems unlikely that we'd intentionally want the compilers and linkers to support divergent sets of GOOS values.",
