Before we call 'go build', /vendor folders of every module should be empty. Then, in the 'main one' (the one being go build'd), we fetch the dependencies of all the packages and putting them into its /vendor folder. At the end, go will find only one occurrence of a package into that folder.\r\n\r\nDoes that makes sense? Am I missing something?",
