It would also lead to a proliferation of symbols (most likely).  Russ seemed to think (I hope I am not putting words in his mouth) that it would be perhaps okay to just drop PCs from the old interface, as long as we provide a new way to obtain all the funcs/files/lines that apply at a given call site and use that for usual-case user-visible stack traces.  I.e., it's not entirely clear that the customers for slices of caller-PC have much use for fake PCs anyhow.",
