	"title": "proposal: x/mobile audio",
	"body": "In the scope of the Go mobile project, an audio package that supports decoding and playback is a top priority. The current status of audio support under x/mobile is limited to OpenAL bindings and an experimental high-level audio player that is backed by OpenAL.\r\n\r\nThe current experimental audio package fails to\r\n- provide high level abstractions to represents audio and audio processors,\r\n- implement a memory-efficient playback model,\r\n- implement decoders (e.g. an mp3 decoder),\r\n- support live streaming or other networking audio sources.\r\n\r\nIn order to address these concerns, I am proposing core abstractions and a minimal set of features based on the proposed abstractions to provide decoding and playback support.\r\n\r\nSee the proposal document for further details.",
