	"body": "I tried out the change I proposed, and it seems to do the trick. Incoming network events continue at their usual rate during the concurrent GC, rather than becoming less frequent. The delay between incoming network events and the resumption of the goroutines they unblock is often several microseconds rather than several milliseconds. Goroutines that are scheduled during the concurrent GC often run for just a few hundred microseconds (I dialed down `gcOverAssistBytes` to 64kiB as well).\r\n\r\nI'll share an execution trace and some output of gctrace and gcpacertrace soon, and mail a CL.\r\n\r\nAre there any circumstances under which a fix for this would be part of go1.7?",
