It's at https://github.com/aclements/go-gcbench/blob/master/gcbench/progs/rpc.go. I run it with GOMAXPROCS set to half my CPUs (since the client and server are separate processes) and fiddle with -reqs-per-sec until I get about 1 GC/sec, which is about -reqs-per-sec 5000 on my laptop with GOMAXPROCS=2.\r\n\r\nI haven't tried any runtime changes with it yet.",
