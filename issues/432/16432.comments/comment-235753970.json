We're keeping a close eye on it and running internal tests, which I should have the results of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThat's great news, thank you! Its behavior looks good in the few services I operate.\r\n\r\nI still see that nearly all Ps can end up running their gcBgMarkWorker goroutines, largely starving the mutator of CPU time. I've got an example of 35/36 Ps doing that for around 16ms while the run queue (per \"Goroutines\" row) is non-empty. It doesn't happen on every GC, so most collections (at ccca9c9, with CL 25155 merged) allow the mutator to continue running with low latency.\r\n\r\n@aclements do you have a separate issue open to track your plans for preempting the idle mark worker?",
