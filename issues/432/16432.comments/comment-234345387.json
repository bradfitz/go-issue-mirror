Given the duration of many of the gcBgMarkWorker runs and the amount of idle time shown outside of GC in the trace, I would guess that these are idle workers, which run for 10ms when invoked (which was probably a bad idea). @rhysh, could you try https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/24706/? That isn't really the \"right\" fix for this problem, but it should make it clear in the trace if this is the problem by chopping most of the gcBgMarkWorkers into much shorter windows, and it may help somewhat with latency.",
