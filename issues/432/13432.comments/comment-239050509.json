	"body": "@mewmew we decided to reduce the scope of the proposal to an interface allowing reading and writing of PCM data. We are currently working on various test implementations covering multiple use cases (audio analysis, processing and playback) with a few different formats and platforms.\r\n\r\nThe big challenge is defining an interface that is multi-purpose yet flexible enough to support various kind of codecs. As we started implemented our ideas, we started finding issues/challenges and went back to the drawing board. As soon as we have decent implementations validating our design, we will submit an updated proposal.",
