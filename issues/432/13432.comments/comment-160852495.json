	"body": "It looks great!\r\n\r\nHow about adding `AudioFormat string` to the `Clip` interface?  For instance a wav audio file can be encoded in a variety of coding formats. It might not belong to the interface since it's a detail that maybe only the decoder cares but I can think of a few examples where it would be useful.\r\n\r\n\u003e WAV and AIFF both support float PCM values even though the use of float values is unpopular. Should we consider supporting float values?\r\n\r\nI think we should, any kind of audio processing would more than likely done in float values, using float right away seems to be a better move IMHO (not a deal breaker tho).\r\n\r\n\u003e Decoding on desktop. The package will use the system codec libraries provided by Android and iOS on mobile devices. It is not possible to provide feature parity for desktop envs in the scope of decoding.\r\n\r\nWe can implement the decoders in pure Go code for when codecs are not available. I have partially implemented such decoders and while they might not be as fast as dedicated/optimized codecs, I think they should work well enough.",
