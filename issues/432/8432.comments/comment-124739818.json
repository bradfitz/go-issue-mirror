My use case is building ethernet frames and ARP packets to send and receive ARP data in a fashion similar to `net/http`.\r\n\r\nI would love to team up with others who are more familiar with system calls and facilities of other platforms to create a solid `x/net/ether` package or similar.  Here's hoping that https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10565 is resolved for Go 1.6 so we can also take advantage of the runtime network poller.",
