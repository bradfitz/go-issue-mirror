	"body": "Spec (https://golang.org/ref/spec#Method_declarations): \"The receiver is specified via an extra parameter section preceeding the method name. That parameter section must declare a single parameter, the receiver. Its type must be of the form T or \\*T (possibly using parentheses) where T is a type name. The type denoted by T is called the receiver base type; it must not be a pointer or interface type and it must be declared in the same package as the method. **The method is said to be bound to the base type and the method name is visible only within selectors for that type.**\"\r\n\r\nIt says for that type, whereas according to http://golang.org/ref/spec#Selectors, it is also visible within pointers to the receiver base type. This is true whether the method has a pointer or a value receiver.  It's being misleading, unless selectors on both `T` and `*T` values are considered selectors for `T`, which should be stated more clearly if it's the case. If it isn't the case, then the spec is incorrect and needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\n",
