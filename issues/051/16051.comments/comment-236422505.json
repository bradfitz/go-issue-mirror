	"body": "I prepared a self-contained benchmark that highlights real-world cgo performance issues here: https://github.com/rasky/tdb-cgo-bench. It's an example that uses the cgo wrapper of TrailDB, which highlights a real-world case where the overhead of cgo is very high. The included benchmark shows a 6x performance regression when executing the same basic code in Go vs C. I hope this can be useful while working on cgo performances in the 1.8 cycle.",
