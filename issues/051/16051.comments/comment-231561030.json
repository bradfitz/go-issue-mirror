But I might be wrong. If you have some real numbers to show one way or other, we could try and make it faster.\r\n\r\n\u003e Windows syscalls can have callbacks, so the generality may be necessary\r\n\r\nVery few Go windows apps use callbacks - the ones who do call syscall.NewCallback. We could optimize the app if it doesn't calls syscall.NewCallback.\r\n\r\nAlex",
