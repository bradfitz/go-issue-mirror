	"body": "by **recv@awesam.de**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThere is currently no good way to fan out from an io.Reader to multiple readers. A\nuse-case we commonly encounter is piping data from one reader to another, and doing some\ncalculation over the piped data on the side in a goroutine.\n\nio.TeeReader gets you only half the way, and we found a nice solution based on that and\nio.Pipe.\n\nSee \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/xBBeaBdVJf\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/xBBeaBdVJf\u003c/a\u003e for an example, piping a .tar.gz from stdin to\nstdout, printing the tar headers to stderr along the way.\n\nWould you be open to introduce a similar StreamReader implementation to io/ioutils?\u003c/pre\u003e",
