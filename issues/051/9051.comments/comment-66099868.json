Using io.Copy to consume the reader is not\nexactly the definition of composing multiple readers.\n\nThere are cases where you don't have an io.Writer available to pass into io.TeeReader,\nand instead are required to pass in an io.Reader. For example, instead of writing to\nstdout, let's say you'd like to make a request with the data to some http endpoint.\nhttp.NewRequest (or http.Client.Post for that matter) takes an io.Reader, and thus you\ncan't just write to the request via io.TeeReader.
