Here's an idea to make it's intentional\nlimitations more discoverable:\n\n- add a content slot just before output, that is marked up with e.g.  background color\nthat differentiates it from output, that can contain messages; make it invisible if empty\n\n- if the code imported \u0026quot;time\u0026quot;, add message like \u0026quot;Playground is frozen in\ntime to 2009.\u0026quot;\n\n- if the code imported \u0026quot;net\u0026quot;, add message like \u0026quot;Playground has fake\nnetworking that can only communicate within the application.\u0026quot; \n\n- if either of the two messages triggered, add a link \u0026quot;See About for more.\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e",
