Restricting downloading of\nthe Go programming language is horse of a different color. I'm aware of ITAR\n(International Traffic in Arms Regulations) and OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control)\nrules but why should my legends in computer science not even let me and exclude me of\nvisiting even the website of www.golang.org and the pearl they have created?\n\nSurely, accessing the website itself is not against any rules within the United States\nbut surely it is against the spirit of BSD and CC licenses and Free software movement.\n\nBest,\nSalman,\nIran\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/7392/0/Screenshot%20from%202014-02-23%2013:36:35.png\"\u003eScreenshot from 2014-02-23 13:36:35.png\u003c/a\u003e (62502 bytes)",
