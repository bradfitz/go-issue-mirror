Would Chef 11.x ever use http2 in any sort of deployment?\r\n\r\nWhat if we just explicitly whitelist `Hashed Path`? That's gross, but so is everything else.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we do nothing and say if you don't want to upgrade from Chef 11 to Chef 12, don't upgrade from Go 1.5 to Go 1.6 either and keep your old software stack old.
