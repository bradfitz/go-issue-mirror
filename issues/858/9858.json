	"body": "Currently with the trybot code, if Go's master is A and we have pending CLs B and C on A, currently we test B-on-A and C-on-A, but then when B is merged, we're still testing C on A, instead of C-on-B.\r\n\r\nWe should do:\r\n\r\nhttps://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-changes.html#rebase-change\r\n\r\n... which will add a patch set to the change, rebased. It could get spammy, though.  Shawn says \"don't complain when you have patch set 85 on a trivial one line change\".  So maybe we want to be careful when we do it. Maybe only for auto-submit.\r\n",
