It seems like a really bad idea to allow mutability of tags in general--it's a terrible place to store global variables!--but I can see people wanting to do something like this to get various encoding/decoding systems to play nicely with each other. I'm guessing you won't want to do this so mostly I'm asking to explain why not in your proposal :)\r\n\r\n(And to reiterate what @wojtek-t said, there's no burning need for this for Kubernetes at the moment, so don't rush on our account.)",
