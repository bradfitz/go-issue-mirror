CL 7032 removes one argument to gc.Naddr, trybot passes, but\r\nthe build breaks after it's submitted because master contains cmd/7g,\r\nbut that CL is based on a commit before the introduction of 7g, so\r\nit doesn't change 7g.\r\n2. trybot reports failure for CL 7080 on nacl/amd64p32, however,\r\nthat's because the CL is based on a commit before the nacl build fix.\r\nThe trybot messages asks to see the build dashboard if the failure\r\nis a new one, and according to the dashboard, it's indeed a new\r\nfailure, but actually it's not.",
