	"body": "It's unclear from the vendor spec whether the algorithm that finds the `vendor` directory should confine itself to the same workspace source directory (in the sense of `(*build.Context).SrcDirs()`) as the import declaration, or whether it should work across the entire logical package path name space.\r\n\r\nThe implementation in `go/build` looks only within the same source directory, which seems sensible to me, but we should specify the intention because it will affect the design of interfaces such as the forthcoming `go/types.Importer2`.",
