I think we're in good shape for correctness testing, but we don't have a good solution for testing that instruction-level micro-optimizations are working as intended.\r\n\r\nFrom memory, LLVM has a lot of FileCheck (http://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html) tests, and some of them are used to inspect generated assembly instruction sequences. Maybe we could implement something similar.",
