If there is a bug\n(and it sounds like there is) you should be able to\ndemonstrate it by adding a case to response_test.go.\n\nI think the response code is using the request logic:\n\np.33 of RFC 2616:\n\n   The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the\n   inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in\n   the request's message-headers. \n\n   ...\n\n   For response messages, whether or not a message-body is included with\n   a message is dependent on both the request method and the response\n   status code (section 6.1.1). All responses to the HEAD request method\n   MUST NOT include a message-body, even though the presence of entity-\n   header fields might lead one to believe they do. All 1xx\n   (informational), 204 (no content), and 304 (not modified) responses\n   MUST NOT include a message-body. All other responses do include a\n   message-body, although it MAY be of zero length.\n\n   [rules follow]\n\nWant to fix it?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
