It's not meant to be a 1:1 drop-in.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, the go/types API and thus StdSizes is frozen. It is easy enough to either a) write an external implementation of Sizes and provide it to go/types, or perhaps add a GCSizes type that matches the gc-behavior exactly. Either way, those approaches would solve this problem in a different way.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this as unfortunate.",
