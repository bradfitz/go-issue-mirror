	"body": "by **hitesh.jasani**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the\nlatest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Run \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/6UeIwpPMGU\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/6UeIwpPMGU\u003c/a\u003e\n2.\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nAn error message indicating which field caused the unmarshaller to choke.  Something\nlike \u0026quot;json: cannot unmarshal number into Go value of type string for key/name\n'Zip'\u0026quot;\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n\u0026quot;json: cannot unmarshal number into Go value of type string\u0026quot;\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\ndefault compiler\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nOS X 10.9 (13A603)\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo version go1.2rc3 darwin/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nIn the example I provided, it is trivial to deduce that either the programmer mistakenly\ndefined the Zip code field to be string when it should have been an int or the input\njson received was invalid.  In practice, json objects are much larger and more complex. \nDetermining which field of the hundreds in the message caused the unmarshaller to choke\nis time consuming and painful.  The task could be made much easier if the field name\nwere displayed as part of the error message making it easier to track down bugs.\u003c/pre\u003e",
