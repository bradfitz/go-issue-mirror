I will close the issue then.\n\n\u003e ... the problem was that go get was trying to invoke \"cmd /C hg\" using an arbitrary\ncmd.exe ...\n\nYou keep saying that. I am yet to see it. I don't believe \"go get\" command invokes\ncmd.exe in any circumstances.\n\n\u003e ... exec.Start doesn't work with program paths found by exec.LookPath with\nnon-standard file extensions (e.g. .PY)\n\nWe do what Windows CreateProcess provides. I think it is inclusive enough. Someone who\nneeds to do something fancier, should provide appropriate command. For example, call\npython interpreter (or whatever it is called) directly.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Retracted**._",
