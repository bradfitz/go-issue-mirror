This is Scan, not Scanf, and newlines work differently in the two.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be confined to Windows, which argues against it being \\r in particular. If it were, we could reproduce it with \\r on other systems, but we cannot.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that this has to do with a difference in how Windows does console input but I doubt that is a helpful remark.",
