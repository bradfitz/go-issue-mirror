But it also doesn't say if this can ever block.\n\n\u003e sending to or closing a closed channel causes a run-time panic.\n\nI could read \"sending\" as \"new sends\" or \"also any sends already in progress\".\n\n\u003e After calling close, and after any previously sent values have been received,\n\nHere's one reference to \"and after any previously sent values have been received\", which\nwhile explicitly talking about the receiver's side, at least brings the reader to start\nthinking about if there's any behavior difference from the sender's side with regard to\nthings already in-flight.  (hence concern about close blocking)\n\n\u003e receive operations will return the zero value for the channel's type without blocking.\n\u003e The multi-valued receive operation returns a received value along with an indication of\n\u003e whether the channel is closed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
