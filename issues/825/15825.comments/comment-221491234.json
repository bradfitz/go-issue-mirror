	"body": "@ianlancetaylor thanks for trying to reproduce my problem.\r\nI have one setup here where I do get a rebuild after having done a \"go get\" on a dependency\r\nwhen doing a \"go build\" on my main file. (This is the second time I see this problem, the first time I did not inquire and a few wild \"go get\"s and \"go install\"s later it was gone.) I've tried to freshly recreate the situation of my problem-showing-setup this morning, but I found that there must be another factor.\r\nI'll keep trying a bit, if you have a hint how to diagnose this further, it would be helpful.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the missing \"compile\" in the \"go get\" section already is an inconsistency in the documentation. And given that I have a situation where I get an unexpected rebuild, some hints\r\nwould be useful in which state rebuilds occur and when not.\r\n",
