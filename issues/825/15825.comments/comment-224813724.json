My current hypothesis is, that there is something wrong in the way go handles it, \r\nbut I can observe is only with github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3. @s-l-teichmann observes a similliar\r\nissue with go-sqlite3. Maybe we should separate the go-sqlite3 rebuilding issue from the documentation\r\ninconsistency.",
