What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"386\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\n\r\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\"1\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n\r\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\"1\"                                                        \r\nCC=\"gcc\"                                                                        \r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m32 -pthread -fmessage-length=0\"                             \r\nCXX=\"g++\"                                                                       \r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"  \r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrying to build a software from source with dependencies\r\nand then continue developing this software in the cycle:\r\nchange code, recompile, run.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies shall not be recompiled each time.\r\nUsing \r\n  go get -u -v github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3\r\nand then trying to recompile with \"go build\"\r\nwith lead to recompiling go-sqlite3 each time, though it did not change.\r\nAfter an \r\n  go install github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3\r\nIt works without recompiling.\r\n\r\nThe documentation to \"go get\" says:\r\nhttps://golang.org/cmd/go/\r\n\"\"\"Download and install packages and dependencies\r\n\r\nGet downloads and installs the packages named by the import paths, along with their dependencies. \"\"\"\r\n\r\nand \"go install\" says:\r\n\"\"\"Compile and install packages and dependencies\r\n\r\nInstall compiles and installs the packages named by the import paths, along with their dependencies. \"\"\"\r\n\r\nThere are two inconsistencies:\r\na) go get  seems to also compile, otherwise I could not use it and there wouldn't be the reference \r\nto the build flags. But compilation is not mentioned.\r\nb) go install seems to do something else than just \"install\", but it is not documented.\r\n    Reason: there is a different behaviour for recompilation, but both commands list \"install\"\r\n    and \"go install\" does not describe a different additional action.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nBoth inconsistencies solved, so my mental model about what is happening can\r\nbe more easily constructed. \r\nPossily: An explanation when recompilation checks will be happen and how to avoid them.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nThe inconsistencies above.\r\n",
