	"body": "\u003cpre\u003esome quotations from the manual:\n\n``Two interface types are identical if they have the same set of methods with the same\nnames and \nidentical function types. The order of the methods is irrelevant.''\n\n``Type compatibility is less stringent than type identity: a named and an unnamed type\nare compatible if \nthe respective type literals are compatible. In all other respects, the definition of\ntype compatibility is the \nsame as for type identity listed above but with ``compatible'' substituted for\n``identical''.''\n\n``In general, a conversion succeeds if the value of x is assignment compatible with type\nT, or if the value \nwould be assignment compatible with type T if the value's type, or T, or any of their\ncomponent types \nwere unnamed.''\n\ni'm not quite sure what a \u0026quot;type literal\u0026quot; means for an interface type,\nbut perhaps it's not unreasonable to assume that it's the value\nfrom which the interface is made.\n\nthis makes me believe that the following program should work\n(and in fact it would be useful if it did, as it enables the inter-operation\nof interface types from different packages, even if some of their\ncomponent types happen to be named differently).\n\n1. What is a short input program that triggers the error?\n\npackage main\ntype Y int\ntype X1 interface {\n\tfoo() int\n}\ntype X2 interface {\n\tfoo() Y\n}\ntype T1 bool\nfunc (t T1) foo() int {\n\treturn 99\n}\n\ntype T2 bool\nfunc (t T2) foo() Y {\n\treturn 99\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tt1 := T1(false)\n\tt2 := T2(t1)       // demonstrate conversion of type literals\n\n\tx1 := X1(t1)\n\tx2 := X2(t2)\n\n\tfail := X2(x1)\n\n\tt1.foo()\n\tt2.foo()\n\tx1.foo()\n\tx2.foo()\n\tfail.foo()\n}\n\n\n2. What is the full compiler output?\n\ntst.go:26: need type assertion to use X1 as X2\n\tmissing foo() Y\n\n\n\n3. What version of the compiler are you using?  (Run it with the -V flag.)\n\n8g version 5516+\u003c/pre\u003e",
