	"body": "Thanks.  Unfortunately the traceback you showed just tells me that the program is waiting for another program to exit.  The other program is `testprogcgo.exe CgoExternalThreadSignal crash`.  We need to figure out why that program is not exiting.  If it is ignoring `^\\`, can you try something else?  Try killing the process from a different terminal, such as `kill -ILL \u003cpid\u003e`.  Or try attaching to it from a debugger and getting a stack trace.  Or try running the program under `dtruss -f`.  Any of those might help figure out what it is doing.  Thanks.",
