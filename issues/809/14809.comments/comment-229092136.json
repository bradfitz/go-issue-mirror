(In fact, the only runtime test timeouts since June 2nd have been on Plan 9.)\r\n\r\nThere was one interesting failure around that time that looks related to signals, though it wasn't this specific test: [2016-06-01T00:09:32-04acd62/linux-ppc64le-buildlet](https://build.golang.org/log/ba2e9d5cf7d67511b6e90e0b1522b3f9390ffefa). @ianlancetaylor, it looks like goroutine 207880 got preempted at the beginning of sigpanic and never came back.
