They are timeouts, so that part is similar, but they are running different tests.\r\n\r\nWhy would there be a runnable goroutine that nothing is running?  That seems to imply that all the P's are in use, which does not seem to be the case, or that all the M's are doing something, but what?, or that all the M's are blocked waiting for something, but what?\r\n\r\nSince we don't know what's going on, It's probably worth doing something so that if a runtime test time outs we get a schedtrace(true).",
