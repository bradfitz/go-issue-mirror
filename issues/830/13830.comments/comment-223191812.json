	"body": "Yes, I think we could change the `_cgoCheckPointer0` function to specify the type of the first parameter.  I think I didn't do that because I thought of `_cgoCheckPointer0` as essentially the same as the generic function `_cgoCheckPointer`, and the latter function necessarily has a first argument of type `interface{}`.\r\n\r\nAh, I see what you mean; that fixes this issue.  Thanks!  I'll try that--maybe I've forgotten some reason it won't work.",
