	"body": "The kernel differentiates between setting time to *now* vs setting it to some timestamp (that may be very very recent past). For example, FUSE sets a separate flag that signals this:\r\n\r\nhttp://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=17637cbaba592076c221dc045ca78422b4af6290\r\n\r\nThis is normally achieved by passing NULL as times to utimes(2) and friends.\r\n\r\nThe Go syscall wrappers all explicitly prevent this:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc Utimes(path string, tv []Timeval) (err error) {\r\n\tif len(tv) != 2 {\r\n\t\treturn EINVAL\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn utimes(path, (*[2]Timeval)(unsafe.Pointer(\u0026tv[0])))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy use case: I wanted to write a FUSE unit test that behaves like touch, and actually causes that flag to be set. Measuring current time and passing it as argument is not good enough.",
