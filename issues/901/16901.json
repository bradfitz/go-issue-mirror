	"body": "This is a proposal to add a `Name() string` function to `testing.TB` that returns the name of the test/benchmark. This is necessary to differentiate between debugging messages, events, traces etc when running tests/benchmarks in parallel.\r\n\r\nIn many cases one can figure out the enclosing `Test..` function by studying the caller stack but that wouldn't work for subtests. This feature would be especially useful when the subtests are generated programatically, e.g. `for i := 1; i \u003c= 5; i++ { t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"i=%d\", i), ..)`",
