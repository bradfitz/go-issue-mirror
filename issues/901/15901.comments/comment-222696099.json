	"body": "@F21 Thanks for the clear test case.  I agree with @davecheney that the shadowing is problematic, but I don't think that's the problem here.  I think the deadlock/hang is occurring because of the `defer db.Close()`.  That is run when the panic happens.  It tries to close all the connections.  Unfortunately, in doing so, it tries the lock them, but the connection is already locked.  I will send a CL.",
