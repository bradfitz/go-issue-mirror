	"body": "We should do this. Today, I'm aware of two workarounds:\r\n\r\n- Separately unmarshal the object into a map in order to obtain and inspect the key set.\r\n- Use pointers for all field values. For example, the github.com/google/go-github API wrapper [uses pointer fields](https://github.com/google/go-github/blob/master/github/issues.go#L22-L38) as a rule for this reason. (But even then, you can't distinguish between `\"k\":null` and a missing key.)\r\n\r\nBesides some way to change the decoder \"mode\" (as @adg suggested), here's another way it could work: add a `,required` struct field tag which causes Unmarshal to give an error if no key matches that field.",
