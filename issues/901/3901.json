The assumption is that you already have\na reference to the function in question (i.e. the goal is not to \u0026quot;discover\u0026quot;\nall functions in a package).\n\nIt might be useful to provide information about the package that the function belongs to\nseparately. The code in FuncName seems to work, but maybe there is a better way to do\nthe same thing.\u003c/pre\u003e",
