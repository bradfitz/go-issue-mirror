Indeed the section 3.2\nthat your quote refers to says\n   In some circumstances, the use of padding (\"=\") in base-encoded data\n   is not required or used.  In the general case, when assumptions about\n   the size of transported data cannot be made, padding is required to\n   yield correct decoded data.\n\n   Implementations MUST include appropriate pad characters at the end of\n   encoded data unless the specification referring to this document\n   explicitly states otherwise.\n\nencoding/base64 is a general-purpose package and doesn't know the context of where its\noutput will be used, so it should always be including the padding. It seems oddly\nasymmetric to allow it to be absent when decoding.\u003c/pre\u003e",
