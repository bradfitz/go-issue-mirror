	"body": "ReverseProxy doesn't follow redirects by itself, so if the proxied site redirects to itself using an absolute URL in the `Location` header (e.g. `Location: http://servername/path`), the following requests bypass the proxy.\r\n\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/DHoUpoPGnf\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if ReverseProxy had a callback field that allowed modifying the response (at least the headers).\r\n\r\nAnother use case is when you want to proxy a site that requires registration and do not want any cookies to leak from the proxied server to the client.",
