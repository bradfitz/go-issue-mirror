The memory\naccess was the load of the result, and it was being reordered early because it happened\nright after the return. That code never made it into the repo. Because we left deferproc\nreturning the result in a register, the code after the return does an immediate compare\nof the register + conditional jump before any memory access, so the memory accesses\ncannot be reordered ahead of the conditional jump.\u003c/pre\u003e",
