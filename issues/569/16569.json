	"body": "This is an extension of #14004, but applied to constants and variables.\r\n\r\nCurrently I see:\r\n```\r\n$ go doc reflect | egrep \"ChanDir|Kind\"\r\nconst RecvDir ChanDir = 1 \u003c\u003c iota ...\r\nconst Invalid Kind = iota ...\r\ntype ChanDir int\r\ntype Kind uint\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expect to see:\r\n```\r\n$ go doc reflect | egrep \"ChanDir|Kind\"\r\ntype ChanDir int\r\n    const RecvDir ChanDir = 1 \u003c\u003c iota ...\r\ntype Kind uint\r\n    const Invalid Kind = iota ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would make the `go doc` tool more consistent with itself (we do groupiing for functions, but not variables and constants) and also with the display of godoc. More importantly, it makes the printout easier to parse by human eyes.\r\n\r\n\\cc @robpike, I can make the change in Go1.8, if you're okay with this.",
