	"body": "Isn't it true that a package's output only depends on its source files and the export data of its dependencies? So if a dependency's source code changes, but the export data stays the same, then the output of the current package would also stay the same? Because the compiler still has the same input. It can't be that simple, but right now it sounds to me like a checksum across the export data could do the trick.\r\n\r\n@minux I see your point with the inlined function. However, does the compiler do cross-package inlining at the compile step or at the linker step?",
