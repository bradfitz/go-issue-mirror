	"body": "util could inline functions exported from util2, and the inlined\nfunction might access to unexported types/constants and\nfunctions in util2, so even if only private (non-exported) symbols\nchanges, util might still need to be recompiled.\n\nThe real problem here is it's just too much work to determine\nthat for the changed util2 package, util doesn't need to be\nrecompiled. It's safer to just recompile everything that directly\nor indirectly depends on the changed package.\n\nThis kind of optimization is certainly nice to have, but I think\nthey're just too hard to get right and the benefit is not as big\nas you might expect anyway (parsing and typechecking the\nutil package to determine if it needs to be recompiled is\nnon-trivial too.)\n",
