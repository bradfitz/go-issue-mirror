The number of anonymous fields traversed to\nreach f is called its depth in T. The depth of a field or method f declared in T is\nzero. The depth of a field or method f declared in an anonymous field A in T is the\ndepth of f in A plus one.\n...\nFor a value x of type T or *T where T is not an interface type, x.f denotes the field or\nmethod at the shallowest depth in T where there is such an f. If there is not exactly\none f with shallowest depth, the selector expression is illegal.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
