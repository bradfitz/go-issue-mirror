For example, 4:2:0 chroma subsampling means\nthat in a 16x16 Minimum Coded Unit, there are 2x2 luma blocks (each block is 8x8), and\n1x1 chroma block for each of U and V (the 8x8 block is stretched over the 16x16 MCU).\nThe overall scheme is called \"chroma subsampling\" but the interesting number is the 2x2,\nwhich is associated with luma.\n\nAnyway, the easy fix is to change all the messages to say \"luma/chroma downsample\nratio\". I'll do that.\u003c/pre\u003e",
