	"body": "by **tejorupan**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003epackage net/rpc does not have any provision to support streaming.\n\nUse-case (1) is retrieving 1000s of records of data from a database using SQL, in a\nloop. We may not know how many rows are going to be retrieved nor we would like to store\nall the records in memory and do the marshalling of the whole data at once, which may\nnot be memory efficient.\n\nUse case (2) is to transmit bulk data, for example the contents of a file, whose size is\nseveral mega/giga bytes.\n\nFor the above mentioned cases, we avoid the RPC layer and directly work on the\nunderlying network connection.\n\nOne interesting solution for streaming rpc is\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/youtube/vitess/tree/master/go/rpcplus\"\u003ehttps://github.com/youtube/vitess/tree/master/go/rpcplus\u003c/a\u003eâ€Ž \n\nWe need a provision to process data in chunks (streaming mode) instead of waiting for\nthe whole datastructure to be populated first.\u003c/pre\u003e",
