What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n1.6 and tip\r\n\r\nIf we look at this bit of code: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/go/importer/importer.go#L26-L36 you can see that For(\"compiler\", lookup) panics if and only if lookup is nil, which is the wrong way around.\r\n\r\nIf 1.6 had not been released, this would be a trivial fix. But now that it has, should For continue to accept (and ignore) a lookup function for gccgo?",
