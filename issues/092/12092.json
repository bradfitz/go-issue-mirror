	"body": "godoc's HTTP viewer by default appears to hide `internal/` directories. For example, neither of these views give a hint that `net/internal/socktest` exists:\r\n\r\n*   [/pkg/](http://tip.golang.org/pkg/)\r\n*   [/pkg/net/](http://tip.golang.org/pkg/net/)\r\n\r\nBut sometimes it's nice to be able to look at the internals of a package that you're working on. (In particular, if there are a few internal packages, it's nice to see a list.) However, godoc continues to deny the existence of `net/internal/` even when it's explicitly requested:\r\n\r\n*   [/pkg/net/internal/](http://tip.golang.org/pkg/net/internal/)\r\n\r\nInstead you must already know [exactly what you're looking for](http://tip.golang.org/pkg/net/internal/socktest/) to be able to see it.\r\n\r\nCan/should godoc be changed to show internal packages when an internal directory is explicitly requested, as in the [/pkg/net/internal/](http://tip.golang.org/pkg/net/internal/) case above?",
