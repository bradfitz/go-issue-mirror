	"body": "by **minkoo.seo**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eCurrent tutorial explains semicolon like this:\n\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\nNotice that we can group declarations of the same sort into parenthesized,\nsemicolon-separated lists if we want, as on lines 7-10 and 14-17. But it's\nnot necessary to do so; we could have said\n\n    const Space = \u0026quot; \u0026quot;\n    const Newline = \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;\n\nSemicolons aren't needed here; in fact, semicolons are unnecessary after\nany top-level declaration, although they are needed as separators within a\nparenthesized list of declarations. \n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n\nAnd this is not really easy to understand. (And it doesn't mention curly\nbraces at at all.) Instead of just explaining when they're not needed,\nplease explain when they're needed also.\n\nOne suggestion:\n\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\nSemicolons are optional for top level constructs. For example, import (Line\n7-10), var(Line 12), const(Line 14-17), func(Line 19-32) do not have\nsemicolon at the end of line 10, 12, 17 and 32. \n\nHowever, in general, semicolons are needed for constructs insides top level\nconstruct. Statements inside either parenthesis or inside curly braces need\nsemicolon.\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e",
