It also marks\nthe couple of C runtime functions mentioned as static, and it fixes the test case from\ncomment #5.\n\nHowever, I'm running into an issue that regenerating the cmd/link/testdata files on\nLinux causes the cmd/link tests to fail (even without my patch).  I want to investigate\nwhat's going on there before mailing out the above CL.\n\nLastly, although it's a pretty straight forward change, it's still rather large.  So I\nwonder if it's worth breaking into steps.  E.g., first just change ld to emit both\n\"text\" and \"runtime.text\", then switch package runtime to use the \"runtime.*\" symbols,\nthen stop defining the old symbols.\u003c/pre\u003e",
