And immediately I though: \"I guess `append()` will be clever enough to avoid the copy and just do a re-slice (extend)\". I checked, and it turns out it isn't. Which was a bit surprising. *Especially* considering that the cost of detecting the (uncommon) special case turns out to be negligible. I think (and this is a judgement call) that doing \"the right thing\" in this case justifies the (almost negligible) cost. \r\n",
