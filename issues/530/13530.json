	"body": "Context: https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/2\r\n\r\nI just decided to look through the Go tour to see how it explains named types and assignability.  As far as I can tell, the only explanation is the parenthetical sentence \"And a `type` declaration does what you'd expect.\"\r\n\r\nBased on user questions like issue #13529, I suspect that `type` declarations do *not* necessarily do what users expect, and perhaps it's worth elaborating on this point somehow.",
