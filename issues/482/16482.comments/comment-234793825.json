	"body": "The first use of 'variable' is probably misleading but correct. It's a technical term that appears often in the spec, for example, to avoid other jargon like C's l-value. In that use, a variable can be thought of as something addressable, so v is a variable and a[i] is a variable buf f() is not because you cannot write f() as the target of an assignment (f() = 2 is not legal). This is subtle.\r\n\r\nThere were discussions about this terminology when writing all the documentation.\r\n\r\nThat use of the term variable should probably be avoided in introductory material. Instead, variable here should mean something declared with var or :=, the more commonly understood simpler definition.",
