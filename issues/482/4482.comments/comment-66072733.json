If the composite\nliteral is already parenthesized (for index expressions it's brackets, for the function\ncall example above it's the braces of the function), then the braces of the composite\nliteral cannot be confused with those  introducing the block of statements.\n\nI think it's pretty clear. Putting this on low-priority - perhaps we'll find a better\nphrasing at some point.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-someday**, removed **priority-triage**, **go1.1**._\n\n_Owner changed to @griesemer._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
