	"body": "The specs might be missing a piece of information(?).\r\n\r\nIn [Conversions](http://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Conversions):\r\n\u003e A constant value x can be converted to type T in any of these cases:\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e - x is representable by a value of type T.\r\n\u003e - x is a floating-point constant, T is a floating-point type, and x is representable by a value of type T after rounding using IEEE 754 round-to-even rules, but with an IEEE -0.0 further rounded to an unsigned 0.0. The constant T(x) is the rounded value.\r\n\u003e - x is an integer constant and T is a string type. The same rule as for non-constant x applies in this case.\r\n\r\nThe compiler [accepts](http://play.golang.org/p/dWk9Bsaj5M) conversions like `[]byte(\"foo\")`. The converted expression in this case *is* a 'constant value', but it's none of the above quoted legal cases.\r\n\r\nFTR: Later on the section says:\r\n\r\n\u003e A non-constant value x can be converted to type T in any of these cases:\r\n\u003e ...\r\n\u003e  - x is a string and T is a slice of bytes or runes.\r\n\r\nHowever, `\"foo\"` is not a 'non-constant value'.",
