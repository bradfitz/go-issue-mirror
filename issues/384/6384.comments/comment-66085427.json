So you are better off\narranging to encode into int64 (or use UseNumber).\n\nWe could possibly print the floating point integers below 2^53 using %.0f instead of %g.\n\nThis won't happen for Go 1.2. It needs more thought.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **go1.3maybe**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
