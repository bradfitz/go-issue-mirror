	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhen a permanent redirect occurs, calling code should have a way to get notified of this\nso that it can update the URL which is specified in some database. For example, a\ncrawler which receives a permanent redirect should not access the original URL on future\noccasions; it should use the new URL specified in the redirect, but only if that\nredirect is permanent.\n\nnet/http provides no easy way to obtain this information.\n\nCheckRedirect is not suitable since it does not provide access to the Response\nindicating the new Location, so the status code of that response cannot be polled to\ndetermine whether it is a permanent redirect.\n\nOne way of solving this would be to add a PermanentURL field to Response. This would\ncontain the URL of the latest consecutive permanent redirect target. In the following\ncase:\n\nOriginal URL -[Permanent Redirect To]-\u0026gt; Second URL -[Permanent Redirect To]-\u0026gt;\nThird URL -[Temporary Redirect To]-\u0026gt; Fourth URL -[Permanent Redirect To]-\u0026gt; Fifth\nURL.\n\nPermanentURL would contain the third URL.\n\nThis is an imperfect solution because it does not allow Permanent Redirects to be\nrecorded in situations where the redirect target is inaccessible and results in an error\nand not a Response. Though it could be argued that that might be a feature as it causes\npotentially erroneous Permanent Redirects to be ignored.\u003c/pre\u003e",
