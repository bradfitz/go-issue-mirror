The \"syscall, locked to thread\" is normal for a signal that occurs during a cgo call.  Closing because there is no obvious Go problem.  The fact that it works on other systems does not mean that it works on Mac OS.  If you are convinced there is a Go problem, please tell us precisely how we can reproduce the problem ourselves.",
