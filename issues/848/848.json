	"body": "by **bellermike**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Check out go source onto an NFS-mounted file system\n2. Build in the normal manner\n3. TestChtimes will fail with \u0026quot;Atime_ns didn't go backwards...\u0026quot;\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nTestChtimes should be able to move the time of a file back one second, but due to\nartifacts in caching of some meta-data on NFS servers, this test may fail.\n\nNote: When I move the source to a direct-attach disk the build goes fine.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nGOOS=linux\nGOARCH=amd64\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\na85ad0a64015+ release.2010-05-27/release\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThis may not occur in all NFS setups.  But I have provided a patch which fixes the\nproblem for my NFS setup, and does not seem to cause a problem for building on disk.  It\nreally just amounts to reopening/closing the file upon which Chtimes (really utimes) was\nperformed, so that NFS registers the change in meta data.  Again the patch (which is\ntiny) has only been tested in my environment. YMMV.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/848/0/os_test.patch\"\u003eos_test.patch\u003c/a\u003e (474 bytes)",
