In practice, because the sleep is so long, the two likely scenarios are:\r\n\r\n- say(\"world\") completing before say(\"hello\"), in which case you get 10 lines, or\r\n- say(\"hello\") completing before the final loop of say(\"world\"), in which case you get 9 lines.\r\n\r\n(On a machine starved for CPU you could see fewer \"world\" lines, but you would have to construct such a case.)",
