I didn't see any on a quick\nglance.\nThis issue is for tracking work toward being able to call Go from C programs (perhaps\nlinked into the program already, perhaps as a dynload .so file).\n\nElias Naur has done some good work getting the raw technical details of things like\nlarge-model, position-independent code working.\n\nThe biggest step that remains is defining what it means to enter a Go program. Do we use\nthe usual 'run main.init+main.main' that we use for standalone binaries? Do we use\nsomething else? Is os.Args defined? And so on.\n\nI expect this to happen after Go 1.1.\u003c/pre\u003e",
