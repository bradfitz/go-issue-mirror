They refer\nto /etc/passwd, etc.  Still it can't hurt to use TempDir.  But I do want to point out\nthat, /tmp is already used directly here:\n\u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/os/os_test.go?r=release#388\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/os/os_test.go?r=release#388\u003c/a\u003e  So if\nsomeone wants to make that change it would make sense to make it in both places.  In any\ncase my original patch should fix the problem without adding any new non-portability.\u003c/pre\u003e",
