	"body": "pprof currently only reports heap-allocated memory. However, pprof is meant to help with debugging memory footprint and sometimes an application's memory footprint comes from non-heap sources, such as stacks or GC memory (the latter usually indicates a bug such as #15319, but it's currently hard to track down such bugs).\r\n\r\nHence, pprof should report the other sources of memory footprint somehow, such as showing them as isolated boxes or simply showing them in the info box. This information is already recorded in profiles, though it's in \"comments\".",
