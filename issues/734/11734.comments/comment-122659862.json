They seem to be adding flexibility in the named color spec \r\n\r\n- **X11: ** The official reference for X11 colors in W3 docs seems to be Wikipedia, so that's probably not a good idea :-) \r\n\r\nI'd say that basing generation of named colors on the draft CSS4 spec will likely give us future compatibility for many years as the draft gets worked on and published. If we want to be strictly published standards driven, then we should follow SVG1.1 ",
