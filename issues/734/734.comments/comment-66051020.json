Your comment about OldISO8601 makes me\nwonder if ISO8601 \nshould be dropped as well.  It suggests that time.Parse(time.ISO8601, value) will\nunderstand any ISO 8601 date, \nwhich just isn't true.  Also, removing it means that code that depended on it will fail\nto compile, preventing any \nsort of accidental breakage from the format change.\n\nI've made these changes to my local copy.  I'll submit a CL for review tomorrow, if\nyou'd like.\u003c/pre\u003e",
