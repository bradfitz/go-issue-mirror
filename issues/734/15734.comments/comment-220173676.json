	"body": "\u003e How would the compiler signal to cmd/go that it is done emitting export data?\r\n\r\nA relatively simple (but local-only) way would be:\r\n\r\n  1. Each time cmd/go execs cmd/compile, it creates a new os.Pipe, passes the writing end as one of cmd/compile's ExtraFiles, along with a command line flag like -signalexportdata.\r\n  2. In cmd/compile, if we see -signalexportdata, we close the pipe FD after writing out export data to disk.\r\n  3. Back in cmd/go, when we see the pipe has been closed, we can assume export data is written out.\r\n\r\nI also suspect you don't actually need separate export data file functionality for this.  Since the export data is at the beginning of the .a file, we can just write a partial .a file, signal cmd/go, and then finish writing later.",
