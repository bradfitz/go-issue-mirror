And then AllocsPerRun never\nreported even that.\nZero-sized allocations has never been reported (while most of C mallocs would consider\nthat as an allocation).\nSometimes it counted mallocgc twice (when settype inside wanted to allocate memory).\nOther things like deferproc can be counted as well. But if/when we move some of defers\nto stack, this implementation detail will change again.\nThings can become more complicated when we have bump the pointer allocator with inlines\nfast path.\n\nIt does not seem to me that there is strong enough notion of a \"user allocation\" that we\ncan preserve over time. Runtime reports what *it* thinks is an allocation.\n\nIf we want to do checking of allocs as a QoI measure we can check that number of\nallocations per N interations fits into a permissible range.\u003c/pre\u003e",
