It will trigger any leak detection monitoring out there, basically\nnumber of objects in heap grows infinitely.\n\nI am still not convinced that we need to fix anything here. MemStats are not about user\nprogram as written, it's about what happens in runtime (e.g. we do not count new(T) that\nis demoted to stack). For runtime these allocations are not allocations. Just as number\nof allocations can fluctuate after recompilation due to changes in escaping, it can\nchange from iteration to iteration if execution environment manages to avoid some\nallocations on some iterations.\n\nWe do have the same effect due to defer caching, we do have the same effect in chan\noperations and mutexes due to sudog caching, we do have the same effect in any package\nthat uses caching.\u003c/pre\u003e",
