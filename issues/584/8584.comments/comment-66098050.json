I\nguess you (Alan) or Robert will have an easier time.\n\nAn alternative implementation that I had in mind (which would also fix this bug) is\nsimply to construct a selectionSet and look up the field or method therein.  It's\nslower, but I don't think that's important:  Clients that want speed should use a\nSelectionSetCache, which I expect gives better performance when there are multiple\nqueries on the same type (which I think is the case for performance-critical\napplications).  The main benefit is removing lookupFieldOrMethod, which is a near\nduplicate of newSelectionSet/NewMethodSet.  Of course, this fix depends on\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/66730052/\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/66730052/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
