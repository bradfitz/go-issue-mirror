But the problem remains, because the MEM_RESET page still\nremains part of \"committed\" memory. \"committed\" memory is a finite resource. From the\ntop of my head, I cannot tell you how amount of \"committed\" memory affects Windows\nmemory manager, but I suspect it does.\n\nWhat would need to change in go runtime for us to be able to de-committ memory?\n\nI suspect we won't be able to de-committ memory, we should use MEM_RESET then. I am\nhappy to do it. But it is low on my todo list.\n\nAlex\n\nPS: Why VirtualAllocEx, not VirtualAlloc?\n\nPSS: I bleive MEM_RESET is available on every Windows OS. Even on w2k. \"MEM_RESET is\nsupported starting from Windows 8\" - do you have a reference to that?\u003c/pre\u003e",
