And that's how\nit should work imo, no need for forking gdb and such.\n\nAs for forking gdb, please consider that you can do a number of things with gdb like\nremote debugging, IDE integration via gdb/mi which I'm sure are not going to be on top\nof the priority list. It also means that those features will be denied to the users\nusing a 'new go debugger'.\n\nAnd as a last thing, you can use gdb with binaries generated by bunch of other\nprogramming language but if every programming language would roll its own debugger it\nwould be a messy situation imho.\n\nI do however support adding to the docs that gdb support is currently not optimal.\n\nKind regards\u003c/pre\u003e",
