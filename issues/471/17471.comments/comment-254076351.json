I'm not sure why yet.\r\n\r\nAh, `methodValueCall` is genuinely a zero argument function (and d.siz is in fact 0, so the defer \"frame\" is empty). It gets the `*methodValue` that `getArgInfo` is looking for from its context register. `getArgInfo` can find this on the stack not because the caller put it there but because `methodValueCall` is hand-written to put its context register at 0(SP) (and naturally so, since it's about to pass it as the argument to `reflect.callMethod`). This means, if we're not actually in a call to `methodValueCall`, `getArgInfo` isn't going to find this on the stack.",
