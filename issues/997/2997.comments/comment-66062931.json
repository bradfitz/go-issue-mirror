That was true even before I manually added the\nGoogle one.\n\nIn order to try with IE, I had to re-enable IE9 in \"Turn Windows Features on or off\"\ndialog.  I received no warning from your link which is expected since I had added the\ncertificate manually.  I then deleted the certificate I added (via Microsoft Management\nConsole) and IE still accepted the HTTPS connection to Google Code.  Using \"go get\" also\nworked and continues to work even though I have again turned IE off.  Reboots throughout\nof course.  In short, I can't reproduce the problem.\n\nI never tried Alex's initial suggestion through the mailing list, which is what you just\nsuggested: try through IE and see what it says (and then try to 'go get' right after if\nsuccessful).  I didn't try because I had IE disabled and didn't want to go through a\nreboot right then.  Is it possible that IE needs to vet the certificate through the\nchain?  I tried clearing IE's certificate cache (it had google listed as verified\nthrough Equifax) but that also had no effect.\n\nThe final bit of info I can add is that this is a fresh install of Windows 7, although I\nhad already updated to SP1 and almost every security update.\u003c/pre\u003e",
