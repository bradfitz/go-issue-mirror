The binary that blocks\nin _disable_asynccancel() is still calling rt_sigaction() to register go's signal\nhandler for SIGRTMIN. So I don't understand the cause of the different behaviour (strace\nreports the thread just keeps trying to call futex() which fails with EAGAIN).\n\nI have now properly rebuilt/installed runtime after clearing signal 32's flags, and\npthread_cancel works as expected.\n\nSimilar to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/3871\"\u003eissue #3871\u003c/a\u003e, but this signal doesn't need to be propagated to all threads at\nleast. NPTL pthreads only mentions the first two realtime signals as reserved so\nhopefully that's the end of it!\u003c/pre\u003e",
