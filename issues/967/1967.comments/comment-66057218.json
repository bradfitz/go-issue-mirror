(a download manager that needs to be able to pause\n\u0026 resume later, presumably with a Range request)\n\nWe should have some answer for this.\n\nActually I just thought of one:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://tip.goneat.org/pkg/http/#Transport\"\u003ehttp://tip.goneat.org/pkg/http/#Transport\u003c/a\u003e -- I added an optional Transport.Dial awhile\nback for SOCKS proxy dialers.
