This\nmeans that if the user wants the connection to close, or if the server requests it via\n\"Connection: close\", the connection will not be closed.\n\nTo see what I mean, look at net/http/transport.go, line 568, and look at how the code\nproceeds with alive set to false. Concerning the OP's issue, I would say that (without\nactually testing it) the connection does not close even if you read to EOF.\n\nI have attached a patch which should resolve the issue.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1967/9/issue1967.patch\"\u003eissue1967.patch\u003c/a\u003e (487 bytes)",
