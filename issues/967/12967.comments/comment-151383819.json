	"body": "Does your first solution mean that the stacks would be shrunk during a STW phase, or that they would not be shrunk at all?\r\n\r\nMost of the goroutines in the application I described are blocked on channel operations nearly all the time. The goroutines occasionally get a message on their channel that makes them call a function with a large stack requirement (and which returns quickly).\r\n\r\nLocking all goroutines that are attempting to communicate on a channel, as described in the second solution, would make \"quit\" channels more expensive if shared across many goroutines. Stack shrinking on any one of the participating goroutines would delay all of the others.\r\n\r\nThe third solution seems easy to reason about, and sounds like it will have predictable performance.",
