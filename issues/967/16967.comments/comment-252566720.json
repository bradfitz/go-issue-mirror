The fix is to hardcode a namespace into the gomobile tool and then recompile. Thats really a temp hack.. \r\n\r\n@eliasnaur\r\nCould someone on the gomobile team think about fixing this obvious tooling bug ?\r\nWhat might be best is a command line flag for compiling for ios ? This would then get ride of the hardcoded constant in the common code as shown at the https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12660\r\n\r\n\r\n",
