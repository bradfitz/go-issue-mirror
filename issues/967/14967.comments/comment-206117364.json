The Solaris Studio compilers do include references to the symbols in their dwarf output.\r\n\r\nI did a search through the Solaris headers to see how many things use symbol renaming, and it's more than a few -- (262 instances), so we should probably open a separate bug and add support for this somehow.  The mygetgrnam_r route will work for the moment for this particular case.\r\n\r\nThe symbol renaming is used to guarantee backwards compatibility for older source code and older programs.\r\n",
