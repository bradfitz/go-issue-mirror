Javascript and Go are very different languages that work in very different ways.  If you can identify specific reasons why Go is slower, then perhaps we can improve it.\r\n\r\nThis is a case where gccgo is likely to generate faster code than the gc compiler.  On my laptop the code generated by gccgo -O2 is 6% faster.  Both print 7295372 at the end.  Of course, that is much less than the difference you report between Go and Javascript.  I admit to being puzzled by how Javascript can be so much faster.  It would be interesting to find out what the Javascript JIT turns the inner loop into.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm going to close this issue as there is nothing useful we can do to fix it.",
