We were able to prove that when the corruption happened, the correct pointer address had changed in Go-land.\r\n\r\n~~Also, on further thought, I actually think requiring that C libraries don't save any Go pointers is probably a fine rule, even given the concerns about passing Go-allocated byte-slices to C.~~ Update: on even further thought, I think not being able to remember Go pointers in C makes many callback-based C libraries unusable.",
