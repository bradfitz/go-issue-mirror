Usage of optional builtin types as struct fields and func parameters are cumbersome\nleading to hard to maintain incompatible ad hoc solutions in packages (see mentioned\nticket and blog post)\n\n2. There is currently no way to have a type that is an interface and is satisfied by a\nbuiltin without having to create wrapper types that are also ad hoc, package specific\nand cumbersome.\n\nThe proposal offers a solution to both problems.\u003c/pre\u003e",
