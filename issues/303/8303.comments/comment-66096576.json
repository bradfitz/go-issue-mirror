I believe that you are asking for\nsome kind of interface for builtin types, the example you give is bool. But the reason\nfor this request is to express a third case, true, false and not set.\n\nHow is your proposal materially better than the existing solutions of using a *bool.\nThis is what you would get, the ability to set this boolean interface type to nil, if I\nunderstand your proposal.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **languagechange**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
