Other than go tool there are other tools that rely on vendor behavior such as gocode (autocompletion) and goimports. They normally are executed by an IDE/editor in the background and mechanism to change their arguments on per project basis doesn't always exist.\r\n\r\nAdditionally if `golibs` in your example has some private vendored dependecies `-novendor` flag simply won't work. And BTW the standard library in Go 1.7 has vendored dependencies in GOROOT. So some packages (e.g. `net/http`) from the stanrdard library cannot be built without vendoring support.\r\n\r\nFinally with many packages in vendor folder and many projects with different versions of vendored dependencies it is almost impossible to ensure that GOPATH has the correct versions when vendoring is disabled.\r\n\r\nFor experiments you can rename `vendor` to `_vendor` or just hack in `vendor/golibs` and move the changes manually to the golibs project later.\r\n\r\n@rhedile \r\n\r\nWould \"no vendor directories in the source control\" rule will satisfy the compiance? It is probably easier to enforce than making sure that build scripts turn off vendoring support.",
