	"body": "Thanks for all the info. It's clear to me now. @kostya-sh: \"the standard library in Go 1.7 has vendored dependencies in GOROOT\" - this is key.\r\n\r\nSo, could you please treat this as a request for documentation? I suggest here: https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Vendor_Directories\r\n\r\n\u003e In Go 1.5, as an experiment, setting the environment variable GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1 enabled these features. As of Go 1.6 they are on by default. To turn them off, set GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=0. In Go 1.7, the environment variable will stop having any effect.\r\n\r\nAn extra sentence or 2 would suffice. Could it be as follows please, including a recommended name (to encourage consistency in 3rd party tooling)?\r\n\r\n\u003e To temporarily disable a vendor folder, simply rename it. It is recommended to use a standard name such as `_novendor`, and to ignore it from your SCM\r\n\r\nThanks again. Note: renaming issue to reflect this comment.",
