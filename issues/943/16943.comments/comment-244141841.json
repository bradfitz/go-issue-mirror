At least optimizations are inherently lossy about source information like line numbers, and users seem to understand/appreciate that.\r\n\r\nAlso, since the current line numbering is often so ad hoc, I don't think there's any particular rush to implement/guarantee these rules.  My goal with this issue is more to agree on a long-term ideal to strive towards.\r\n\r\n\u003e One small data point I'd like to see is binary size before/after. The pclntab is the single largest component of binaries, and its size is tied directly to line-numbering decisions in the compiler. I don't expect much change, but it'd be good to keep an eye on it.\r\n\r\nAck, I don't expect much change either, but I'll keep an eye out.",
