Then do a pass at\n\u003e the end that assigns those ops a line numbers equal to the line number of\n\u003e the nearest line-number-specified instruction.\n\n\nI think that's a good approach.  There is no perfect answer for many\ninstructions, even for the high-level representation in\ngolang.org/x/tools/go/ssa, and the compiler's low-level SSA with\noptimizations will have even more operations that aren't exactly associated\nwith a given piece of syntax.  Control flow branches in particular are hard\nto correlate with syntax.  Using the correct answer when you have it and\nthe \"nearest\" answer when you don't will result in smaller line number\ntables if they use any kind of run-length encoding.\n",
