For most of these, I think we should instead back off and just try running it for longer if we get an empty profile. We've seen flakes all over the profiling tests and I suspect some of them are just because we're running a bunch of other package tests in parallel and the profile test genuinely doesn't get enough CPU time to get samples.",
