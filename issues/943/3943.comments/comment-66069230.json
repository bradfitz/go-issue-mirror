At the\nvery least, it should exit early if the source doesn't look like a text file at all.\n\nIn fact the current implementation does exit early if there are errors parsing the\npackage clause, but for binary files even getting past that clause causes a lot of\nerrors (invalid encoding of the source). The following CL fixes this problem:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/6458115\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/6458115\u003c/a\u003e\n\nLeaving this issue open for now.\u003c/pre\u003e",
