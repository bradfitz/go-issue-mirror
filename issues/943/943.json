What do you see instead?\nThis optimization causes the 5g toolchain to blow up with a linker error much later on:\n??none??: /Users/kaib/go/pkg/linux_arm/strconv.a: failed to load: type.os.Error\n\nhere is what is known about the bug\n- only happens when linking against an .a file created with gopack\n- while trying to create a smaller repro the bug seemed very fickle and would disappear\nwhen seemingly random pieces of code were removed.\n- valgrind runs didn't turn up any smoking guns\n\ngiven it was challenging to produce focused repro (as opposed to compiling the whole\nstandard library) i'm giving up on the bug until we have done a full run to ensure all\nthe bugfixes in 6g/8g are ported to 5g.\u003c/pre\u003e",
