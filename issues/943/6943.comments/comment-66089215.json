I just read\nyour friend's blog (in Japanese), it happens on OS X with Go 1.2, and now see a few bugs\nin the code. For example, \n\nres, err := client.Do(proxyRequest)\nif err != nil {\n        log.Printf(\"HTTP Request Error: %s\\n\", err)\n}\nresponse, err := NewResponse(backend, res, elapsed) // this guy may touch a nil pointer\n\n\u003e go doesn't return response.\n\nI believe that Go standard library reports resource exhaustion but the code ignores and\ntries to continue a chicken race, in that case ulimit or launchctl would be a solution.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Retracted**._",
