If it is recent enough (few years old), it\nshould work.\n\nYou are referring to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/6833\"\u003eissue #6833\u003c/a\u003e, but it is already fixed.\n\nAlso you don't need MinGW to use Go. Our binary distro does not contain MinGW. It is\nonly required, if you use cgo or contribute to Go project. If that is the case, then you\nshould be able to figure out (or ask for help) how and what to install.\n\nI don't grant or deny access to \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/WindowsBuild\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/WindowsBuild\u003c/a\u003e.\nPerhaps others will help you with that.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
