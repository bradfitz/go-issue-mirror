Android at least has more than one notion of fullscreen, so bool may not be enough.\r\n\r\nIt may also be worth considering an options struct, and deciding whether or not that should be passed as a method to the App object. That is:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype AppOptions struct {\r\n    HideTitleBar bool // set to true is traditional android fullscreen\r\n    Fullscreen bool // android immersive mode, implies HideTitleBar?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype App interface {\r\n    ...\r\n    SetOptions(o Options)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could also hold EGL options, if we can find any suitable portable subset of those (I suspect we cannot).",
