Even simpler is:\n\nfunc indexHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tif r.URL.Path != \"/\" {\n\t\thttp.NotFound(w, r)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n        ....\n}\n\nWhat concerns me is that serving that page at all endpoints is a bug\nthat was latent in my program.  I'd like to help others not have that\nbug.\n\nI still like the idea of \"/\" including all paths and \"\" including the\nroot only, similar to the trailing slash in \"/foo/\" vs. \"/foo\".  The\nother suggestions expand the API more than I think is justified.\u003c/pre\u003e",
