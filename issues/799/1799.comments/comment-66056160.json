What is your output for the command awk --version?\n\nI suspect that the problem is related to the fact that some Go Windows port programmers\nuse obsolete versions of the Windows operating system and/or the MSYS/MinGW toolchain.\nThe flagship linux/darwin Go implementation expects that reasonably current software\nversions are used.\u003c/pre\u003e",
