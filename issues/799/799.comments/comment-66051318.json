If no one does anything about\nthis part, I can't complain too much.\n\nThe internal compiler error definitely seems like a bug to me, though.\n\nAlso note that string literals are not typed. I can say:\n\ntype S string\nvar s S = \"A string\"\n\nIf string literals were typed, that would fail to compile. I think it's inconsistent\nthat I get a somewhat reasonable value for the size of a string literal, but not for\na numeric literal.\u003c/pre\u003e",
