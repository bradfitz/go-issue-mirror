	"body": "by **robryk**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eSome of *os.File's methods return an error when called on a nil pointer. For example,\nthe following do so: Read, ReadAt, Write, WriteAt. These methods explicitely check for a\nnil pointer.\n\nSome other panic when they are called on a nil pointer. For instance: Name, Close, Seek.\n\nThe documentation doesn't say anything about this case. It might be nice to do the same\nthing for all methods, but I'm not sure if the compatibility promises don't prevent any\nchange there.\n\nThe behaviour was mentioned in:\n\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/104862366695495126200/posts/LE5tfxKaUS4\"\u003ehttps://plus.google.com/u/0/104862366695495126200/posts/LE5tfxKaUS4\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
