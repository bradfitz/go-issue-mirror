So we can piggyback on the old N==1 phase to discover if there are subbenchmarks without changing the processing flow.\r\n\r\nSo overall, using the current N==1 as the \"probe\" phase is probably better. Moreover, to do setup once, a user can use a flag, or even use subtests:\r\n```go\r\nfunc BenchmarkFoo(b *B) {\r\n    // setup\r\n   b.Run(b *B) {\r\n      // doBench\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```",
