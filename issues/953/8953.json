	"body": "by **burke@libbey.me**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003esignal.Notify accepts SIGCONT as a parameter, but SIGCONT is never actually delivered to\nthe channel. I was able to register SIGCONT handler with cgo, but couldn't find any way\nfrom Go.\n\nTested on:\n\n* go version go1.3.1 darwin/amd64\n* go version go1.3.3 linux/amd64\n\nWith the following source, I would expect the program to terminate immediately; however,\nit hangs indefinitely. You can change SIGCONT into nearly any other signal to verify.\nSIGTSTP has the same issue.\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\u0026quot;os\u0026quot;\n\t\u0026quot;os/signal\u0026quot;\n\t\u0026quot;syscall\u0026quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tch := make(chan os.Signal)\n\tsignal.Notify(ch, syscall.SIGCONT)\n\tsyscall.Kill(0, syscall.SIGCONT)\n\t\u0026lt;-ch\n}\u003c/pre\u003e",
