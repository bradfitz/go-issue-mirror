	"body": "by **jdnurmi@qwe.cc**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Create a '*' CN cert in xca (or other toolkit with similar cert behaviour);  \n2. Export to DER.\n3. Parse the cert with the x.509 toolkit\n4. Print the subject.CommonName\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nCommonName: \u0026quot;*\u0026quot;\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nCommonName: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nLinux\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n164ef168486b+\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nIt seems that the asn1 parser special-cases both IA5String and GeneralString cases, but\nnot the T61Strings.  On the assumption that there are no other implications, I've\nattached a patch that simply allows the string to continue.\n\n*NB* I'm guessing a teletex string shouldn't actually have non digit/#/* entries, but\nI've not reviewed x.509 in a while.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1953/0/asn1.patch\"\u003easn1.patch\u003c/a\u003e (519 bytes)",
