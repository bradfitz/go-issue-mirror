It raise \"OSError: image file is truncated (53 bytes not processed)\" when I use python to download a jpeg file, the binary data can be save to file with ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES=True, but the truncated pixel will set to black. with go, all pixel process well and not truncate but it will raise \"invalid JPEG format: short Huffman data\" when decode it.  the jpeg show full in safari but truncated in chrome.  maybe go need truncate the jpeg as python does",
