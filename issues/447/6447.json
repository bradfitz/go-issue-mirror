	"body": "by **seanalexprice**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eGo Version: go1.1.2 windows/amd64\nWindows 8\n\nWhen I attempt run/build the project, the compiler states that a function is missing a\nreturn at the first line of file \u0026quot;models/hand.go\u0026quot;.  But the return is actually\nmissing at the end of \u0026quot;models/game.go\u0026quot;.\n\nThis was pretty easy to spot in my larger project because I just figured it would\nlogically be found in the file preceding it.  What's interesting is if I place a new\nline in at the bottom of \u0026quot;models/game.go\u0026quot;, it will correctly identify the file\nand line number for the missing return.\n\nThe attached project is broken down to simply reproduce the problem.\n\nCompiler message:\n\u0026quot;hand.go:1: missing return at end of function\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/6447/0/bugreport.zip\"\u003ebugreport.zip\u003c/a\u003e (2404 bytes)",
