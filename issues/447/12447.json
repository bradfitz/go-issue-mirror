	"body": "Many browsers now support schemeless URLs in the Location headers and also it is allowed in the draft HTTP/1.1 specification (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4831741/can-i-change-all-my-http-links-to-just#comment25926312_4831741), but Go standard library lacks support for them.\r\n\r\nI've made a patch to implement schemeless URLs support in `net/http::Redirect()`. Since `net/url::Parse()` correctly handles schemeless URL's, I've just added an extra condition to verify URL's Host part in the absoulute/relative check in the `Redirect()` function.\r\n\r\nAlso I've moved `oldpath` variable initialization inside the block of code where it is used.
