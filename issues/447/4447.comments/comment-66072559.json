It mentions that it doesn't take physical memory from other\nprocesses. I feel like the big VSIZE affects whether linux will allow the fork or not.\n\nI'm rewriting a program from C to Go, and I noticed that at around a VSIZE=2GB and\nRSS=600MB, fork/exec fails in the go version of the program. In the C version, which\ndoesn't have such a big VSIZE, that doesn't happen.\n\nThe machine has 4GB of RAM, no swap, and I use go 1.0.3.\n\nMay this issue be related to what I see?\u003c/pre\u003e",
