	"body": "by **mrunalp**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWe are working on adding User Namespace support to docker/libcontainer, but running into\nan issue where there is no opportunity to write UID/GID Mappings to a child process\nafter fork/exec leading to the child process losing capabilities.\n\nHere is a proof-of-concept patch that will allow Go to support User Namespaces easily.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/mrunalp/7334e74a01b9a10e8546\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/mrunalp/7334e74a01b9a10e8546\u003c/a\u003e\n\nHere is some sample code that will exercise the code above.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/mrunalp/4365565f94e9c9fd737c\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/mrunalp/4365565f94e9c9fd737c\u003c/a\u003e\n\nHere is sample output from invoking the test program above.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/mrunalp/b684fdce11f2175b6d4d\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/mrunalp/b684fdce11f2175b6d4d\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI will be glad to clean up this patch to get this merged into Go.\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
