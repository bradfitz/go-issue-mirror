I tried to reproduce this today,\nconnecting to 8.8.4.4 and to 74.125.19.99, and both address hung during\nthe TCP connect, both on 32-bit and 64-bit systems.  It's really up to\nthe TCP stack to decide whether to fail quickly or to take a long time,\nso it's hard to believe that 32- or 64-bit would matter.\n\nMarking as invalid since I cannot reproduce this.\n\nIf you can still reproduce this on your system, please run the programs\nunder strace -f -o trace.out and attach traces for both 32-bit and 64-bit\nexecution, so we can see what the system calls are doing.\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Invalid**._",
