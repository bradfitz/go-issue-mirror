We run all our development machines with go1.4 in home that bootstraps latest go release.  We have always run that way because prepackaged go versions in different OS' are always a mishmash of versions and frankly don't always work right (just this morning a new hire found out Debian is on Go 1.3 the hard way).  When run this way multiuser machines can run whatever go version a user needs without stepping on some system default.  We also use this to test code with multiple versions of go by simply flipping GOPATH.  I truly appreciate the fact that go let's us do that easily.  FWIW.",
