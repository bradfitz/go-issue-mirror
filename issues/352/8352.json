The effect is that you may end up with really hard to debug code\nbecause you mistakenly named a variable the same as an import, and hundreds of lines\nlater, you find that import no longer exists in that scope.\n\nI would love if the above play.golang would compile with an error saying shadowing of an\nimport is not permitted, or at least warning me where it happened.\n\nUnless... shadowing an import is a feature? I mean, it allows you to monkeypatch an\nimport, for example: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/YoRCEYAtAu\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/YoRCEYAtAu\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThoughts?\u003c/pre\u003e",
