But it seems unlikely to come up regularly. Most likely, the program will break in a way apparent to the user and they can modify their command line to read\r\n--unknown=--known foo\r\nWe could trigger that behavior based on an option set on the FlagSet object.\r\n\r\nWhat about the other half of my proposal? It seems to me at least that flagSet.Arg() should return the first unknown argument instead of only subsequent arguments.",
