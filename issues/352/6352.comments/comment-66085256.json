The case that is not handled is when the first\ncharacter of the field is a quote, i.e., |\"What?\" - he said.|. In this case the second\nquote is taken to be a bare quote and the function will suck in all characters until\n(many lines later), it finds another quote.\n\nAttached is a small patch that fixes this problem (only) when LazyQuotes is set to true.\nAfter reading a quote in the middle of a field, if the next character isn't a Comma or\nNewline, it starts processing it as a normal field (ignoring any more quotes). The quote\nread in the middle is output to the field as a normal character.\n\nIt would be desirable to rewrite the buffer at this point to include the initial quote\nbut the attached fix does not do that, i.e., |\"What?\" he said| will be returned as\n|What?\" he said|\n\nHTH\nSudhir\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/6352/13/diff.out\"\u003ediff.out\u003c/a\u003e (807 bytes)",
