	"body": "I haven't tested this, but I suspect it is true: if you build a Go library using -buildmode=c-archive or c-shared, and call the Go library from a C program, and the Go library tries to use runtime/pprof.StartCPUProfile, I expect it won't work.  The problem is that Go will not have installed the SIGPROF signal handler.",
