	"body": "If the `ALL_PROXY` environment variable is set to a non-SOCKS address it results in the `proxy: unknown scheme: http` when it instead should ignore it.\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo1.6.3 via docker\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nwindows/amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nHave a http `ALL_PROXY` environment variable set and try to run Docker Toolbox, e.g. `docker run hello-world`\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nDocker should work fine, Go should ignore non-SOCKS `ALL_PROXY` environment variable\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nDocker doesn't work because non-SOCKS `ALL_PROXY` environment variable is not ignored. The error can be traced back to https://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/proxy/proxy.go#L93.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Run `unset ALL_PROXY` when you get error.\r\n",
