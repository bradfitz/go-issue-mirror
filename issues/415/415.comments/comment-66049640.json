What makes a literal \"basic\"?  The CL assumes this means an \ninteger, floating-point, character, or string literal.  Is this meant to distinguish \nfrom a composite or function literal (which are covered by the third bullet in the \nsemicolons section)?\n\nBefore this change, the top level was grammatically special and had a form of \nsemicolon insertion hard-coded into the grammar rules.  I wanted to confirm my \nunderstanding that the top level is now no different from any other code and does not \nneed to be parsed or indented specially.\u003c/pre\u003e",
