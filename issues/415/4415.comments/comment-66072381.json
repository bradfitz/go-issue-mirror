There are several\ninstances where gc does not check the return from malloc, so instead of resulting in an\n\"out of memory\" failure, we've ended up faulting. There are also additional unchecked\nmallocs throughout src/cmd and src/libmach.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: removed **os-openbsd**._",
