	"body": "@kardianos I understand we can implement a workaround like that (for example, the pq NullTime type works in a similar fashion) but it's not ideal: if I add the NULL property you are suggesting then I have to write custom JSON Marshal and Unmarshal functions or my JSON output to the client will be some type of empty JSON object instead of a JavaScript null.  This can be done of course but it adds unnecessary code and tends to obfuscate your application's logic, ie. when a piece of data is NULL in the datastore the most logical thing is to have corresponding nil in the application.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm missing something but what is the argument not to make this fix?\r\n\r\nThanks",
