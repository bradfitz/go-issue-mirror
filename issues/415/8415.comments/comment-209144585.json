Your code seems to go back to the case I was discussing when I reopened the issue above.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to check for whether `Kind() == Interface`.  In that case, a `nil` value won't implement `driver.Valuer` anyhow.\r\n\r\nIf the pointer is `nil`, but `driver.Valuer` is implemented on the pointer type, we should call the method.  It's fine to call a method on a `nil` pointer.  The `Value` method can decide what to do.\r\n\r\nThe only interesting case is a pointer that is `nil` for which the `Value` method is implemented on a value.  In that case we can't call the method, so we should just stick the `nil`.  That is what I was suggesting above.",
