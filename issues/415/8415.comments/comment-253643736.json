That's good, no? It helps you find your mistakes.\r\n\r\nWhen I say this bug is confusing, it's because it's long, bounces around different topics, and doesn't have a concise summary anywhere. I admit I haven't read the whole thread.\r\n\r\n@kardianos, care to summarize? Maybe there's something to do here with better error messages at least?\r\n",
