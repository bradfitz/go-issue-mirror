Neither\nlanguage tags no rendering hints.\n\nFor the first issue: I'm not a native English speaker as well, but I firmly believe\nprogrammers must know English and write documentation (which comments are part of) in\nEnglish. For the very same reason why MDs know and use Latin.\n\nMarkdown and friends: Godoc comments read _and look_ well unprocessed. I prefer to keep\nthis nice property.\u003c/pre\u003e",
