While the manpage states that obtaining the address is not\nsupported for Unix sockets, the address family doesn't seem to be set either if the\nsocket is not bound (see the attached example). This means that net.FileConn doesn't\nrecognize it as a Unix socket.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3349/5/getsockname_test.c\"\u003egetsockname_test.c\u003c/a\u003e (552 bytes)",
