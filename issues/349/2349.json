	"body": "by **chrisfarms**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI have been using http.Client with proxy connections and have noticed that a ton of\nconnections get stuck in SYN_SENT after a while. Eventually resulting in \u0026quot;too many\nopen files\u0026quot; errors which obviously causes serious problems.\n\nTo see this issue I have included a little example program [syn_stuck.go] that will open\na large number of HTTP connections via non-existant proxy, and then tell you to go check\n\u0026quot;lsof\u0026quot;. I've tried it on both OSX and Linux with same results.\n\nAfter a bit of digging I believe the issue is with net/sock.go:56 .... when an\nfd.connect() fails the socket is not closed. (patch attached). \n\nRunning syn_stuck + lsof after the patch gives the expected result.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2349/0/syn_stuck.go\"\u003esyn_stuck.go\u003c/a\u003e (1778 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2349/0/syn_stuck_fix.diff\"\u003esyn_stuck_fix.diff\u003c/a\u003e (302 bytes)",
