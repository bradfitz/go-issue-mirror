If the user passes in an IPv6\naddress (not an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address), and expect To4\nto return a non-nil address. According to your docs, it should work\nbecause the user has passed an IP address.\n\nIf you say an IPv6 address is not the \"correct\" length for To4, then\nwhat about IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses? They have the length\nof IPv6 address, but To4 can still convert them to IPv4.\n",
