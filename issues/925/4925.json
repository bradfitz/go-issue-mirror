	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIt would be nice if the encoding/gob package had some more examples as its usage is not\ncompletely clear especially for new users. See eg:\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/fRixmVKLddY/discussion\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/fRixmVKLddY/discussion\u003c/a\u003e\n\nSome specific things which I think are not obvious enough include a) when/where\nRegister( ) should be called, b) What the appropriate use of RegisterName() is, c) How\nto implement GobEncoder/GobDecoder.\n\nAlso a package-level example of how it all fits together would also be helpful.\u003c/pre\u003e",
