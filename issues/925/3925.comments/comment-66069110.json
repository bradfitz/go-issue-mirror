I don't suggest it, and certainly not before Go 1.1.\n\nMost of the time the line number is provided by the outer expression:\nthe only time this comes up is when the outer expression is on a\ndifferent line. In theory that can happen on nearly every expression\nbut in practice the number of cases that arise is much smaller. Let's\njust fix them as they come up for now.\n\nA general fix would be to add the OPAREN around every name, but that\nseems like it would waste significant memory just when we are trying\nto reduce the memory usage.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
