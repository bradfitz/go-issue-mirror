It likely was caused by your application or a library it called, but we just don't know without seeing the output that was printed on stderr. Issue #16893 will add the panic logs to the core dump, so in the future we'll be able to tell you more.\r\n\r\nClosing this issue since there isn't anything actionable we can do with this traceback.",
