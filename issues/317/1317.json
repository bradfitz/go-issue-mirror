	"body": "by **mseigneurin@aliceadsl.fr**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe http.ResonseWriter exposes a UsingTLS() method which is good, but the other info\nstored in the tls.Conn structure is not available. Could the interface be\nextended/changed to allow access to more of the TLS properties?\n\n(this is related to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/155)\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/155)\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nlinux,x86_64\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nd206790cdd7d tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI can \u0026quot;patch in\u0026quot; by creating a custom Listener that mimics the\ntls.Listener and gets the information there, but I can't figure out a\nway of propagating that info up the stack to the actual handlers\nwithout:\na) hacking in the http/server.go and adding an accessor there similar\nto the way UsingTLS() is implemented - which is not real nice I guess.\nor b) writing a custom equivalent of http.conn/http.response, which is\na lot of duplicated code.\u003c/pre\u003e",
