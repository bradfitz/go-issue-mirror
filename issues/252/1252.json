	"body": "by **broadley**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Apply 1 line diff to go-hg/test/bench/mandelbrot.c\n2. Watch runtime increase by 50%\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nI expect either a small increase in performance or at worst a small decrease.\n\nIn most languages (C, Java, C# and Gccgo) this:\n    Zi = Zr*Zi + Zr*Zi + Ci\n\nIs faster than this:\n    Zi = 2*Zr*Zi + Ci\n\nEven through there are 4 flops instead of 3.  However considering there are 9 or 10\nflops in the loop it seems very strange for this trivial change to slow down the program\nby 50%.  Seems like something is wrong.\n\nHere's the diff:\n70c70\n\u0026lt; \t\t\t\tZi = 2*Zr*Zi + Ci\n---\n\u0026gt; \t\t\t\tZi = Zr*Zi + Zr*Zi + Ci\n\nRuntime on my machine changes from:\nreal\t1m20.563s\n\nTo:\nreal\t2m1.374s\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nInstead of a speedup I see it running 50% slower.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n$ 6g -V\n6g version 6696\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nUbuntu 10.10/maverick\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nhg identify\nc627e23260c7 tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
