It's already allowed with worse\n\u003e syntax and identical performance. Clearly there's not a policy\n\u003e prohibiting sub-optimal implementations.\n\nMultiplication is useful. Even when someone does it by repetitive addition. But there's\nno reason to encourage the incorrect approach by providing support of it.\n\n\u003e That's not a reason to not extend it. No thoughtful basis for the\n\u003e current value has been offered. Is your position that inertia alone\n\u003e is a reason to reject a change that would be helpful for some people?\n\nThat's backward. There should be a reason to extend it.\n\n\u003e Do you really prefer the current situation where the only explanation\n\u003e available is in uncommented source code?\n\nYes, I really do and I even wrote why.\u003c/pre\u003e",
