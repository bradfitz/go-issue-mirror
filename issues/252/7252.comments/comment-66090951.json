It's already allowed with worse syntax and identical performance. Clearly\nthere's not a policy prohibiting sub-optimal implementations.\n\n\u003e IOW, this isn't IMO a compelling reason to extend the limit.\n\nThat's not a reason to not extend it. No thoughtful basis for the current value has been\noffered. Is your position that inertia alone is a reason to reject a change that would\nbe helpful for some people?\n\n\u003e Also, I suggest to intentionally leave the limit undocumented. Otherwise some code can\nstart to rely on this limit, which it should not.\n\nDo you really prefer the current situation where the only explanation available is in\nuncommented source code?\u003c/pre\u003e",
