There has to be a limit.\nThe other implementations use a counter, but using a counter precludes them from\nproviding a useful runtime guarantee. We chose predictable performance; they chose an\nalgorithm that allows input+regexp combinations that will run until the sun burns out.\nBut having paide that cost, they can support larger counts quite \"cheaply\".\n\nSee swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html for more details.\n\nWill fix docs for Go 1.3.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.3**, **documentation**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
