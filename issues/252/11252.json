	"body": "I have been facing a weird problem here and as last resort, I changed the file from being hidden to regular and the exec ran fine. This is the only change I made in the code at all.\r\n\r\nHere's an example.\r\n\r\nNot working:\r\n\r\n    cmd := exec.Command(\"./.file\") //notice the file starts with a dot, this will NOT work \r\n    cmd.Start() //execute it\r\n\r\nWorking:\r\n\r\n    cmd := exec.Command(\"./file\")  //Works fine!!!\r\n    cmd.Start() //execute it\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry if this is meant to happen but well, you should be able to exec whatever you want in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThanks",
