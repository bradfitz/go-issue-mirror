Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. need to make an http.Get request but specify a head (e.g. \n\u0026quot;Authorization\u0026quot; \u0026quot;OAuth\u0026quot;)\n2. see that http.Get doesn't allow this\n3. see how ugly it would be to write an additional stack just to do this \noutside http.Get (http.send is 'private')\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nApologies if there is a simple way to do this which I am missing.\u003c/pre\u003e",
