	"body": "Thank you for checking it out!\r\nI actually did this as a reduced case, but I guess the cause is the same. I'm logging all errors, and didn't see anything similar. The proxy code doesn't use DumpRequest (except with high log levels). DumpRequest knows this and can log it, but I was triggering the same underlying issue. If I find out, I'll bring it.\r\nSince the documentation mentions \"DumpRequest is semantically a no-op\", it triggering the panic is also confusing.",
