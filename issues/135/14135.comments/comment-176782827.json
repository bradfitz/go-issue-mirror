It matches for 5e-6, but not for larger or smaller numbers.\r\n\r\nBy manual binary search it appears that Chrome's algorithm is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabs := math.Abs(x)\r\nif abs == 0 || 1e-6 \u003c= x \u0026\u0026 x \u003c 1e21 {\r\n   use %f\r\n} else {\r\n   use %e\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is kind of a peculiar thing to do, but if all the Javascript engines agree then I don't see significant harm to using the same algorithm for Go. However, a much stronger argument would be if the ECMA-262 spec actually documents and mandates this apparent rule. Does it?",
