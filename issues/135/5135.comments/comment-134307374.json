	"body": "I wouldn't say I know exactly what's going on, but the broad details seem clear enough: you can't run /usr/bin/nohup on a tmux.  If you do, it will fail with the inappropriate ioctl error message.  You should be able to create this yourself in a tmux: \"/usr/bin/nohup ls\".\r\n\r\nWhat we should do in Go is recognize that error message and, if we see it, skip the test rather than failing it.  I don't use Darwin so I can't recreate the problem myself (tmux on GNU/Linux works fine), but it ought to be an easy fix for anyone who can.",
