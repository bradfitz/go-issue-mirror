Since you have `src\\customer.com\\project_a` in `D:\\master`, that is hiding the `src\\customer.com\\project_a` that you have in `D:\\released\\v1`. If you want to build the package in `D:\\released\\v1`, you need to remove `D:\\master` from your search path.\r\n\r\nI don't believe there's any bug in the go command here.",
