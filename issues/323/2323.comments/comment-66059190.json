I tried adding a section to the PE file with the size of\n805306368, but windows complained about validity. I'm (almost) sure I will be able to\nexecute cgo programs with the right person editing the PE file, but after every\ncompilation?\n\nSo I will reinstall windows soon, unless someone resists.\nAnd if the problem ever appears again, I will know if it's a software that I installed\nor a windows setting that I changed.\nProper cgo programs ran successfully in so many windows installations (I take Pokemon\nUniverse as an example) and nobody complained about \"throw: runtime: cannot reserve\narena virtual address space\", so what's the chance that this problem will appear again?\n\nThank you Alex for exploring the problem (until actually discovering it). Seriously,\nwithout your help I was quitting go (until the world moves unix or until I format my\nwindows and accidentally trying a cgo program).\u003c/pre\u003e",
