So that we make a 256mb allocation and then\nanother 512mb allocation?\n\nOn the system that I have which is exhibiting this problem, the two allocations would\nalmost certainly succeed, while the monolithic one does not.\n\n(This question is based on what I see in the code in malloc.goc, correct me if i've\nmisunderstood anything)\n\nThanks,\n\n-Eric\u003c/pre\u003e",
