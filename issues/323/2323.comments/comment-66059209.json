I've only been seeing this problem with dlls that I've introduced\ninto my program by using cgo.  In my particular case, winmm and kernel32 are in high\nmemory where we'd like them to be.  I haven't as of yet seen the scenario where unwanted\ndlls are loaded, or where system dlls are rebased to significantly lower memory\nlocations.\n\nFor the sake of others, I just thought it was worth mentioning that naive use of even a\nsingle dll through cgo could be enough to cause the issue.\n\n-Eric\u003c/pre\u003e",
