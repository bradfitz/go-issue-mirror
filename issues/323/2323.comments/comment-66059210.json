So that we\n\u003e make a 256mb allocation and then another 512mb allocation?\n\nI do not know anything about how memory manager works, but I tried allocating bitmap and\narena in separate / disjoint areas of memory and that fails, because some code, for\nexample pkg/runtime/mgc0.c:1256, assumes that bitmap and arena are together in one chunk\nin that order. Perhaps it is easy to change all that code, but I do not know.\n\nI could be wrong about that, so leaving for others to comment.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
