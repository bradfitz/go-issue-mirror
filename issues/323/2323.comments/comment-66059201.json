The virtual machine and os are 32\nbit, but the host system is 64 bit running Windows 7.\n\nI've read the discussion above, but are we moving towards a solution to this issue? \nThis is a pretty serious problem, one that pretty much eliminates Go as a viable option\nfor Windows software development.\u003c/pre\u003e",
