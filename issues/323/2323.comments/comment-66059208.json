These are loaded by Windows program loader before Go\nexecutable even runs, and we have no control over that. We could, probably, get rid of\nwinmm.dll if that is an issue, so that would leave only kernel32.dll to fight with. Any\nother dlls that Go program might use are loaded during run time well after gc memory is\nreserved, so they wouldn't affect the allocation.\n\nOn the other hand, if you use cgo - then you include code that is build with gcc and\nuses whatever gcc runtime provides. So, whatever other dlls are included by cgo program\nare out of Go control.\n\nAlso, sometimes Windows will load some dlls into your process without you asking for it.\nSome antivirus, firewalls, \"drivers\" just load some dlls into every process to do what\nthey need to do. In that instance you are at the mercy of whoever written that software.\nAnd sometimes that software is buggy and poorly designed.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
