Any public field we add may lock us in or force us to synthesize less than meaningful values when the memory manager's design changes in the future. There's a tension between exposing more information for better performance debugging and exposing as little as possible lest we violate compatibility in the future. Compatibility aside, ideally we would expose enough information to reconstruct the gctrace line programmatically.\r\n\r\nI can imagine various more flexible APIs that would let a caller dynamically detect what information is available. It could be interface-based, map-based, or even reflection-based.",
