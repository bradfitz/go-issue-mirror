	"body": "When vendoring a large package such as [github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3), `go install` will generate the appropriate cache file in $GOPATH/pkg but this will not be used.\r\n\r\nThis is present under `go1.6rc2 windows/amd64` as well as `go1.5.3`. The cache is used when `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=0`. I've checked this with `go build -v`. The environment is windows/amd64 under cygwin. I used govendor to vendor the go-sqlite3 package.\r\n\r\nCompile time went from ~2s to ~36s for me.",
