I modified them to reproduce the issue by changing\r\n\r\n`mv github.com buggy/vendor` to `cp -R github.com buggy/vendor`\r\n`go install -v buggy` to `go install -v github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`\r\n\r\nAs the unvendored source is still in src/, it looks like the `go install` is installing that when explicitly specifying the package name. Removing the unvendored source causes a package not found error.\r\n\r\nSome tools, at least govendor, don't remove the unvendored source when vendoring a package. Perhaps installing a package by name when both unvendored and vendored source are available should result in an error due to ambiguity?",
