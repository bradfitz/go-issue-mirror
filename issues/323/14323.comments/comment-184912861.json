That makes sense.\r\n\r\nThe pairs you posted are working as they should.\r\n\r\nMaybe when vendored packages have a naming collision with an unvendored package present in the same GOPATH, it would worth putting a warning when building to avoid this kind of confusion?\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue as it's solved. Thanks!",
