	"body": "To avoid spurious allocations, sync.Pool should always be used with pointers. For instance, when storing buffers as slices, a pointer to slice should be used instead of the slice itself. This was brought up in http://golang.org/cl/24371 by @dvyukov, but it's not documented.\r\n\r\nSince the primary goal of sync.Pool is to reduce allocations, and using it with non-pointers makes it de-facto useless, it should be prominently documented to avoid using non-pointers with it.",
