	"body": "by **jeffdh**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eRaw quotes within a template cannot include '\\n' which seems counter to the golang\nsyntax that does allow '\\n'.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/ZDIphkpwDh\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/ZDIphkpwDh\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe parser should allow the raw quote with the included '\\n'\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe parser fails thinking the raw quote is unterminated\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nFirst noticed in go1.2, but I see nothing has changed in tip.\nI've attached a patch that addresses the issue and changes the test to match.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/7323/0/text_template_raw_quote.patch\"\u003etext_template_raw_quote.patch\u003c/a\u003e (832 bytes)",
