I was even more surprised that nowhere in the\ndocs does it say you need to read the entire Body if you want the conn to be reused,\nthough it does say that you need to call Close().\n\nHere's an example that shows how it's so easy to do this wrong, not knowing that some\nextra whitespace after the JSON object could cause conns not to be reused:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/QMc9Dt0btS\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/QMc9Dt0btS\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIf you don't think you should change the behavior, I really think it should at least be\ndocumented.\u003c/pre\u003e",
