What if I'm currently in $GOPATH/bin, will it first install the binary, then delete it directly afterwards? Or will `go install` only delete the binary if I don't pass it an import path?\r\n\r\nAnd, since Go is now supposed to decide for me what is stale and what isn't, will running `go test` delete a `*.test` file previously created by `go test -c`?",
