	"body": "In a command directory mycmd, go build writes a binary called ./mycmd. go install writes $GOPATH/bin/mycmd. When you run mycmd after that, you're likely to get the stale binary from the last go build, assuming . is in your path. At the point where go install runs, the previously built binary is by definition stale. go install should probably remove ./mycmd, as if it also did go clean.\r\n",
