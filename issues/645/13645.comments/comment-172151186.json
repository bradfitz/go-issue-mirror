Goroutines 67 and 74 are actively running mark workers. 74 is on M 8 trying to stop the world but is stuck in the loop waiting for other Ms to voluntarily stop. 67 is presumably the one preventing it. Unfortunately, 67 doesn't obviously appear in any of the other thread tracebacks, which is confusing because all of the other threads are clearly at points where they would have switched their Gs out of _Grunning.",
