For example on my machine (Windows 7 x64\nHome Premium), that is not part of a domain, the call takes approximately 4.5 seconds.\n\nIt turns that all that time is spent in syscall.TranslateAccountName, which when you\nlook at msdn\n(\u003ca href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms725484(v=vs.85).aspx)\"\u003ehttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms725484(v=vs.85).aspx)\u003c/a\u003e is for\nDirectory Services, and home workstations are not in a domain.\n\nPerhaps it is better to use NetUserGetInfo first, and revert to TranslateAccountName\nonly if NetUserGetInfo fails, though I'm not yet sure what it returns when machine is in\na domain.\u003c/pre\u003e",
