	"body": "Kubernetes recently added https://github.com/pkg/sftp as a dependency. The sftp package uses the `X__val` member in the `Fsid` struct which we currently replace with `_` on s390x using mkpost.go.\r\n\r\nThe usage is here: https://github.com/pkg/sftp/blob/8197a2e580736b78d704be0fc47b2324c0591a32/server_statvfs_linux.go#L19.\r\n\r\nSince this variable is used on other architectures we should expose it so that sftp will compile (although it may need an endianness fix too). I will send a CL.",
