	"body": "Considering the out-of-band, extra build things, that need to be done to support even a simple protobuf definition/compilation, is there any benefit in extending the current \"go build/install\" and compiler to be able to deal with .proto files (specifically proto3, generating gRPC) in a native manner?\r\n\r\nProposal is to have the compiler recognize imports of files that end in .proto, .proto3, and possibly .grpc, and treat them as if they were the generated *.pb.go files.  In other words, the golang code would look something like:\r\n\r\n```golang\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n  \"fmt\"\r\n  pb \"github.com/someuser/somerepo/someproto.proto\"\r\n)\r\n\r\n//... continue as if \"pb\" was the import of .../someproto.pb.go\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n",
