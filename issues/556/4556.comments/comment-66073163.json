The time.RFC3339 and time.RFC3339Nano constants\nare tiny programs in this tiny language that generate the closest\napproximation to RFC 3339 output that they can, but since the tiny\nlanguage of time.Format has no concept of failing, the best they can\ndo is generate these non-compliant results. This should not be\nconstrued to imply anything about what RFC 3339 requires.\nAgain, RFC 3339 is very clear.\u003c/pre\u003e",
