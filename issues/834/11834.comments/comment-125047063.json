The one thing I can't tell: Is \"Goal of the second GC is set basically to the current heap size\" a bug, an unfortunate side effect of my program in particular, or what?\r\n\r\n@rsc: Thanks for the background. I believe the reason I was mystified by this was that the allocation profile didn't show some very large allocations that only happened a few times. (Which makes sense, it's sampled. Although I do sometimes see such effects even when I've set `runtime.MemProfileRate` to 1.)",
