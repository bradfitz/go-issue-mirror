	"body": "by **arnehormann**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003edatabase/sql attempts to issue queries 10 times (value of maxBadConnRetries) until it\nsucceeds.\n\nWhen all connections are idle for longer than some server timeout, the network\nconnections in the whole connection pool may have been closed by the server.\nIf 10 database connections are tried and all have been closed by the server, the query\nwill return an error.\n\nRecovery is still possible by recreating the connections, but the number of retries\nshould be larger than the pool size (e.g. 1 + db.maxOpen).\u003c/pre\u003e",
