Thanks Ian.\n\nTo anyone else reading this: (With either patch) GDB still misses many 'n' steps,\nconverting them effectively into 'c' commands, continuing execution at full throttle. \n\nSo this lack of being able to step in gdb is still sub-optimal -- but: those bigger\nissues can/should be addressed on ticket 6776.  This ticket 6834 is just for the quick\npatch.\n\nHere this minor repair allows us to continue, because the program hasn't crashed, and\nhence I can just set breakpoints a little further down, catch the runaway, and still get\nalot of useful work done in gdb. \n\nIn short, this is a very useful workaround/incremental fix.\n\nThanks again, Ian.\n\n- Jason\u003c/pre\u003e",
