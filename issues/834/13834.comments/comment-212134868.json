That'd (a) make it possible to go get things like the stress util and (b) make lots more of the stdlib tests pass -- they expect to be able to find the go command.\r\n* The million \"Remote doesn't have\" log lines when initially running `push` are overwhelming.\r\n* It'd be useful to have a way to set the user (in a config?) for folks whose whoami doesn't match their gomote username.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of others looking here for docs, here's how I did some stress testing:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngomote -user josharian create linux-amd64-sid\r\ngomote -user josharian push user-josharian-linux-amd64-sid-0\r\ngomote -user josharian run user-josharian-linux-amd64-sid-0 go/src/make.bash\r\nfor f in `seq 1000`; do gomote -user josharian run user-josharian-linux-amd64-sid-0 go/bin/go test -short net/http crypto/x509; done\r\n```\r\n\r\n(One could use the `-count` flag to go test to loop instead of a bash loop, but that wasn't as effective at reproducing for my particular bug.)\r\n",
