Perhaps it is best\nthat you change your program so that is simpler and does not require any parameters or\ntyping and outputs some data. Then you could tell us what your program outputs and what\nyou think its output should be instead. Just like the original issue template was:\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\n\nPlease use labels and text to provide additional information.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
