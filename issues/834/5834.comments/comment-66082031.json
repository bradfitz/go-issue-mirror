It is part of the standard \"net\" package.\n\nAs I pointed out in my early message, your test should not use both\nnet.Dial and WriteToUDP. The WriteToUDP would fail locally, because\nyou cannot use WriteToUDP on a connected UDP socket. To reproduce the\nfail I reported, the UDP packet should be sent to the remote host to\ntrigger an ICMP reset packet.\n\nYou need to make these changes to your test,\n- replace Dial with ListenUDP\n- check that WriteToUDP does not fail\n- the raddr \"54.244.132.193\" is my EC2 instance. It is up at this\npoint, but you'd better replace it with a well-known host that\ngenerates ICMP reset packets (www.google.com does not send ICMP reset\npackets afaik).\n\nThanks,\u003c/pre\u003e",
