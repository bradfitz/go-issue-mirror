The ReadFrom returns an error \"No service is\noperating at the destination network endpoint on the remote system.\".\nI believe the error is actually for the WriteTo call, as there is no\nrecipient on the remote address. I think the error is triggered by an\nICMP message from the peer, but I did not capture the packet to\nconfirm it.\n\nI have seen the same error on 32-bit windows machines occasionally,\nbut could not find a reliable way to trigger it.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5834/2/readfrombug2.go\"\u003ereadfrombug2.go\u003c/a\u003e (353 bytes)",
