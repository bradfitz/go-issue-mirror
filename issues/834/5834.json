	"body": "by **junshi04**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe bug description is below. The program to reproduce the bug is attached.\n\nOn Windows, net.UDPConn.ReadFrom may return an error of \u0026quot;WSARecvFrom\n...: No service is operating at the destination network endpoint on\nthe remote system\u0026quot;, when the same UDPConn is used to write a packet\nthat has no recipient.\n\nTo reproduce the error, set \u0026quot;-me\u0026quot; to the local IP:port, \u0026quot;-peer\u0026quot; to a\nrandom IP:port, and run the attached file. The ReadFrom will fail\nimmediately with the \u0026quot;No service is operating ...\u0026quot; error.\n\nIf \u0026quot;-peer\u0026quot; is not set, the net.UDPConn is not used to write packets,\nand the ReadFrom won't fail.\n\nIf \u0026quot;-peer\u0026quot; is set to an address with a recipient, the ReadFrom won't\nfail either.\n\nLooks like the error is actually for the write, writing to the peer\nIP:port generates an ICMP error, but the error is returned to the\nReadFrom.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5834/0/readfrombug.go\"\u003ereadfrombug.go\u003c/a\u003e (916 bytes)",
