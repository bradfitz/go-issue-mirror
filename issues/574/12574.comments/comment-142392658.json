	"body": "This will be hugely useful.  I can see a call for size typed ioctls though too.  E.g. IoctlSetInt64 etc.  The reason here is that some of the lower level system calls may expect integers of specific bit widths.\r\n\r\nI'd still also like to have a public ioctl that allows me to pass unsafe pointers.  Yes, I hate the idea of needing to do that, but there are occasions where I have to interface with low level software (e.g. kernel drivers that I have written) where the control interfaces are ioctls.  In the specific cases I've dealt with, I solved this by writing small C programs as microservices, and communicating with them over a messaging framework.  But it would be even nicer if I could have written them entirely in Go.",
