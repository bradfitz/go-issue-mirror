I was reporting about make.bash, which happens earlier (and is called by nacltest.sh).\r\n\r\nYou can get past the \"must be bootstrapped\" issue by running make.bash in the $GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP/src directory, but that doesn't feel like what we want to be doing.\r\n\r\nI agree with Minux that there's some missing part of the cross-compilation story.\r\n",
