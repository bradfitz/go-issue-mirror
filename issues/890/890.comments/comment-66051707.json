Years ago Debian (and BSD)\nswitched to having \"net.ipv6.bindv6only = 1\", Ubuntu still has this set to 0.  Not\nworking in both cases is apparently deemed to be a bug, with Java having been the\nbiggest name system to have had this bug.\n\nSo on Debian Testing with the value 1 (the default) things fail, with the value 0 it\nworks.  On Ubuntu, with the value 0 (the default) things work, with value 1 things fail\nin exactly the same way they do on Debian.  So this is not an Ubuntu/Debian issue per se\nbut a Linux IPv6 related issue in Go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
