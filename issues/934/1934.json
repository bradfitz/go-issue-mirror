	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1.  Use bufio to wrap a socket (as a reader)\n2.  Call read when there is no data avialable on the socket\n3.  Never get data from the socket again\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nAll\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nbece9e7a644b tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nIn bufio.Read() ( \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/src/pkg/bufio/bufio.go?s=3281:3334#L124\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/src/pkg/bufio/bufio.go?s=3281:3334#L124\u003c/a\u003e ), if the\nbuffer is empty (b.w == b.r) and a previous read has resulted in an error (b.err != nil)\nthat it will never again issue a Read to the underlying reader.\n\nThis is a problem in the case of \u0026quot;temporary\u0026quot; errors like that issued by a read\nto a socket with no data avialable.\n\nTwo possible remedies:  provide a bufio.ResetError or test inside the Read method for\nthe temporariness of the error (which might not be desirable, given that there's no\ninterface defining the semantics of the Temporary method that occurs on various error\ntypes).\u003c/pre\u003e",
