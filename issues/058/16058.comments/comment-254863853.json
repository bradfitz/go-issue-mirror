	"body": "You're asking for a magic override to say \"I am sure this is JavaScript, just stuff it here please\". This package used to provide a builtin called \"noescape\" that basically did this, but we decided it was too dangerous, that it made it too easy for people to write unsafe templates, to bypass the template system instead of working with it. This was removed as #3528.\n\nThe cost of having to write something like ToJS is intentional here. Hopefully at the same time you will read the docs for JS and think about the security implications.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n    Use of this type presents a security risk: the encapsulated content should\n    come from a trusted source, as it will be included verbatim in the template\n    output.\n\n    Using JS to include valid but untrusted JSON is not safe. A safe alternative\n    is to parse the JSON with json.Unmarshal and then pass the resultant object\n    into the template, where it will be converted to sanitized JSON when\n    presented in a JavaScript context.\n\n/cc @mikesamuel",
