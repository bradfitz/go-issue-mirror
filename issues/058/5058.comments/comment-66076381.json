It seems that\nthe crypto/tls package already imports sha1. When using certs generated with sha256 I\ngot this error. It wasn't until I found this issue that I figured out what the problem\nwas.\n\nHere is sample code: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/RqN-3GYSW2\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/RqN-3GYSW2\u003c/a\u003e\n\nNote how you get \"x509: certificate signed by unknown authority.\"\n\nIf you simply add _ \"crypto/sha256\" to the import it works.\n\nNow this will probably not be fixed. How would you fix this?  Something that would have\nsaved me hours of time is if this was mentioned in the crypto/tls documentation (perhaps\neven crypto/x509) - at the top.\n\nPlease add a note to the documentation. Thanks!\u003c/pre\u003e",
