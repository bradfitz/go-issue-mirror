	"body": "@josharian added an internal whitelist feature for vetting the standard\r\nlibrary. I think such a whitelisting feature is also useful for outside\r\npackages.\r\n\r\n(If cmd/vet could load project specific plugins, then this feature might\r\nbe less useful, but not all projects need custom vet checkers, so it\r\nstill makes sense to provide a simple whitelisting feature built in.)\r\n\r\nSuch a feature could be built upon @josharian's existing whitelist\r\nfeature (cmd/vet/all).",
