I want to create a Go package that acts like a shared library exposing C functions for other DLLs/exes to load and invoke.  \r\nExample:  I have a Go package \"hello\" that has an exposed method \"SayHello(name string)\".  I want to be able to compile that to a hello.dll that has one exported method \"SayHello\".  A separate C/C++ executable load the hello.dll using LoadLibrary and invoke the SayHello function.",
