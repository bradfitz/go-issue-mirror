	"body": "I have a workaround for problem (1) , the workaround is silly, but it seems pretty stable. Right before the spawn of 'ar' to create the C archive, I added a call to os.Stat() to see if go.o exists, and if so if it is empty or not. After I added this call the build worked perfectly every time.\r\n\r\nCode is here: https://github.com/nadiasvertex/go/commit/0df614097d48f091d8984db0decfce6edefcb0ea\r\n\r\nAt this point, all work for issue #13494  should be complete. Of course, it will need review and testing. I'll read the \"how to contribute\" stuff to submit a patch. As time permits I'll return to the c-shared bug and see what is needed for that.",
