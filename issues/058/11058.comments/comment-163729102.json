I tried to add a section for \".ctors\" but I'm not actually sure what the right thing to do is in the call.\r\n\r\nPutting some hardcoded values in the call does result in a big, empty section called .ctors in the go.o file! So now I suppose I just need to write the contents of the initarray into this area. I'm not really sure how to get a hold of that data, and I'm not really sure how to size the section correctly. \r\n\r\n",
