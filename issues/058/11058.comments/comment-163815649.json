I tried to add a section for \".ctors\" but I'm not actually sure what the right thing to do is in the call.\r\n\r\nYes, you write pe sections in Asmbpe. You can look at, for example, addimports functions to see how it is done. Basically you write whatever contents you want in there and also call addpesection so your section reference is written in section table later. I have never heard about \".ctors\" section, so I wouldn't know what to put there.\r\n\r\n\u003e Putting some hardcoded values in the call does result in a big, empty section called .ctors in the go.o file! So now I suppose I just need to write the contents of the initarray into this area. I'm not really sure how to get a hold of that data, and I'm not really sure how to size the section correctly.\r\n\r\nYou use addpesection to specify the size of your section. It is your responsibility to actually write all the data to te file.\r\n\r\nAlex",
