	"body": "I've made some more progress. I manually killed the padding on this one section after calling addpesection, and that results in the right values in the section header later.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that I need to emit a relocation entry for the .ctors section (which makes perfect sense.) I was unable to reuse the peemitreloc code because it wants to walk a whole symbol chain, and I just want to write one symbol.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I looked at the PE spec from MS, and I think I have most of the information I need. However, I don't seem to be able to get the correct SymbolTableIndex, which is \"A zero-based index into the symbol table. This symbol gives the address that is to be used for the relocation. If the specified symbol has section storage class, then the symbolâ€™s address is the address with the\r\nfirst section of the same name.\"\r\n\r\nAny pointers here would be really helpful.\r\n\r\nAlso note that gcc appears to generate the relocation IN the .ctors section, AGAINST the .text section:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst_2.o:     file format pe-x86-64\r\n\r\nRELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.ctors]:\r\nOFFSET           TYPE              VALUE \r\n0000000000000000 R_X86_64_64       .text\r\n```\r\n\r\nLatest code is: https://github.com/nadiasvertex/go/commit/f0894cbfb254c762a59fc5c4510c5004dfcc76a5\r\n",
