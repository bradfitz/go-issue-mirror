On GNU/Linux it invokes the C linker with -Wl,-Bsymbolic -Wl,-z,relro -shared -Wl,-z,nodelete.\r\n\r\nBasically, if you produce a list of commands that will turn a Windows object file into a Windows DLL, change hostlink to invokes those commands.\r\n\r\nThat said, it's possible that Windows needs to know the list of symbols that are callable from outside the DLL.  It used to need to know that, but it's been many years since I looked at it.  If you need that list of symbols, it's available by looping over the symbol table and looking for the Cgoexport field having a CgoExportStatic flag.",
