Use `go build -x` to see the commands that the Go command is executing.  Make sure that `-buildmode=c-archive` is being passed to the linker.  Use `go build -ldflags=-v` to pass -v to the linker; make sure it is doing the right thing to generate the archive, which I assume means invoking the `ar` command.",
