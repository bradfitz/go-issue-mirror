It's used for the [__declspec(thread) MSVC extension](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9w1sdazb.aspx).\r\n\r\nHere's an old blog post (using 32bits userspace) describing it; http://blog.dkbza.org/2007/03/pe-trick-thread-local-storage.html or http://www.nynaeve.net/?p=183 (there are many blogs talking about it)\r\n\r\nThis removes the need to use TEB, which I agree is less safe. As a matter of fact, all golang .exe could use this too, removing the need for other mean of TLS completely.",
