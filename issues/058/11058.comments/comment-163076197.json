It's probably triple the work, and has\nperformance challenges. Especially when dealing with large string\ntransfers, which is the majority of the work this library would be doing.\n\n\nwhy you think what some other process is doing\n\nmatters\n\n\nBut if, for example, we create a Go DLL with its own runtime that uses the\nsame slot, then calling this DLL from Go executable will be fatal.\n\nI don't see how that can be true. The current go execution modes spec\nrequires one and only one copy of the go runtime per process. Unless I\nmisread it, all copies of the runtime must be merged when linked\n(statically or dynamically.)\n",
