	"body": "Even if you can load two Go DLL into a single process, they\neach will have their own Go runtime so they won't interoperate.\n\nTherefore, I don't think the one Go DLL limitation is unreasonable.\nAnd that's the state of c-shared on other OSes too. Please go\nahead and send the CLs.\n\nSwitching to use Windows TLS is going to have huge performance\nhit for Go. Because we don't know what those TLS functions do\nand how much stack space they require, therefore we have to switch\nto system stack to call them. This must happen at the beginning at\nalmost every function.\n\nWe do have a general solution: reserve one machine register to\nhold g, just like the RISC architectures and treat the reserved\nregister as a write-through cache for the actual TLS slot. However,\nthis has not been implemented yet, and it too will have performance\nimplications.\n",
