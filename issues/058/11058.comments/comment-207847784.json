Apparently this is also a problem on OS X, so I reused that code.\r\n\r\nIf anyone would like to test it and make sure that it solves that problem, that would be great.\r\n\r\nThe \"only\" remaining problem now is determining what to do about thread-local variables in the case that multiple Go runtimes are executing. For example, if a process loads two different DLLs that both have the runtime.",
