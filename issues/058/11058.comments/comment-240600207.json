Because we don't know what those TLS functions do\r\n\u003e and how much stack space they require, therefore we have to switch\r\n\u003e to system stack to call them.\r\n\r\nWe really only need to make TlsGetValue fast. And I did little experiment (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11058#issuecomment-167939906) to see how TlsGetValue looks inside. It looks quite simple on my computer. Perhaps we could assume it does the same everywhere, and use same logic to fetch TLS in Go. We could even limit this to Go DLLs only, so we don't affect normal Go users (executables).\r\n\r\nAlex",
