That's up to the use case.\r\n\r\nI understand why 0 had no suffix here, but I agree that it's a bit too irregular for its own good. It reminds me of ANSI C printf %#x formatting (only) 0 without the 0x prefix, which has caused no end of formatting and parsing surprises. (Go did not adopt this bug.)",
