	"body": "@Sajmani, @adg and I want to create the golang.org/x/sync subrepo for synchronization-related packages.\r\n\r\nIn particular,\r\n\r\n1) singleflight (https://godoc.org/camlistore.org/pkg/singleflight and https://godoc.org/internal/singleflight and google's internal copy, all slightly different because there's no common spot)\r\n2) Group (launch goroutines + capture errors + be a WaitGroup.... https://godoc.org/camlistore.org/pkg/syncutil#Group and Google's internal copy, also diverging).\r\n\r\nThis has grown more important because http2 wants to use singleflight, but http2 is in x/net and internal/singleflight is stdlib-only internal.  I want to put it in x/sync so both stdlib and x/net/http2 can share the same vendored copy (and delete the internal copy).\r\n\r\nFurther, sameer and @bcmills want to open source some google stuff which requires a home.\r\n\r\nx/tools turned into a dumping group, and now x/net is at risk of turning into a dumping ground.\r\n\r\nHence: x/sync for these sync-related things.\r\n\r\n/cc @rsc @adg ",
