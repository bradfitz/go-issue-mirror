The only problem I see is a need to ask everyone who's using `--gccgoflags \"-static\"` or `--ldflags '-extldflags \"-static\"'` to their `go build` command to also add `-tags static`. It would be great if such a tag (or any other we could use) will magically appear itself (similar to $GOOS, $GOARCH or say `cgo` tags), so we won't have to modify all the building scripts.\r\n\r\nIf the above is impossible, I guess we can close this issue.",
