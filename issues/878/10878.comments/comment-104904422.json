	"body": "I modified the `basic` example locally and made it use the same implementation. It turned out that my shaders lacked the following line:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nprecision lowp float;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would cause the app to crash on the tablet without any warning/error whatsoever. Still, that would not explain why the app was crashing when I was just loading the library without calling any methods on it. (Hence not executing any OpenGL calls).\r\n\r\nEven worst (or maybe best), I managed to get it to work somehow, though I am not sure how. Any of the following might have happened.\r\n* After commenting out the usage of the library methods, the change might not have gotten through to the app, so it might have failed due to the shader issue previously.\r\n* I might have had some old artefacts in the `pkg` directory, that were compiled with the old 1.4 Go `GOOS=android` mechanism, which eventually got updated. This is really just a wild guess.\r\n\r\nI don't have access to the tablet right now, but when I do, I will do some experiments with it and if I cannot reproduce the issue, I will close it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
