It will also catch races\n// between Mutex.Lock() and mutex overwrite (mu = Mutex{}).  Since we use\n// only RaceRead() we won't catch races with non-atomic loads.\n// Otherwise (if we use RaceWrite()) we will report races\n// between atomic operations (false positives).\n\nSo the race detector doesn't catch races between atomic operations and non-atomic loads.\nIt should.\u003c/pre\u003e",
