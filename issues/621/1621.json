This would lead to\nsurprising results (e.g., two strings comparing unequal because their bytes are\ndifferent even though their characters are the same).\n\nOne solution is to provide a normalization function so that if this problem arises\npeople can normalize externally received utf-8 bytes.\n\n[PS This isn't a Defect or a Compiler bug -- it is a Suggestion; maybe there should be a\nSuggestion Template?]\u003c/pre\u003e",
