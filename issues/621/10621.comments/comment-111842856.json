It *might* be suitable for x/crypto.\r\n\r\nIt would really be best for the world if all the PKCS standards disappeared so there is a long-term cost to making it easier to use them. However, that doesn't remove the need that some people have to deal with them today.\r\n\r\nIt looks like an RC2 implementation would also have to be pulled in, which is fine, although it should probably be a subpackage of the PKCS#12 packageâ€”hopefully PKCS#12 is the last thing in the world that needs it.\r\n\r\nThe interface of the proposed package (https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/go-pkcs12) looks plausible. As you can probably tell by the latency of my reply, I only get to work on this stuff on the odd weekend so it may take a while to get around to it, but the next step would be to create a code review to add the package to x/crypto.
