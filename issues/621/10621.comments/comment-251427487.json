	"body": "I stumbled upon this Issue due to some research. Sorry to misuse this as mailing list now. Maybe somebody hears me anyway. There was a question about writing PKCS12 certs, which does not look like it is possible, but I want to do exactly that. My question is how. Consider the following `openssl` command: \r\n\r\n```\r\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -inkey input.key -in input.crt -out output.p12 -name \"foo\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow to achieve this in go? Thanks for listening. ",
