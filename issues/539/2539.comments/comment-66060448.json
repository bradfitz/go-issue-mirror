Adding the size of\nstrings, plus map cells, plus breakage and gob overheads that is large but not\nunreasonable.\n\nIf I do an encode and decode, I do see about 1GB, but in that case there is much more\nbreakage because gob must keep the entire message in memory before pushing it out, and\ngrows it incrementally, which is hard on the allocator.\n\nYou can try this to see the usage at various points:\n\n\n\truntime.UpdateMemStats()\n\tfmt.Printf(\"alloc totalalloc free sys %d %d %d\\n\", runtime.MemStats.Alloc, runtime.MemStats.TotalAlloc, runtime.MemStats.Sys)\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-someday**, removed **priority-later**._",
