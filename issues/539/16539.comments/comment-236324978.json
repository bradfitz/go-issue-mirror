	"body": "@jimmyfrasche ah I understand now! There appears to be many valid special characters when placed as flag values (at least for BASH), heres a short list of some that make some amount of sense to me:\r\n\r\n- `-trimprefix=-`: would suggest to me some kind of placeholder with special meaning\r\n- `-trimprefix=.`: Current context in templates, suggests special meaning\r\n- `-trimprefix=^`: reminiscent of regex beginning of line character\r\n\r\nAlthough having 2 separate flags doesn't seem that horrendous of an idea, having 1 flag with a special meaning character will most certainly be harder to get across to the user rather than your example of 2 flags:\r\n\r\n- `-trimprefix=\u003cprefix\u003e`: `flag.String`\r\n- `-autotrimprefix`: `flag.Bool`\r\n\r\nflags are cheap and explicit, special characters are exceptions and harder to communicate.",
