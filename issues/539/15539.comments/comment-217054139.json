Then for `uint64` we could use `fcfidu` when in little endian mode (as you suggested in the CL) and use bitwise/integer instructions to do the cast manually in big endian mode (or something more clever).\r\n\r\nI don't really like the idea of keeping the code the way it is on big endian machines. If a big endian builder is added it won't pass the tests.",
