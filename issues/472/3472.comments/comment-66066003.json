Even with specification I don't think the added complexity would\nbe worth it, and a lot of code would need fixing. E.g. each composite Reader would need\nto manage transient errors from the underlying Reader.\n\nA reader that returns (0, nil) doesn't necessarily break ReadFull or similar code: in\nthe worst case it introduces busy-waiting.\nCurrently the only way for a non-blocking reader to be used as an io.Reader is by\nreturning (0, nil) when not ready, which means busy-waiting in Read loops.\nIf busy-waiting is not acceptable we may as well require that io.Readers are blocking. I\nthink you can abstract Readers more effectively if you abstract blocking and\nnon-blocking separately or if the abstraction always behave as blocking.\u003c/pre\u003e",
