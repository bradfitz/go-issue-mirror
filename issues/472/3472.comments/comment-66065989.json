People have the bad habit to assume too much, and it can happen\nto readers as well as writers.\n\n\"If _some_ data is available but not len(p) bytes, Read conventionally returns what is\navailable instead of waiting for more.\"\n\nI know this sentence is not expressing a requirement, but it may make you think that if\n_no_ data is available, Read just wait until it can return either some bytes or an error.\n\nio.ReadFull() should never return (0, nil) if len(slice) \u003e 0, but it can return\n(len(slice), some_error).\n(looking at the source you can see it never returns (len(slice), io.EOF), but the\ncomment doesn't say that)\u003c/pre\u003e",
