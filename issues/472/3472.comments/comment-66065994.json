It says \"It returns the number\nof bytes copied and an error if fewer bytes were read\". That's \"if\", not \"if and only\nif\". It may be worth clarifying that this can return (len(p),err), but I don't think the\nfunctionality needs to change.\n\nAs for (0,nil), that seems to be to be bad behavior. What Read() implementation in its\nright mind would ever do that? I think we should make sure no Read() implementation\nright now can return (0,nil) and then adjust the documentation to point out that (0,nil)\nis not a valid return value. As an example of how (0,nil) is bad, trying to use\nReadFull() with a Read() that returns (0,nil) will spin forever, and it would not be\nunexpected to find other code that has similarly pathological behavior in the face of\n(0,nil).\u003c/pre\u003e",
