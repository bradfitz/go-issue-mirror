	"body": "Yeah, I thought about that, too, but I don't have a good solution. The same might be said e.g. for SCHILY.acl.*, if someone adds support for POSIX ACLs to Header directly. If the caller to WriteHeader() fills out both the specific Header field and an entry in the PAX extension map, which takes precedence?\r\n\r\nThanks for considering this change. For now, I'm going to have to fork archive/tar to add the necessary functionality, but I'd like to converge back on the official version if/when this feature makes it in.",
