	"body": "I'm not the owner of `archive/tar`, but I personally think that this is a fairly reasonable feature request. I think it's unfortunate that `tar.Header.Xattrs` is specific to the SCHILY.xattrs.* headers only, which is too narrow in functionality.\r\n\r\nIf the package allows for arbitrary vendor extensions, there are some edge cases to think about. For example #13548 requests sparse file support, which can be accomplished using the GNU.sparse.* extended headers. Since these extended headers have semantic meaning in regards to how to read the file, what happens when the user overwrites GNU.sparse.realsize or something? More than likely, the user will end up creating a corrupt file.\r\n\r\nThis will take a little thought, but it's certainly solvable. If I have time, I can try and tackle this in the go1.7 cycle.",
