However, I have seen it used countless times in practice. (For example, try a\nGoogle search with a space in it.) A quick survey of urlencode functions present in\nother languages demonstrates they all convert spaces to '+'.\n\nI'm inclined to leave this as it is. The set of services who would not accept '+'\nmust be tiny, and we shouldn't deviate from the expected behavior to satisfy them.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
