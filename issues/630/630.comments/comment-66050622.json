A quick survey of urlencode functions present in\nother languages demonstrates they all convert spaces to '+'.\"\n\nThat's a very poorly argued case.\n\nIf we search Google for the phrase \"countless times in practice\", we see something\nsimilar to:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=countless+times+in+practice\u0026ie=utf-8\u0026oe=utf-8\u0026aq=t\u0026rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official\u0026client=firefox-a\"\u003ehttp://www.google.com/search?q=countless+times+in+practice\u0026ie=utf-8\u0026oe=utf-8\u0026aq=t\u0026rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official\u0026client=firefox-a\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe spaces separating the words in the query have been replaced by plus (+) signs, as\nper the HTML specification (application/x-www-form-urlencoded).\n\nHTML 4.01 Specification: 17.13.4 Form content types\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1\"\u003ehttp://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe enctype attribute of the FORM element specifies the content type used to encode\nthe form data set for submission to the server. User agents must support the content\ntypes listed below. Behavior for other content types is unspecified.\n\nPlease also consult the section on escaping ampersands in URI attribute values.\n\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded  \n\nThis is the default content type. Forms submitted with this content type must be\nencoded as follows:\n\n1. Control names and values are escaped. Space characters are replaced by `+', and\nthen reserved characters are escaped as described in [RFC1738], section 2.2:\nNon-alphanumeric characters are replaced by `%HH', a percent sign and two hexadecimal\ndigits representing the ASCII code of the character. Line breaks are represented as\n\"CR LF\" pairs (i.e., `%0D%0A').\n\n2. The control names/values are listed in the order they appear in the document. The\nname is separated from the value by `=' and name/value pairs are separated from each\nother by `\u0026'.\u003c/pre\u003e",
