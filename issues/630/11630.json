	"body": "After splitting the app package from gobind (CL 11654), the log redirection to Android logcat (app/stdio_android.go) is not setup automatically for gobind-based apps.\r\n\r\nA workaround is manually importing \"golang.org/x/mobile/app\", but this is both surprising and wasteful (app pulls in the gl package). Perhaps the logging setup should be done in a separate (internal) package?",
