And now that I\nthink about it that is normal for this case, as the external linker is not needed to\nhandle a shared library.\n\nSo now I think the problem is that 6l's -r option is not supported for Mach-O.  I don't\nsee any support for it--I only see support for it for ELF.  I don't know what needs to\nbe done here.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **expertneeded**._",
