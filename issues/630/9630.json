	"body": "With Go 1.4 I am able to build the GOXC cross-compiler (https://github.com/laher/goxc) and its tool chain (``goxc -t``). After installing Go 1.4.1, it no longer possible to build the tool chain.\r\n\r\nFor Go 1.4.1, within Go's ``pkg`` directory, there are just a few header files (*.h) for most CPUs and GOXC was not able to copy the final Go tools to ``bin`` and therefore, afterwards it is not able to cross-compile with 1.4.1.\r\n\r\nBecause the GOXC code does not changed within the last time, i create the issue directly here.",
