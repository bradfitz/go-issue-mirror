	"body": "Comparing MOVSB vs MOVSD I'd say that MOVSQ can be better for 5-7% on SandyBridge for aligned data. I also think that memmove implementation can distinguish aligned and unaligned cases. The same time SandyBridge is quite old architecture and for Haswell and newer archs rep movs isn't the best solution. So I'm going to return with AVX-based implementation for modern CPUs.",
