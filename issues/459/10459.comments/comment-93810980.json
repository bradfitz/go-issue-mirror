	"body": "Upon further investigation, I think I was using the wrong cert, as a push notification cert doesn't have critical extensions based on the docs. I need to check with a colleague that I have the right certs and double check if this is still an issue for me. [Update: Confirmed, this isn't an issue for me right now, but it would be something nice to resolve for future use.]\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the error handling could be improved. If instead of:\r\n\r\n\u003e x509: unhandled critical extension\r\n\r\nIt could include the ID\r\n\r\n\u003e x509: unhandled critical extension (1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.2.0.0)\r\n\r\nIt would've been a lot easier to hunt down the issue.",
