	"body": "The current downloads page leaves a lot to be desired. It provides an overwhelming amount of information, but not the essential pieces.\r\n\r\nIdeally it should be the single page a user needs to visit to set up a working Go tool chain.\r\n\r\nHere's my proposed download page flow:\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n* Step 1: on page load\r\n\r\nShow a set of radio buttons for the user to select their OS/ARCH combination:\r\n(Use the User-Agent HTTP header to detect the relevant OS/Arch combination and\r\npre-select it.)\r\n\r\n        Operating System        Processor Architecture\r\n        [ ] Windows             [ ] 64-bit x86 (amd64)\r\n        [ ] Mac OS X (darwin)   [ ] 32-bit x86 (386)\r\n        [ ] Linux\r\n        [ ] FreeBSD\r\n\r\n                        [ Download ]\r\n\r\n* Step 2: the file is downloading\r\n\r\nWhen they click `Download`, replace the os/arch form with an installation message:\r\n\r\n        You are now downloading go1.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz.\r\n        (If the download does not start automatically, [click here].)\r\n        \r\n        Once you have downloaded the archive, you should install it:\r\n        \r\n                $ sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz\r\n                \r\n        Add `/usr/local/go/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable,\r\n        and set the `GOPATH` environment variable to a suitable location \r\n        (NOT the installation path; see [this document] for more about GOPATH).\r\n        \r\n(With different variations for OS X, Windows, etc.)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nObviously we'll need some finessing on the messaging around `GOPATH`, but the central idea is hiding all the irrelevant options and providing basic installation instructions.",
