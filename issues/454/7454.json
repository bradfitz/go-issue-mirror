	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eHTTP PATCH requests are defined in this rfc: \u003ca href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789\"\u003ehttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe problem is that the current implementation for ParseForm is hardcoded to only parse\nforms coming from POST or PUT requests, ignoring PATCH requests:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/net/http/request.go#731\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/net/http/request.go#731\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe PostForm field should also be populated when making PATCH requests, from what I\ncould see, the underlying parsePostForm function wouldn't have an issue parsing a PATCH\nrequest but we have a condition check that is preventing the parsing:\n\nif r.Method == \u0026quot;POST\u0026quot; || r.Method == \u0026quot;PUT\u0026quot; {\n    r.PostForm, err = parsePostForm(r)\n}\n\nI would gladly submit a patch but I have yet to understand the process to create a\ncodereview request.\u003c/pre\u003e",
