	"body": "The code works in 1.3 doesn't mean it's correct.\r\n1.3's GC ignores invalid pointers on heap, but 1.4 doesn't\r\ntolerate them.\r\n\r\nIdentify the pointer, and switch to use uintptr if it's not a Go\r\nheap pointer.\r\n\r\nFor common example of this sort of problem is the HANDLE\r\ntype on Windows. It's defined as a pointer, but it actually stores\r\nintegers.\r\n\r\nI'd first start with go vet your code and pay close attentions to\r\ncases where unsafe, custom assembly, or cgo is used. If you're\r\nusing assembly, you might need to update them for 1.4, see\r\ngolang.org/doc/go1.4#asm.\r\n\r\nIf you suspect it's a runtime problem, please provide a small\r\nreproduction example.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue, because it's not actionable. Try\r\nasking on golang-nuts for more advices on how to track this\r\nkind of bug down. Thanks.",
