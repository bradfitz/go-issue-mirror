I'd missed that discussion and added my displeasure with this \nchange there, but I can see I'm a few days late.  It's more than just braces, it's \nwhitespace in general (for example, did you know we lost the ability to have \nadjacent string literals concatenated?  m := \"This is a \" \"long message\" now no \nlonger works as well; it was very handy, especially if the strings were truly very \nlong).\n\nI do think this change was a bad idea which adds a lot of unnecessary awkwardness \nand non-orthogonality to the language (which I've thoroughly enjoyed up to this \npoint).  I'm disappointed it's WontFix at this point and would hope to see this \nissue revisited in the future.\u003c/pre\u003e",
