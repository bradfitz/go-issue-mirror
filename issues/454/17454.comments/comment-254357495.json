I think they should be in scope at block definition, not when they're applied/run.\r\n\r\nThe scenario I had in mind:\r\n\r\n    type Names struct {\r\n        First string\r\n        Last []string\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    {{$first := .Names.First}}\r\n    {{define \"names\"}} {{range .}} {{$first}} {{.}} {{end}} {{end}}\r\n    [...]\r\n    {{template \"names\" .Names.Last}}\r\n\r\nThis won't work, but seems like it should, and it would be useful.",
