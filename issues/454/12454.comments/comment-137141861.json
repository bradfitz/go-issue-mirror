We don't have any C code that needs this checking anymore, but there is Go code (and assembly, probably) that does.  We should probably be using go:systemstack in other places, for example in all the stack copying code, signal handlers, etc.\r\n\r\nMaybe a rename of Cfunc and morestackc is in order, though.\r\n",
