At that point the link is no longer in any particular package directory, and in\nparticular it is not in the package directory where libwrapper.a sits. You need to use\nan absolute path to libwrapper.a or else install it somewhere standard and use\n-lwrapper. Since there is only one link but many packages, we can't support this\nbehavior.\n\nNote that you can put your code into a wrapper_linux_amd64.syso file and that will be\npassed to the final linker command automatically.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
