	"body": "The net/http package needs a way to wait for readability on a TCPConn without actually reading from it. (See #15224)\r\n\r\nhttp://golang.org/cl/22031 added such a mechanism, making Read(0 bytes) do a wait for readability, followed by returning (0, nil). But maybe that is strange. Windows already works like that, though. (See new tests in that CL)\r\n\r\nReconsider this for Go 1.8.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could add a new method to TCPConn instead, like WaitRead.",
