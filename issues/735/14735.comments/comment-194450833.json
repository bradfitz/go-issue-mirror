It would no longer be the case that the next GC cycle triggers \"when the ratio of freshly allocated data to live data remaining after the previous collection reaches this percentage.\"\r\n\r\n\u003e Note that heap growth can't continue infinitely, so the amount of additional CPU is limited.\r\n\r\nDon't we return unused pages to the OS (e.g. via MADV_DONTNEED) after a spike subsides?  To cap the amount of additional CPU we'd probably need to stop doing that (which I'd argue is fine, but I would expect to encounter many users who vehemently disagree).",
