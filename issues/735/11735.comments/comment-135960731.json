	"body": "@levilovelock Such questions are better asked at StackOverflow or other forums IMO. Although your question does uncover some package docs' flaws. Let's go point by point.\r\n\r\nFirstly, your data doesn't seem to define the `xmpp` namespace anywhere. It should be something like\r\n```xml\r\n\u003cbody rid=\"1234\" xmpp:version=\"1.0\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns:xmpp=\"urn:xmpp:xbosh\" /\u003e\r\n```\r\nSecondly, namespace URLs and names in tags are separated by spaces, *not* colons. This point clearly doesn't get enough attention in the package docs.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the `xml` prefix is defined as `http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace`. The docs do mention www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/ which in turn mentions this namespace, but I think this should be made clearer.\r\n\r\n(Fourthly your capitalization does not conform to the [Go style recomendations](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#initialisms) but that's just me nitpicking.)\r\n\r\nWith all that in mind, here is your type:\r\n```go\r\ntype Payload struct {\r\n\tXMLName xml.Name `xml:\"body\"`\r\n\tRID     int      `xml:\"rid,attr\"`\r\n\tXMLLang string   `xml:\"http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace lang,attr\"`\r\n\tXMPPVer string   `xml:\"urn:xmpp:xbosh version,attr\"`\r\n}\r\n```\r\nPlayground: http://play.golang.org/p/YLOJozEqFl.",
