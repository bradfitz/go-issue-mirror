Or is this a low-priority feature request?\r\n\r\nMore aggressive inlining would certainly give a large performance boost to a lot of constructs. For example, inlining thunk functions (#8421) and inlining functions that can't inline all the way down (@dr2chase comment in #11189). The last one would certainly help me in one spot: https://github.com/tdewolff/buffer/blob/master/lexer.go#L158, which is a function that is called very often but only sometimes calls the costly `read` function. `Peek` would increase performance for the parsers using this library by 10%-20%, which is a lot!",
