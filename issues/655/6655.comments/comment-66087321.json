However, you are on a 64-bit system so I\ndon't think that's the problem.\n\nWhen \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/4869\"\u003eissue #4869\u003c/a\u003e came up I spent a long time reading the math/big division routines, and\nI believe the code is correct. So this is probably another memory corruption, somehow.\nPerhaps Dmitriy has an idea.\n\nIt is definitely concerning that you saw this.
