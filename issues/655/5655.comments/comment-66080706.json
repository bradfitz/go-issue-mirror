We don't explicitly ignore files named \"_test.go\", but the build\ninfrastructure does explicitly ignore any file that begins with a dot or an underscore.\nSo the docs are technically correct by omission. :P\n\nSo, the cmd/go docs need to be updated to mention that files beginning with . and _ are\nignored.\n\nThe go/build package docs do mention it, though:\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/go/build/#Context.Import\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/pkg/go/build/#Context.Import\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @adg._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
