	"body": "Let's keep this bug about @dsnet's original topic. `sort.Slice` doesn't involve any interfaces, so that's not relevant here.\r\n\r\nIt does appear that both `reflect.ValueOf` and `reflect.Swapper` (which itself uses `ValueOf`) cause the slice to escape. Replacing both of those with dummy versions shows that that the slice doesn't escape, so this has nothing to do with quicksort or recursive functions.\r\n\r\nIf we fixed reflect.ValueOf, it should be possible to sort things on the stack without allocations.\r\n",
