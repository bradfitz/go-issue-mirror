I took that word from the title of Rob\nand Ken's paper \u003ca href=\"http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/utf.html\"\u003ehttp://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/utf.html\u003c/a\u003e, where it is\npart of the larger phrase \u001b$B$3$s$K$A$O\u001b(B \u001b$B@$3\u0026\u001b(B, which I believe to be Japanese.\nFrom\nsome research it appears that \u001b$B@$3\u0026\u001b(B means world in both Chinese and Japanese,\nwhile \u001b$B$3$s$K$A$O\u001b(B is unambiguously Japanese. By using only part of the phrase I\nintroduced the ambiguity.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=chinese+word+for+world\"\u003ehttp://www.google.com/search?q=chinese+word+for+world\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=japanese+word+for+world\"\u003ehttp://www.google.com/search?q=japanese+word+for+world\u003c/a\u003e\n\nSo I think the video is correct as written. If I were recording it again I\nwould say \"Chinese or Japanese\" or else change the example. But I don't\nbelieve I have the original screencast source file anymore.\n\nI apologize for any offense.\u003c/pre\u003e",
