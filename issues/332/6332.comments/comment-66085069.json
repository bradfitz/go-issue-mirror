I took that word from the title of Rob and Ken's\npaper \u003ca href=\"http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/utf.html\"\u003ehttp://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/utf.html\u003c/a\u003e, where it is part of the larger phrase\nこんにちは 世界, which I believe to be Japanese. From some research it appears\nthat 世界 means world in both Chinese and Japanese, while こんにちは is\nunambiguously Japanese. By using only part of the phrase I introduced the ambiguity.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=chinese+word+for+world\"\u003ehttp://www.google.com/search?q=chinese+word+for+world\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=japanese+word+for+world\"\u003ehttp://www.google.com/search?q=japanese+word+for+world\u003c/a\u003e\n\nSo I think the video is correct as written. If I were recording it again I would say\n\"Chinese or Japanese\" or else change the example. But I don't believe I have the\noriginal screencast source file anymore.\n\nI apologize for any offense.\u003c/pre\u003e",
