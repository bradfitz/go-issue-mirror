	"body": "net/http supports HTTP proxies, where HTTPS is achieved with CONNECT. It would be nice to add support for HTTPS proxies (https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/secure-web-proxy), where the client first establishes a TLS connection to the proxy.\r\n\r\nhttp://tip.golang.org/src/net/http/transport.go?#L754\r\n\r\n    // Note: no support to https to the proxy yet.\r\n\r\nMaybe Transport.DialTLS (http://godoc.org/net/http#Transport) could be used for that. Currently it says:\r\n\r\n    // DialTLS specifies an optional dial function for creating\r\n    // TLS connections for non-proxied HTTPS requests.",
