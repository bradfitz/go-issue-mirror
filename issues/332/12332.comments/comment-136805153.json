That button is just misplaced.)\r\n\r\nA comment about the context: I agree with @minux that it's nicer to have the context information in the values. But that comes at some cost: More memory per value, and a question of what to do when two values interoperate (e.g., a + b) with different context information. The reason I decided to go that route in big.Float is that the extra data per Float object is relatively small compared to the (presumably) large Float object. The other reason is that it was possible to \"merge\" the context information (which is just the precision in this case, by choosing the larger one).\r\n\r\nJust something to keep in mind.\r\n",
