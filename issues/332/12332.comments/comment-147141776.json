Right now I I'm using *big.Rat, but, it would be painful if it was more complicated in Go. If we get a go ahead to implement an accounts receivable module, I may need to revisit my types. If I had a decimal type in the std lib, that would make my choice very easy and clear.\r\n\r\nI'm hesitant to use a third party package simply due to trust (this is handling money) and verifying such a package is not my primary skill set.\r\n",
