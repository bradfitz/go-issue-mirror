	"body": "The reason for fixed precision decimal type seems to be that you want to\npass it by value, but different projects might have different requirement on\nprecision, thus I think if the package is to be generally useful, the\nprecision\nmust be configurable, but that would conflict with the desire to pass\ndecimals\nby value.\n\nI still think it's best to live outside of the standard library and\navailable as a\ngo generate template package so that people can generate decimal packages\nof different sizes and include in their projects.\n\nAnd in that case, it's probably best to be branded the package as an\narbitrary but fixed precision fixed-point package. If you think outside the\nfield of financial computations, fixed-point types of various sizes are all\nuseful (e.g. in DSP applications).\n",
