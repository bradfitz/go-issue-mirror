If not, would it make sense to keep currency code (possibly custom 3-letter string, with suggestion to use [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), but still allowing e.g. [NUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_unit_of_construction_(airlines))s) encoded in each such number value, and disallow operations on Decimals of differing currencies? I see various pros and cons; not sure if this is good idea, but maybe worth considering.",
