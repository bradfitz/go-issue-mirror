What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version devel +0436a89 Mon Apr 25 19:21:40 2016 +0000 linux/ppc64le\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\ngo env\r\nGOARCH=\"ppc64le\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"ppc64le\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/home/boger/gotools\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/home/boger/golang/atomic/go\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/home/boger/golang/atomic/go/pkg/tool/linux_ppc64le\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -pthread -fmessage-length=0 -fdebug-prefix-map=/tmp/go-build937495002=/tmp/go-build -gno-record-gcc-switches\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nDuring some performance analysis of various applications it was found that some of the atomic functions appeared high on the profile list, and on further inspection of that code it was determined that some of those code sequences could be improved for ppc64le \u0026 ppc64. \r\n\r\nThe files to be changed are:\r\nruntime/internal/atomic/asm_ppc64x.s\r\nsync/atomic/asm_ppc64x.s\r\n\r\nThe main purpose is to eliminate the extra sync instructions.  I have a patch and will post it shortly.\r\n\r\n",
