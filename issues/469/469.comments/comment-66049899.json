The way it stands, you can't tell by looking at short declaration of multiple\nvariables which, if any of the variables are existing.  You have to read back through\nthe code and hunt for previous declarations of each variable.  If I add a short\ndeclaration to some code, I might like the compiler to complain if I am stepping on\nan existing variable.\u003c/pre\u003e",
