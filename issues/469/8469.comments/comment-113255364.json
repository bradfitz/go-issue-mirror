I understand that its difficult to change the current behaviour, but I suggest that some version of this is added in Go 2.0 when the time comes. I guess, as discussed, the whole api might need a refresh at some point. For now, anyone that need it can just google and find this discussion with working code to use in their own project. Since most of it is ripped from the Golang standard library anyway, the attached code has the same license as the Go standard library and is in my opinion fully owned by the Golang developer team; crossing my fingers and hoping that some version of this is included in the standard library at some point :)\r\n\r\n@mattn thanks for pushing this discussion :)",
