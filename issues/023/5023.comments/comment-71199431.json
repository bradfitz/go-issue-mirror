It gets really confusing when it comes to memory model let alone multiple changes to it in different versions of the language. So does that means the quote from Dmitry: \"It's perfectly fine to allow any code to hoist above [a buffered] chan send, or to sink below [a buffered] chan receive.\" is ineffective now and go compiler(s) is not allowed to reorder statements when it comes to the same situation with buffered channels?",
