	"body": "I am writing a program with a bit buffer and a bit count. For good reasons it makes sense for the count to be something other than int (for example, you're shifting by it a lot, so it makes sense for it to be unsigned).\r\n\r\n\tpackage main\r\n\timport \"fmt\"\r\n\tfunc main() {\r\n\t\tvar bits uintptr = 5\r\n\t\tvar count uintptr = 5\r\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"%*b\\n\", count, bits)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nprints \"%!(BADWIDTH)101\". http://play.golang.org/p/BGxyBdPV5E\r\n\r\nIt seems like maybe fmt should allow any integer type for the width. It's a tiny bit more effort in the code and it eliminates an annoyance for users. In my case I didn't know what BADWIDTH meant and at first thought the value was actually bad in some way. It was only when I was about to read the docs that I realized the problem was likely the type.\r\n\r\n@robpike ",
