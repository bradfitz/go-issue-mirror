	"body": "by **Metal3d**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the\nlatest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/YiBFs4e7di\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/YiBFs4e7di\u003c/a\u003e\n2. Run program\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nFunctions that exepect interface type should not accept any other object that have not\nimplemented expected interface.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nNo error, and it's not \u0026quot;logical\u0026quot;\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\ntried on last go gc repository and playground\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux Fedora 16 x86_64\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n1.0.2\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nIt should be normal to not accept function parameters that have not implemented\ninterface... is it ?\n\n\nTryToEat function must not accept Car. But it does... \n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/YiBFs4e7di\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/YiBFs4e7di\u003c/a\u003e\nLine 39, I call \u0026quot;TryToEat\u0026quot; with a Car struct. \n\nCar is not \u0026quot;Eatable\u0026quot;, Apple is.\n\nTryToEat expect Eatable structure. If I call TryToEat with a Car, it works without error.\n\nSo, we have to check types manually. I know this example is not very usefull but it\nshows what I suppose to be not correct.\n\n(excuse my english)\n\nRegards,\u003c/pre\u003e",
