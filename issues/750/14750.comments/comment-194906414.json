I thought we only did the case insensitive thing when there was no struct tag.\r\n\r\nBut from the ietf link above:\r\n\r\n\u003e is looks quite diabolical for security as it is trivial to create valid JSON values that will be interpreted differently by different implementations.\r\n\r\nRelated to \"differently by different implementations\", we permit JSON keys twice: http://play.golang.org/p/lPgEj1T6Zk (two \"alg\"). That probably differs between implementations in either its output or whether it's even successful.\r\n",
