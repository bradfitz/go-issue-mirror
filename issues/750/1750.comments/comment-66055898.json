I patched in the old arm5 asm from\n\u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=5a47c03cf0\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=5a47c03cf0\u003c/a\u003e and now cannot cause tests like\ngofix or chan/doubleselect.go to deadlock.\n\nI'm going to setup a few tests cases and run them overnight to see if there are any\nlingering deadlocks.\n\nCheers\n\nDave\u003c/pre\u003e",
