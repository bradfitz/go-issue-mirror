	"body": "\u003ethe syscall package is a mismash of incompatible implementations. The go runtime does not use syscall.Time, it uses an implementation of nanotime(2), although that depends on the platform you are calling it on.\r\n\r\nI see. And also runtime's `getrlimit` is implemented by `ugetrlimit`.\r\nYes, runtime's implementation looks like more sophisticated and well tested than syscall's one to me.\r\n\r\n\u003eIf there is a fix that needs to be made, it will be in the x/sys/unix package, the syscall package is closed for modifications.\r\n\r\nFair enough.\r\n\r\nBy the way, do you want to accept such a trivial bug report?\r\nI know you guys work for more important issues everyday.\r\nMaybe you don't want to spare time for trivial one.\r\nMaybe you don't want to see the issue tracker is filled by trivial ones.\r\nI don't want annoy you. That's not my intention.\r\nSo when I found a trivial issue, what should I do?\r\n\r\nThank you for responses, anyway.",
