	"body": "If gccgo does reject this program, it isn't clear to me how many shifts would be allowed before it becomes a stupid shift. gc and go/types already disagree on this point, with go1.5 putting the limit on stupidness at 512 bits and go/types limiting it around 1024 bits. It's weird that if the expression was `1 \u003e\u003e 1000`, now go/types and gccgo would accept it while gc would not. If we wanted to fix the differences between the compilers, what's the right thing to do here?",
