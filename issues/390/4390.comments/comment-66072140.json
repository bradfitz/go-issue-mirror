We're not a Chunked-Body reader, because an io.Reader doesn't know how\nto read HTTP trailers.  The chunked reader only reads until the EOF, and then lets the\nHTTP ReadResponse read the trailer and final CRLF.\n\nIf anything, this is a documentation fix.\n\nAt least, that's my recollection, but you looked at this more recently.  Does that\nexplanation make sense?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
