	"body": "What if you move the allocation of C up out of the for { } loop, so that there is only one C reused on each iteration? Does it still die?\n\nIf so, the next step is to run with 'export GOGC=off' in your environment and see if it still dies. I believe that if C is moved out, there will not be any allocations in the for { } loop, so you should be able to run for a while even with garbage collection off.",
