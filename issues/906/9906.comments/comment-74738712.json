If it happens, it is always a continuous segment of a row (somewhere in the middle) or a couple of such segments on different rows. It is never scattered.\r\n\r\nSo, taking into consideration the fact that data are stored columnwise, one can speculate that the [middle loop][1] over `j` somehow skips several successive `j`s, or the [final assignment][3] is not executed for several successive `j`s, potentially with the [innermost loop][2] over `k`.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/IvanUkhov/puzzle/blob/d1cb630f7be08dcc595e2403f4c0ddd57c0f5ffe/main.go#L62\r\n[2]: https://github.com/IvanUkhov/puzzle/blob/d1cb630f7be08dcc595e2403f4c0ddd57c0f5ffe/main.go#L64\r\n[3]: https://github.com/IvanUkhov/puzzle/blob/d1cb630f7be08dcc595e2403f4c0ddd57c0f5ffe/main.go#L67",
