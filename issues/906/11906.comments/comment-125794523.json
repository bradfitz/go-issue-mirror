The immediate motivation is to start thinking about an abstraction of font rendering that isn't necessarily tied to Freetype (and its idiosyncratic license). A draw.Image that you draw glyphs on always works in pixels and sub-pixels, not inches, so geom.Pt simply doesn't apply there.\r\n\r\nAlso, the footnote at the bottom of https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/LayoutUnit suggests that WebKit discussed this in 2012 and stuck with fixed point (changing the atom from 1/60 to 1/64) and didn't take the opportunity to move to floats, despite having to interop with floats and Darwin.",
