Float *has* become faster on most platforms, but there is still a factor 2-4 in performance when dealing with images. \r\n\r\nAlso float\u003c-\u003eint conversions (which are costly on i386 for instance) are completely avoided, and certain mod operations, as well as remainder can be calculated with simple `\u0026` operations, which will always involve a division or float-\u003eint-\u003efloat conversion.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I don't really know is that the actual size isn't obvious. What about this slightly longer form?\r\n\r\n```Go\r\n// Int26x6 is a 26.6 fixed point number.\r\ntype Int26x6 int32\r\n\r\n// Int52x12 is a 52.12 fixed point number.\r\ntype Int52x12 int64\r\n```\r\n",
