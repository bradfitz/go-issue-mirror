The most recent numbers I found are 8 years old, and I have heard at least two contrary anecdotes about modern Intel chips. I've also found nothing about arm64, or where ARM chips are expected to be in the next couple of years.\r\n\r\nTransistor constraints meant it used to make sense to run the FPUs at a different clock speed to the integer unit, and to have fewer FPUs than ALUs per core, so there were limited instruction dispatch advantages for float32. But those explanations were waning a decade ago. SSE is full of floating point ops now.\r\n\r\nAt this point I think any claim to performance advantages needs to be supported with recent data.",
