You should look at the spec of the other languages.\n\n\u003e The implementation restriction explains the deviations that implementations\n\u003e can make from the ideal.\n\nBut the spec doesn't show the link between the \"implementation restriction\" and how\nconstant expressions are evaluated. In particular because one can do exact arithmetic\nbased on floating-point arithmetic with limited precision (at least when you are\nrestricted to the arithmetic operations and the square root), if a spec says that\nconstant expressions are evaluated exactly, the user is in right to assume that they\nare really evaluated exactly.\u003c/pre\u003e",
