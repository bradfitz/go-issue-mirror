	"body": "Thanks @pebbe. Could I get you to try another thing? Run the gdb-in-gdb again, but after the backtrace, run the \"finish\" gdb command repeatedly until it freezes again. This will cause gdb to run to the completion of each function in the backtrace, one at a time. Once you've unwound far enough, you'll reach whatever function is going off the deep end, which won't return from the \"finish\".",
