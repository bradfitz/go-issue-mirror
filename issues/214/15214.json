	"body": "The linux/ppc64le builders on OSUOSL are very slow. It looks like their disk is slow, and /tmp (where the builders build by default) is on a disk of some sort.\r\n\r\nWe should setup a /workdir tmpfs like we do for linux/arm and configure the builders to build there. We'd also need swap enabled, since the amount of RAM on the VMs is marginally sufficient to keep the workdir in memory.\r\n\r\n",
