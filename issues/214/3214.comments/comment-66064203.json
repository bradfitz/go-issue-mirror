I don't see anything even remotely related to godoc server\nicon or else on my desktop.\n\nGo run, go get, go install, go build all run well under Windows 7 and power shell. the\ndefault executable on windows does not have the .exe extension, you have to \"go build -o\nmain.exe main.go\" which is kinda slugish.\n\nI could build and install without setting GOPATH or GOROOT, everything else is fine.\u003c/pre\u003e",
