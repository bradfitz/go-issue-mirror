It would be nice to firm up the 'desired register' code for s390x but it isn't as important.\r\n\r\nI'm not completely certain but it looks to me like the desired registers aren't triggered in this case because the `Block` containing the `STMG` instruction has a successor that is also a predecessor and has already been processed.\r\n\r\nIn other words B2's desired registers are  ignored if B1 is processed first and B1 is a successor of B2:\r\n\r\n```\r\n──\u003e B1 ───\u003e B2 ──\u003e\r\n    ^       │\r\n    └───────┘\r\n```\r\n",
