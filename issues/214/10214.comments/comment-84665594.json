	"body": "From a quick read, it seems that the Windows builder appears to pass the `supportsIPv6` test, and has one non-loopback interface (\"Local Area Connection\") but no interface (0 out of 1) has an IPv6 address.\r\n\r\nFrom https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking#networks :\r\n\r\n\u003e All Compute Engine networks use the IPv4 protocol. Compute Engine currently does not support IPv6. However, Google is a major advocate of IPv6 and it is an important future direction.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what `TestInterfaces` is trying to test.  The `probeIPv6Stack` function just tries to make \u0026 bind some syscall.AF_INET6 sockets, which works.  So I guess the assumption is that there should be some interface with an IPv6 address to which they must be bound?\r\n\r\nI'll also note that when I rebuilt this Windows image, Google has in the meantime also updated the base layer Windows image (it's now 30GB instead of 100GB, and has some new GCE-specific tweaks I think), so it's not identical to what it was before, even though I followed the same setup procedures.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I'm not working on this bug. Help wanted.\r\n",
