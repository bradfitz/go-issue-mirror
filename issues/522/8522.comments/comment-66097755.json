The people using the API aren't\nchanging how the layers interact, there should be no need to modify the code which the\nHTTP layer uses to talk to the TLS layer.\n\nIn effect, we want to be able to set TLS policy; in this case, on whether or not to\naccept an X.509 certificate; some parts of the policy are already available (chain back\nto trust anchor; hostname to validate) others aren't.  This is no different from the TLS\nverifications already available, except in not being available, so a callback made the\nmost sense.\n\nThe original PR/patch changed the \"net/http\".Transport but changing \"crypto/tls\".Config\ninstead lets us make the policy checks available to all TLS clients, not just HTTP and\nis better, you're right.\u003c/pre\u003e",
