	"body": "Under normal circumstances you would place test code into a file matching the `test` build constraint/tag, e.g. `my_test.go`. The naming convention of the file has led me to believe that this is a build constraint/tag.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not possible to _exclude_ some code from being built into tests ran by `go test`, because writing a file like `foo.go`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// +build !test\r\n\r\npackage foo\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill always compile under `go test`. This is a shame because there are some situations that do warrant different behavior for testing, and this makes it hard to deal with such situations.",
