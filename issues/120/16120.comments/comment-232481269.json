	"body": "@alexbrainman I think the fix for the program running `go generate` in the syscall package is to move the `//go:generate` comment from syscall_windows.go to syscall.go.  The `go generate` command runs fine on any system; the only reason you are using `GOOS=windows` is so that `go generate` will look in syscall_windows.go.\r\n\r\nI agree with the change in this issue--I think `go generate` should pass `GOOS` and `GOARCH` to the child process.  Otherwise there is no simple way to get that information.",
