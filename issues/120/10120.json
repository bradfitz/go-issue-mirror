	"body": "Right now `go get` makes a meta tag request using https first; if this hangs forever, the request times out after 30 seconds before trying the http fallback.\r\n\r\nThis means that a package served from a vanity domain where https requests are dropped can take a long time to install. See this golang-nuts thread for more context:\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/ixF0h1YYCoQ/9wfBu4deaM0J\r\n\r\n@dsymonds suggests that `go get` could kick off the http fallback request after 5s instead of waiting for the full 30s timeout.",
