So the trick is to pass a\npointer to the array instead.  We ought to be able to do that by changing\ngo-reflect-call to 1) use a ffi_type_pointer for a small array, and 2) change the actual\nvalue in the params array so that instead of being a pointer to the array value, it is a\npointer to a pointer to the array value.  Then we also need a similar change for a\nfunction that returns a small array.\n\nAll this assumes that GCC does not simply get fixed, since it appears to currently be\nbroken.\u003c/pre\u003e",
