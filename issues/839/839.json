	"body": "by **jimteeuwen**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003e1. What is a short input program that triggers the error?\nThere is not a particularly short piece of code that will demonstrate this. \nThis seems like a compiler bug which occurs with a combination of certain \ncode constructs (Dealing with struct literals with keys for one).\nIn this case, the error only occurs in combination with a specific import \nstatement (Namely with the use of a . alias).\n\nSee the 2 files attached for the shortest possible reproduction code I \ncould come up with. 'main.go' is the file of interest here. contacts.pb.go \nis simply there for reference because it is the one being imported. \n\nOn IRC, Ian suggested I should file this issue report for it.\n\n\n2. What is the full compiler output?\n6g -o app.6 main.go\nmain.go:30: unknown contacts.AddressBook field 'Person' in struct literal\nmake: *** [all] Error 1\n\n3. What version of the compiler are you using?  (Run it with the -V flag.)\n6g version 5598\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/839/0/main.go\"\u003emain.go\u003c/a\u003e (968 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/839/0/contacts.pb.go\"\u003econtacts.pb.go\u003c/a\u003e (1400 bytes)",
