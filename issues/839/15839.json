	"body": "builtin.go contains the export data for the built-in and unsafe package. It is created by running mkbuiltin.go which runs a special compilation over the sources in the builtin directory and then extracts the export data.\r\n\r\nA change to the export data format requires a careful multi-step process to update the data in builtin.go; see issue #15835.\r\n\r\nInvestigate generation of the builtin and unsafe package export data directly from the source files (they are small). This would eliminate the need for builtin.go and mkbuiltin.go and corresponding tests and make it much easier to play with export format changes.",
