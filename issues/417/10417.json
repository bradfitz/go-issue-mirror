	"body": "**What version of Go are you using (go version)?**\r\n\r\ngo version go1.4.2 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n**What operating system and processor architecture are you using?**\r\n\r\nUbuntu 14.04.1 LTS\r\n\r\n**What did you do?**\r\n\r\n```go\r\nnet.LookupHost(\"1428707955.plus.google.com.\")\r\n```\r\nIn this case DNS resolver doesn't response to queries.\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\n\r\nTimeout error\r\n\r\n**What did you see instead?**\r\n\r\nlookup 1428707955.plus.google.com.: no such host\r\ntimeout: false\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce the problem?**\r\n\r\nThe test conducted uses an iptables rule to drop all inbound DNS responses. And the host used for the test \"X.plus.google.com\" (X = a timestamp) has a wildcard DNS record, so it should exist regardless what \"X\" is.\r\n\r\nTest code and log is available at:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/ashi009/b97db1606258385cc32d\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ sudo apt-get install ngrep\r\n$ git clone https://gist.github.com/b97db1606258385cc32d.git\r\n$ cd b97db1606258385cc32d\r\n$ chmod +x reproduce.sh\r\n$ ./reproduce.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that, this error is also reproducible on `go version go1.4.2 darwin/amd64`, but needs different setup as iptables, strace are not available on mac.",
