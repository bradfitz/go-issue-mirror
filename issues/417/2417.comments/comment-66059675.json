I've been working my way through the tutorials very carefully,\nand that's the first time I've seen that syntax.  I think it's reasonable for people to\nread \"Effective Go\" before reading the language specification.  Hence, there will be\nmany other programmers like me that won't recognize that syntax.  Hence, it's probably\nworth adding a sentence or two to Effective Go mentioning what that syntax is.\u003c/pre\u003e",
