	"body": "I'm just some random irrelevant dude but personally I think recommending not vendoring tests isn't super fair.\r\n\r\nI've found personally that using git submodules is the nicest way to include the deps as well, but then you're stuck with their tests as well. Even if I wasn't using git submodules I don't really want to write scripts to remove the tests etc.\r\n\r\nI know everyone is against renaming ./vendor. I would rather see ./vendor __and__ ./_vendor supported than have to deal with the tainted user experience. Go already has this ad-hoc notion of ./vendor now, so I don't see why the tooling shouldn't be aware of it as well.\r\n\r\nGo added `go generate` to get rid of Makefiles, now I need Makefiles just to use the toolchain. For me one of the biggest selling points of Go, and one I advocate is that it (usually) encourages sameness, this breaks that convention.",
