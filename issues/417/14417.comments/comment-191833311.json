	"body": "@tj, whether git submodules are nicer than checking all the source is very much subjective. There are pros \u0026 cons either way, and people will weigh those differently. But if you prefer submodules yourself, you have to weigh that against the inability to alter what you check in with `+build` tags and the inability to use `go test ./...` indiscriminately. You'll just have to specify which tests you want to run yourself, or configure your codereview or CI system or editor to run the tests you actually care about.",
