But if one doesn't see it as such (and it isn't, because we're commiting the stuff, right?), it is actually task of the vendoring tools, respectively godep or glide, to have an option for removing or tagging tests.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and explanation. Maybe this should be documented somewhere, so people like me don't get all confused. :)\r\n\r\nClosing because you're right. And cudos for not giving in, despite the lengthy discussions! This is why go rocks.",
