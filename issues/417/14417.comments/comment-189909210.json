	"body": "I'm really sorry, maybe I've got the terminology wrong, but I do not understand what you are saying :) \r\n\r\nThe point I'm trying to make is that vendored imports often are not managed by oneself (e.g. gorilla/mux, sqlx, httprouter, ...). Test break sometimes due to the maintainer's fault or due to configuration issues (e.g. missing environment variables). I want to have an option to make testing vendored imports optional, so `go test ./...` does not exit with an error.\r\n\r\nIf I understood correctly, I could add build flags to all `*_test.go` files inside of `/vendor`. But I do not have control over most of the dependencies, as seen in the example above: `google.golang.org/cloud/internal/transport`\r\n\r\nI want my code to be test- and buildable in 2 years as well, this is why I am vendoring all imports.\r\n\r\nPlease don't take this as unwillingness or insult, I am trying to understand how to resolve the issue I described.",
