	"body": "I'm using the vendor directory to avoid problems similar to leftpad, and I assume that this was its intention to begin with.  The problem I'm seeing here is that if my assumption is correct, the vendor directory should be populated by modules that are from external sources and considered to have already been tested and suitable for my use.  So to include them in the './...' pattern simply prolongs the feedback loop for unit tests, which is undesirable, and in the case of 'vendor' probably completely unnecessary.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't think having to augment the installed vendor packages is a clean solution.  But maybe I don't understand Go very well.",
