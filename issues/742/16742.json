	"body": "Now that `context` is part of the standard library in Go 1.7, it would be nice for the tool mentioned in the comment of `context.TODO()` to be available to the public: https://golang.org/pkg/context/#TODO.\r\n\r\nIf this isn't feasible for some reason, I instead propose that this comment be removed, to prevent misleading others who are looking for the same tool:\r\n\r\n\u003e TODO is recognized by static analysis tools that determine whether Contexts are propagated correctly in a program.\r\n\r\n/cc @broady ",
