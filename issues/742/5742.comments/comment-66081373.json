TLS renegotiation is a huge mess.\n\nThat's a pity, although I do understand. It seems we're ending up using\n\u003ca href=\"http://godoc.org/github.com/andelf/go-curl\"\u003ehttp://godoc.org/github.com/andelf/go-curl\u003c/a\u003e which is a) a pretty messy package and b) a\ncgo dependency we could do without.\n\nHave you got a suggestion for a neater way around the issue, by any chance?\u003c/pre\u003e",
