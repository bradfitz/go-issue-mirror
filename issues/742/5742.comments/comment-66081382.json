I may have\nmissed one.\n\nIn general, sites that do this are mistaken and the solution is a hack which is why I've\nresisted doing it. This form of authentication is also broken by triple-handshake\nattacks[1] and the fix for that hasn't gone through the IETF yet.\n\nIt needs careful thought in order to minimise the amount of disruption to the code while\nsupporting these needs.\n\n\n[1] \u003ca href=\"https://secure-resumption.com/\"\u003ehttps://secure-resumption.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
