One is what current implementations do or do not provide atomicity for.  The other is what atomicity guarantees the spec provides.  The former is an interesting question about current implementations, but ultimately not very useful.  The latter is what kind of guarantees we want to provide across all architectures and across all time.  We don't want to commit to anything here, it may be too expensive to provide particular guarantees on some platforms.  The ordering guarantees provided by locks \u0026 channels is all we want to commit to, and is all that is needed for 99% of programs.",
