In fact, the direct inspiration is Haskell's excellent Foreign Function Interface, which includes stable pointers (which refer to an arbitrary Haskell object, and which can then be passed back into Haskell).  The purpose of a handle is not so that C code can manipulate Go objects.  What it _is_ is a way for Go code to wrap a reference to some Go value, such that a later callback from C into Go can use that value.\r\n\r\nThis can be implemented in the runtime more efficiently than in pure Go.  For one, using a deleted handle is use-after free.",
