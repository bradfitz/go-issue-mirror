	"body": "I am receiving this warning `warning: unknown attribute '__gcc_struct__' ignored` when building on Mac (OS 10.9) with go (version 1.4.2). It occurs often and ends up killing the build. Here are some of the files I am seeing this happen with.\r\n\r\n    crypto/x509/root_cgo_darwin.go\r\n    net/cgo_unix.go\r\n    os/user/lookup_unix.go\r\n    issue9026/issue9026.go\r\n    issue8828/trivial.go\r\n\r\nFinally, I see a test failure. I'm thinking they are related, but I don't know how.\r\n\r\n    FAIL\t_/zopt/conda/envs/_test/go/misc/cgo/test [build failed]\r\n\r\nFWIW, I don't see this error when building on Linux (CentOS 6.3). As this version of Mac uses `clang`, I am wondering if that has something to do with the issue. Is there someway for me to suppress this build warning?",
