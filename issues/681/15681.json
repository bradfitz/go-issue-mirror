	"body": "From a quick scan of the code, it appears that cgo does not depend on a package's dependencies having been compiled. Given that that is the case, and given that cgo (and the resulting C compiler invocations) are generally very slow, it is probably worth scheduling all invocations of cmd/cgo at the very beginning of a build. (As a corollary, this might also mean scheduling the compilation of cmd/cgo itself early.)\r\n\r\ncc @ianlancetaylor for input about whether cgo invocations can be safely pushed to the head of the queue.\r\n\r\nOne downside: It is unclear whether this is just a poor man's version of #8893, which didn't appear to yield much fruit. That could use more investigation.\r\n",
