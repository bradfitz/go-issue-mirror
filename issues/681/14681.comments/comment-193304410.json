The code in question is running on a couple dozen machines serving thousands if not millions of requests a day that run this code path and I have seen the crash happen only once in the last 5 days or so.\r\n\r\nThe codebase this happens in is quite extensive but the basic flow is something like:\r\nRun http.ListenAndServe\r\nHandle request -\u003e connect to database\r\nHandle new request -\u003e build prepared statement, defer statement close, execute statement (one or multiple times), defer Rows close return data (and thus execute defered functions). All of this happens within one function.",
