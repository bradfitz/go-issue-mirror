(__open64_2 is used for calls to\nopen passing two arguments rather than 3 when _FILE_OFFSET_BITS is defined to 64, as it\nis in the Go sources in include/u.h.)\n\nIncidentally 6g compiled on my system actually requires glibc 2.14, because in glibc\n2.14 memcpy was changed to do backward copying in some cases, and that broke some\napplications.\u003c/pre\u003e",
