	"body": "x509 certificate verification currently fails for requests that specifies a port, unless the common name pattern in the certificate has the same port specified. \r\n\r\nI think this is too strict. If the pattern doesn't have a port, I think the verification should pass for all requests to that host, regardless of port.\r\n\r\nRelevant code: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/x509/verify.go#L414\r\n\r\n\r\n",
