Yes, 2003/XP -64bit does have a AddVectoredContinueHandler API. \r\n\r\nIf a don't disable Windows Error Reporting dialog, then the 1.4.2 behavior is restored: the dialog is displayed, but the dump is also displayed. I presume there is a bug in this version where the continue handler is not called if the dialog is not displayed.\r\n\r\nOne option would be to detect the Windows version number and not use the AddVectoredContinueHandler in amd64 2003/XP as it appears to have a bug.\r\n\r\n-Daniel\r\n",
