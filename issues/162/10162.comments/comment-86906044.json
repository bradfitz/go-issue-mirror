Do you mean that the program above prints stack trace if compiled with go.1,4,2, but prints nothing with current tip? I suspect it prints nothing with any version.\r\n\r\nI think it is the way your Windows works. Does your Windows have AddVectoredContinueHandler API (see os_init function)? Perhaps it is environment combination I didn't see before: amd64 and no AddVectoredContinueHandler. Perhaps that combination does not work with current code as it is written.\r\n\r\nAlex",
