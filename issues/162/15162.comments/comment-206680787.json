Conventional\r\nimport path rewriting (if not used with internal package) allows direct\r\nimporting.\r\n\r\nI agree with that logic. However, this introduces yet another decision that a newcomer has to make -- code has been placed in `vendor/` and it now can be imported by it's full import path, or by the alias that the go tool provides via the vendor logic. This adds more choice and more confusion. I don't see this as an answer, because the root cause of all of these problems is code which used to have exactly one name in the import graph now has more than one, so type equality is busted.\r\n",
