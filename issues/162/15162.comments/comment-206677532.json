	"body": "I don't think this proposal is making the situation much complicated.\n\nIt actually makes the situation simpler to explain, please see all the\nissues that complains about path/to/pkgA/vendor/pkgB import paths\nfrom `go list` or reflect PkgPath. If we implement this, vendor is just\na way to rewrite import paths (without actually rewriting them in the\nsource code) and internal package is about controlling visibility of\npackages.\n\nPut it another way, if vendoring is just a form of import path rewriting,\nwhy you can't directly import that rewritten package? Conventional\nimport path rewriting (if not used with internal package) allows direct\nimporting.\n\nAny solution to the etcd problem will ultimately require all the packages\nto agree on a (possibly) vendored context package to use (for example,\nby hoisting the vendored context package to top-level). This is a solution\nthat requires the least cooperation from the upstream.\n",
