The intent is to give you some relatively accurate\nrecord of memory use over time, rather than letting you know too-late that\nyou're in a bad way, and you would use this interface to control how much\nwork you allowed into your server, and/or would modify the amount of memory\noverhead (indirectly, the GC rate).\n\nOn Jul 9, 2016 2:37 PM, \"rgooch\" \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\nIf I could get a recoverable panic when memory use hits a pre-defined\nlimit, that would help.
