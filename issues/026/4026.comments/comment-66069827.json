Thinking because of it now again,\nwhat I would actually like to use is the sharing intents lock, which I think doesn't\nsuffer from the deadlock problem. See:\n\u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_granularity_locking\"\u003ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_granularity_locking\u003c/a\u003e\n\nAFAICS, RWMutex is a subset of a MGL when/where S==R and X==W. I think the MGL is not a\nterribly complicated state machine and I guess it's feasible to hack it on top of\nexisting primitives. Still it's not trivial to code (and test!) properly, so having a\nreliable, ready made solution in the stdlib would be IMO pretty reasonable.\u003c/pre\u003e",
