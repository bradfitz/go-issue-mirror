It just\nenables the promotion in a deadlock free way *and* preserves (the protected by MGL)\nstate while promoting/waiting for promotion. The later is IMO actually the important\nproperty.\n\nA real life anti-example of where I could use it:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/cznic/strutil/blob/master/strutil.go#L261\"\u003ehttps://github.com/cznic/strutil/blob/master/strutil.go#L261\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\"Anti\" because here it would make code simpler - but slower on average. So MGL *can*\nmake for poor code. OTOH, the state consistency may be priceless elsewhere or even the\nsolution enabling condition.\n\nOn the locking table: at the second look I now don't understand it either. Maybe R is\nnot S but actually IS and where I wrote SIX there should be IX instead. Also, then I\nwould have to unlearn what I thought for years SIX is. Confused now (myself B-)\u003c/pre\u003e",
