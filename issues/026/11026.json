	"body": "The interface for the compress/bzip2 subpackage is currently\r\n```\r\nfunc NewReader(r io.Reader) io.Reader\r\n```\r\nNote it does not return any error data - in fact you can't tell if it's going to read the file until you actually try to read. Contrast to the gzip subpackage:\r\n```\r\nfunc NewReader(r io.Reader) (*Reader, error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks from the current state of things that its not been decided which direction the compression code wants to go with its interfaces, but IMHO favoring an early error return would be better.",
