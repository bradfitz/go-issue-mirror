The argument to go get is an import path.\nThe common case where the import path matches a well-known repo (e.g. github) is handled\nto make things smoother, but it still remains that the argument is an import path, not a\nURL.\n\nI agree it would be neat if it \"just worked\", but it's not hard to\n  cd $GOPATH/src\n  hg clone ssh://myhg.com//abs/path/to/repo\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-someday**, **toolchange**, removed **priority-triage**, **go1.2maybe**._",
