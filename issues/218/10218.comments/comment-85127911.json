	"body": "I never decided when to freeze the method signatures of the gl package. It definitely should be frozen by the time Go 1.5 comes out. But I suppose it is still safe to change some, as long as nothing breaks silently.\r\n\r\n- BufferData change looks good.\r\n- s/Gen/Create/ is OK. Create is a better word.\r\n- I'm not really interested enough in exactly matching WebGL to change Get{Shader,Program}i to Get{Shader,Program}Parameteri. Seems unnecessarily wordy, and the names are clear enough.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to send CLs for the first two, please do. Update any call references to them in the mobile repo please.",
