I'd have to convince that package owner that they should remove vendoring, or maintain my own fork.\r\n\r\nDo we agree that what I described earlier should not occur? Should the build tool resolve vendor/foo/bar/a for package vendor/fizz/buzz/b, when b itsself has been vendored into another project (what I was describing as deep vendoring)?",
