	"body": "@rsc, I actually agree with how the vendor mechanism works, and am planning on trying to move it into the go/build package so that external tools can utilize it. However, the thread above shows a case where \"deep vendoring\" breaks a build. I believe you said in the thread that this behavior should not exist.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm describing is the following structure:\r\n```\r\nlocal/project\r\n    vendor/foo/bar/a\r\n    vendor/fizz/buzz/b\r\n        vendor/foo/bar/a\r\n```\r\nA test project shows that given foo imports both a and b, and turn b imports its own vendored version of a, the build breaks.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my suggestion for pushing back the default (1.6) milestone is a bit hasty. But at the least I am suggesting that this case of \"deep vendoring\" be addressed before removing the GO15VENDOREXPIRIMENT variable (as of now, slated for Go 1.7)\r\n\r\nEDIT: my concern is not having the ability to turn vendoring OFF in this situation, as described in Go 1.7",
