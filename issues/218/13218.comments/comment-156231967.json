	"body": "Re opt-out: Anyone can turn vendoring off by renaming the directory they have named \"vendor\" that doesn't mean \"vendor, as described in the vendoring proposal\" to any other string. Renaming will work for this purpose forever, certainly beyond Go 1.7. That is what we want people to do. We do _not_ want people to change the environment variable depending on what code base they work on. It's bad enough that people have to do this for the Go 1.5 release. The goal is to get people moved over to the new meaning (and again that might mean some people renaming some directories to avoid the new meaning) and back to a state where everyone's tools behave the same way.\r\n\r\nRe build breakage, I will reply again on the thread about that. I want to keep that conversation off this issue. It's not a bug.\r\n",
