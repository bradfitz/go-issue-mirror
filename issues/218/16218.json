	"body": "We currently have the startings of a nice DNS parsing and packing library in net/dnsmsg.go. This is useful for building custom DNS clients and servers in Go, but is not currently exported. I would like to propose moving this functionality to x/net/dns and vendoring it so that the same version can be used in the net package.",
