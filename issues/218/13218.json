	"body": "Given the conversations taking place (eg https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/WebP4dLV1b0), I propose pushing the milestones for the vendor experiment back a release until more of a consensus can be reached.\r\n\r\nAs described in the thread above, there will be certain situations in which a build will break by default in 1.6 Furthermore, by Go 1.7, the default will force the vendor option and cannot be turned off (https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/go/pkg.go#L255), which will prevent any chance of a fix for a breaking build as a result of the vendor functionality.\r\n\r\nRather than rush a change of behavior, let's push back both milestones for the vendor experiment by 1 release. Go 1.6 will behave as before. Go 1.7 will have vendor on by default.\r\n\r\nWith this time we have time to find a solution that will hopefully allow for the vendor feature to never fully break a build and or allow vendoring to be disabled \u003e= Go 1.8.",
