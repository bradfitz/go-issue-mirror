The current dnsmsg API could then be implemented on top of that, while package net could use it directly.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to how djbdns's client library is implemented: a low-level abstraction for treating packets as sequences of packed names and raw byte strings (used by djbdns's dnscache server), and a higher-level abstraction that understands the encoding of different RR formats (intended for use by end user applications).",
