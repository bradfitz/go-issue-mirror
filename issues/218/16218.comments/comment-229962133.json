EDNS0, DNSSEC, etc. etc. Just exposing the parsing bits from std lib covers a fraction of the spec - but I can see it being useful for some people.\r\n\r\nAs for incrementally walking a message - there is no support for that in the `miekg/dns` although I'm happy to take patches for that.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering about this feature request in the first place. Is the only reason for it to *not* depend on the 3rd party package?",
