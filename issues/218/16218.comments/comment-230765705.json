I think I can promise that whatever they come up with, if anything, will be more complex and harder to understand than the CLA.\r\n\r\nI can understand a refusal to sign anything.  But if someone is willing to sign something, the CLA is not that hard to understand and is about as minimal as possible for this kind of document.  It asserts that the signer has a legal right to distribute the code, and grants Google the same right.",
