The result is an (expected) compilation error:\r\n\r\n    # _/home/vagrant/go/test/bug4\r\n    ./crazylib1.go:3: undefined: s\r\n    ./crazylib1.go:10006: undefined: s\r\n\r\nFixing the obvious error (= instead of :=), the file compiles fine.\r\n\r\nSo it seems the conversion of the compiler to Go fixed the stack overflow issue.\r\nI think this issue can now be closed.\r\n",
