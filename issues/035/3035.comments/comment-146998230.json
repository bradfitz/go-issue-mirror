I have a JSON file that contains a database of terminals -- this file could be compiled into the Go program, but its really extension info, and adding it bloats the text of the program by some 2MB at run time.  Since only about 0.1% of users need it, its better to leave it in JSON.\r\n\r\nIdeally, go install could be made to install these resource files (perhaps by having a special file list what they are) in a standard directory based on the location of the binary, and then a little API glue to support picking the file up by the package name  \u0026 binary location?\r\n\r\nAbsent this, I'm inclined to use $HOME/.\u003cpackagename\u003e and hope for the best.
