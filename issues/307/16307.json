	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.6.2 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"darwin\"\r\nGOOS=\"darwin\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/Users/andrew/code/myriad\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/usr/local/go\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/darwin_amd64\"\r\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\"1\"\r\nCC=\"clang\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fno-caret-diagnostics -Qunused-arguments -fmessage-length=0 -fno-common\"\r\nCXX=\"clang++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nUnfortunately, this error requires multiple files to reproduce. the description should suffice, tho.\r\n\r\ni use yacc and nex as part of a package. the generated code lives in another package\r\n(so that generated code is not mixed in with source-controlled code).\r\noccasionally, a mistake is made in my parse.y so that the generated parse.go causes an import cycle.\r\nat this point, i can't simply correct parse.y (to not have the import cycle), because go generate\r\nwon't run the generate commands because (apparently) it processes the import directives first.\r\n\r\ni observe that \"go generate --help\" says, in part, \r\n             Note that go generate does not parse the file, so lines that look\r\n            like directives in comments or multiline strings will be treated\r\n             as directives.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\ni would expect go generate to run the command and not worry about an import cycle.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\ngo generate determines (correctly but irrelevantly) that there is an import cycle and does not run the generate commands.\r\n",
