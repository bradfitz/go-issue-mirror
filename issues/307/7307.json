	"body": "by **thomas.e.zander**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. See \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/XMTOGXKuIR\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/XMTOGXKuIR\u003c/a\u003e\n2. Execute the program locally (you need /bin/ls and a file system tree)\n3. Program crashes in \u0026gt;90% of all cases\n4. If you hit one of the cases in which it did not crash, jump to 3.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nNo output, just exiting with return code 0 at some point.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nAll kinds of runtime panics, stack traces etc, for instance the attached one.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nFreeBSD-10 amd64\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.2 freebsd/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nProblem seems to be triggered by setting runtime.GOMAXPROCS. Commenting out the line in\ngiven example program makes it run stable.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/7307/0/errlog.txt\"\u003eerrlog.txt\u003c/a\u003e (23862 bytes)",
