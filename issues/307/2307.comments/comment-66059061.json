It looks like the fix is to not use\nSO_REUSEADDR, but only on Windows.  On other systems\nit works just fine and does what it is supposed to do.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms740621(v=vs.85).aspx\"\u003ehttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms740621(v=vs.85).aspx\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\"The SO_REUSEADDR socket option allows a socket to forcibly bind to a\nport in use by another socket. The second socket calls setsockopt with\nthe optname parameter set to SO_REUSEADDR and the optval parameter set\nto a boolean value of TRUE before calling bind on the same port as the\noriginal socket. Once the second socket has successfully bound, the\nbehavior for all sockets bound to that port is indeterminate. For\nexample, if all of the sockets on the same port provide TCP service,\nany incoming TCP connection requests over the port cannot be\nguaranteed to be handled by the correct socket â€” the behavior is\nnon-deterministic. A malicious program can use SO_REUSEADDR to\nforcibly bind sockets already in use for standard network protocol\nservices in order to deny access to those service. No special\nprivileges are required to use this option.\"\n\nWTF.\u003c/pre\u003e",
