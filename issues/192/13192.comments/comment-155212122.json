The errors are the same or similar if I try to do the same build without your patches on ppc64.\r\n\r\nYou are correct, the point of this issue is to document the errors that I've seen with external linking on ppc64.  I used your patches in my testing just because they are the latest changes I'm aware of for linking on Power.  I understand you are not promising to make it work for ppc64, but I'm trying to understand how much is missing from external linking for ppc64.",
