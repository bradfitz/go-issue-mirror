	"body": "Issue 2: yes, it looks like there are cases where we should perform the op on the copy instead of the original.  I'll have to think about how to detect when that is beneficial.\r\nIssue 3: Even before doing things like OR AX, (BX), we also would want OR (BX), AX.  The problem is on amd64 there are a ton of possible instructions you could potentially want, including all the ops times all the addressing modes.  So although I think it would be easy to handle this particular case, doing it generally would be a large maintenance burden.\r\nIssue 5 : should be an easy rule fix.\r\nIssue 7: I think this is #14761.\r\n\r\n",
