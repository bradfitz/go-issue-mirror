We just need to convert the prose there into function names. I would like to bikeshed on those function names later, ok?\r\n\r\nWhat I need to know now is: \r\n\r\n- Do you guys feel the pain too? \r\n- Do you agree to the basic idea of the cure? \r\n- Do you suggest a wildly different road here? Which one?",
