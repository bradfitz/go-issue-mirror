I haven't found any test cases that it fails on (e.g., \"ONE\", \"ONE TWO\", \"ONE TWO TWO\", and \"ONE {} TWO\" all produce correct default actions now), so it's at least no worse than the status quo.  But the code isn't very easy to comprehend, so I'm not confident that I haven't overlooked some corner case.",
