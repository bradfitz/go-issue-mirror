I have a source file inside $GOPATH/src/github.com/pandeya/hello/hello.go\r\n\r\nWhen I run command \"go install hello.go\" in hello directory, I get the above mentioned error message\r\n\r\ngo install: no install location for .go files listed on command line (GOBIN not set)\r\n\r\nI can run the program using \"go run hello.go\" properly.\r\n\r\nI understand that if I have GOPATH correctly set, i don't need to set GOBIN.\r\n\r\nAm I missing anything?\r\n\r\nI am running OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 with go1.4.2 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\nThanks.",
