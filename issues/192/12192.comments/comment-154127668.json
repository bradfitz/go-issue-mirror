I'm sorry we don't have a better way to pin down exactly what part of your program causes it, but the usual suspects are uses of unsafe, uses of cgo, uses of unsafe and cgo together, and data races.\n\nAt the least we need you to make `go test -race` work for your code before we can start looking for runtime bugs.\n\nThanks.",
