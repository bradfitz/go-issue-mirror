The CL just adds: \"... is implementation-defined\". And that is fair\nenough. But we still need to document somewhere what these rules are, even if they can\nchange in the future. We have plenty of code that uses unsafe.Pointer inside main repo -\nwho is to say if that code is correct. What about outside external packages? If you\ndon't have answers to this questions, that is OK too. But lets reopen the issue.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
