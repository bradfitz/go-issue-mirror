I originally opened the\nissue because the current state is confusing, and that remains the case.  I think we\nshould either reopen this issue as a non-spec issue, or open a new one.\n\nThis is related to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/8310\"\u003eissue #8310\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e",
