	"body": "There are very few types for which this is a fundamental question, and vet already knows about them. For others, well, if you create a type that can't be copied, you can usually construct the API so that it won't be copied by accident. The remaining cases are rare enough that putting a check for them into a tool everyone uses daily isn't worth the cost. Vet must remain fast enough for everyone and we need to curate its test suite.\r\n\r\nAt a more personal level, I fear that once we start annotating our programs with hints for heuristic tools, our programs become uglier. Then the floodgates will be open and the ugliness will soak the land. I lived through the lint era. We do not want to go back there; it was a soggy mess.\r\n\r\nSo as a proposal for vet, I say strongly, \"no\". \r\n\r\nI would like to close this issue at least as far as vet is concerned. (The original issue is about the runtime, and although I feel strongly there too, I will let someone else decide how to respond to the original question.) I will compensate by providing a proper README for vet that explains the criteria used to gate additions to its suite.\r\n",
