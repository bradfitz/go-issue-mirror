Which is to say that we already have a mechanism for this--it's a method rather than a comment, a struct field, etc.\r\n\r\nOf the new mechanisms proposed, a comment seems the least invasive. (struct{} fields are not no-ops, despite appearances to the contrary, nor are struct tags.) If the problem with comments is that they don't make it into the export data, perhaps we could add directive-y comments into the export data.\r\n\r\nI still don't quite understand the case for this check being in the compiler instead of vet or for a language change. There are lots of unsafe things one can do with the language, and vet, the race detector, and other tools help on that front. I don't see why this is different.\r\n",
