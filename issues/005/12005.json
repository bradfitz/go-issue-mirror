Also, \"Exported identifiers\" maybe more aligned with other material.  \r\n \r\nThis made me think \"ok... I understand what it looks like, but what does this exported name do?\".\r\n \r\nOne sentence like \"exported names can be accessed from another package, while unexported names remains local\".",
