	"body": "I was joking to David that we should have a slider knob on godoc to choose how much crap in a package we show.\r\n\r\nImagine if a user loaded the net package and they only saw `Dial` and `Listen` and `Conn` by default, but then had to do something to show all the noise.\r\n\r\nI'm kinda joking, but kinda not. Maybe there's something to do here.\r\n\r\nWe've tried to address this in the past with package docs and examples, which helps, but also just adds to the overall noise.\r\n\r\nLow priority.\r\n\r\n/cc @adg \r\n",
