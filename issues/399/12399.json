Then I realized that on the left, codesearch referred to `google3/releasetools/rpdb/common/codesearch` while on the right it referred to `google3/social/automation/tools/actuators/codesearch`.\r\n\r\nWhen the short package names are the same, the long name should be used in this \"is not assignable\" error message, as is done in other cases.",
