I would\nexpect \u0026quot;literal\u0026quot; to imply that every time the line containing the \u0026amp; is\nexecuted, a pointer to the same struct is returned.\n\nA sentence appropriate to the context which better represents my current understanding\nof how Go operates would be:\n\n\u0026quot;The special prefix \u0026amp; constructs a pointer to the newly allocated struct.\u0026quot;\n\nBelow is an example illustrating the difference in behavior between what golang does and\nwhat the current wording leads me to expect.\n\n\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/7SvvJ7sonN\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/7SvvJ7sonN\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n(Just to reiterate:  I don't actually \u0026quot;expect\u0026quot; this output, this is just what\nthe documentation on tour.golang.org led me to expect; I am filing a bug because I\nbelieve the documentation, not the go compiler, is at fault.)\n\u0026amp;{999} \u0026amp;{999}\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\u0026amp;{1} \u0026amp;{999}\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nI'm just using play.golang.org.\u003c/pre\u003e",
