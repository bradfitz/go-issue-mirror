I'm complaining about the phrase\n\"pointer to a struct literal\" because \"literal\" should refer to the syntax, whereas it's\nbeing used here to refer to the object that was constructed by the syntax.\n\nMy suggestion is to change the one sentence \"The special prefix \u0026 â€¦\" so that it reads\n\"The special prefix \u0026 constructs a pointer to the newly allocated struct.\"  The rest of\nthe tour is fine.\u003c/pre\u003e",
