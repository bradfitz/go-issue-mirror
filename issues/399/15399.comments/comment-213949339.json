	"body": "The purpose of the `html/template` package is to avoid human error. If all XSS situations would be \"obviously not safe\", then we could all just use `text/template` instead of `html/template`. But I think everyone agrees that this is not the case, that it is better to make the machine ensure safety than a human.\r\n\r\nWe had this XSS vulnerability in our product. I wasn't the author, but I have to admit that if I would have reviewed this code, I would not have spotted this vulnerability. Right now I would, but that is because now I **know** about the \"string contents can be dangerous\" fact. Still, I think this fact is not intuitive and thus has a high risk of human error if the same situation has not been experienced in the past. It would be in the spirit of the `html/template` package to reduce that risk, either by extending the safety that the machine can check or at least actively passing that knowledge via documentation.",
