	"body": "@dgryski, that's a bit of it, but it's looking like the actual problem is that filepath.Walk does a Readdirnames followed by a bunch of Stat calls on each to figure out what's a directory, when the underlying kernel interface supports telling you which are directories in the same call where you read the names, but Go doesn't take advantage of that on Unix platforms. (And `path/filepath` could do that on Windows, which Go's `syscall` and `os` package already supports, but it hard-codes the use of `Readdirnames`)",
