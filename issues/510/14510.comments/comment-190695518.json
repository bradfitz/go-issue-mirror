	"body": "You can't use `structured error information` e.g. ` struct that returns a integer code and the error details etc in case of error, or nil in case of success` because gomobile strictly forbids using anything else than `error` interface as second parameter.\r\n\r\n\u003e gomobile: functions and methods must return either zero or one values, and optionally an error\r\n\r\nWhat could easily work is to allow some kind of special error struct e.g. `type GomobileError struct { Code int }` the same way as for example we have https://golang.org/pkg/net/#DNSConfigError\r\nHowever, making a generic like above doesn't work in this case IMO as android exceptions doesn't have error codes.\r\n\r\nSo maybe back to the root of the problem. Right now it's impossible to match errors between golang code and ios/android in some systematic way. In golang for example we can check if package exported error pointer is the same as returned error or by using type assertion. When it comes to matching errors between golang and ios/android we can only base on error message... which is at least ugly.",
