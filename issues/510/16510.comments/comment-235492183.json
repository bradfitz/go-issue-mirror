	"body": "\u003e Reading the data or not by the handler should not be concerned by connection level, it is stream level issue. Please comment what potential issues you can think of with that patch.\r\n\r\nThe problem with immediately returning all conn-level flow control is that it then means you can buffer up to SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS * SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE bytes, rather than the value of the connection-level flow control.\r\n\r\nIn your view, what is the purpose of the connection-level flow control if you don't think there should be any pushback on it? As implemented, if handlers don't read data, things are buffered until the flow control limits, and WINDOW_UPDATE isn't refreshed, creating pushback to the peer to stop sending. With your patch, you ignore all connection-level flow control and have no pushback, meaning that only stream-level flow control is enforced.\r\n\r\nThe reason I said it's a question of defaults is because we likely need a larger connection-level flow window.\r\n\r\nSince you want to retitle this bug, I opened #16512 for investigating the flow control values.",
