You're really not speaking HTTP anymore,\nand it is unclear that these kinds of helpers for this non-HTTP protocol\nbelong in the HTTP library.  As soon as there is a proxy in the middle\nthe semantics of your server break badly.\n\nSince the client has to know about this magic anyway, it seems\ncleaner to hijack the connection and switch to a simpler custom\nprotocol.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
