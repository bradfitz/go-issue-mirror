It's knowing when the connection drops that\nis important when doing expensive things. I need to cancel those\nexpensive things if the connection drops.\n\nThat doesn't mean I'm no longer speaking HTTP. It's that in a lot of\ncases, I don't know what the proper status code is until the expensive\nwork has completed in some way.\n\nFor example:\n\n     go func() {\n        errCh \u0026lt;- somethingLongRunning(closedCh)\n     }()\n\n     select {\n     case err := \u0026lt;-errCh:\n       if err != nil {\n         http.Error(w, err.String(), 500);\n       }\n     }\n\nIf I have to Hijack, I can no longer use anything convenient in the\nhttp package, even though I'm still speaking HTTP, because they all\ntake the http.ResponseWriter, or are on it; and that is now rejecting\nall calls to any method.\n\n-b\u003c/pre\u003e",
