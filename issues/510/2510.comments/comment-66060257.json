The problem, well, inconvenience, comes\nwhen I can no longer take advantage of all the work the underlying\nobject of http.ResponseWriter was doing because it no longer allows\nwrites after a hijacking.  I find myself copy and pasting \u0026lt;ducks\u0026gt; code\nfrom Go's src (i.e. WriteHeader).\n\nOne way around this is to factor out the convenience methods into a public API.\u003c/pre\u003e",
