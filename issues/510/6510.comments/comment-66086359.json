But, I am sure, it can be done.\n\n\u003e ... We are talking at least 10 calls into the windows api before we get an opengl\ncontext.\n\nSo what. Just a longer test.\n\n\u003e That test DLL has no prereqs.\n\nI have no problems with your dll. But calling \"official\" dll makes it more \"beleivable\"\nfor me. gcc, probably, generates \"correct\" code, but why use that if we have \"real\"\nthing.\n\n\u003e ... They were all drawing calls (in gdi32) ...\n\nLike I said before, I don't see a problem with these.\n\n\u003e windows 386 however appears to return floats in the x87 regs. I don't think the\ncurrent syscall funcs can be used for funcs that return floats.\n\nWhat about r2 in\n\nfunc Syscall(trap, nargs, a1, a2, a3 uintptr) (r1, r2 uintptr, err Errno)\n\n? We don't use r2 at the moment. Can it be used here?\n\n\u003e Might just be time to give in and go the cgo way.\n\nYour call if you want to push this.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
