Don't say that it's this way for 3 years.\nYes, the data misses these conversions.\n\nI think that the skew affects only iface/{embed, nil, small, heap} values. So the\nfollowing calculations are still correct.\n\nThe iface/alloc is the number of allocations due to copyin; malloc tab shows total\nnumber of allocations in the same program; heap/iface/eface show number of ifaces in\nheap during GC. These numbers must be enough to draw conclusions.\nFor example on garbage-amd64 benchmark heap is ~62MB; heap contains ~10M iface/efaces\nwhich is 16MB today. If we increase sizeof iface/eface to 3 words, that will increase\nheap size by 13%.\u003c/pre\u003e",
