You are not seeing the \"not a pointer but looks a pointer value\" because\nthose are all missing. You're only seeing int16/int8 and maybe some operations coming\nfrom reflect, and yes, very few of them look like a pointer. But the inlined ones may be\nvery different.\n\nI think you need to run the numbers again without inlining of these operations enabled.\u003c/pre\u003e",
