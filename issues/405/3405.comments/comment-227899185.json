Is this something that needs to be a part of the standard library? There was even a pure go implementation of a seccomp package (https://github.com/docker/libcontainer/pull/613/files), but the problem with that is constantly having to stay in sync with libseccomp and the kernel. So I guess I'm wondering what the goal is here? Because I'm willing to help.",
