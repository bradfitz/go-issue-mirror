I can have a program with two goroutines that communicate using a system\npipe (horror). This program would end up in a deadlock if restricted to a single thread.\nThe read/write system calls on the pipe have to be made simultaneously from different\nthreads for the goroutines to make progress.\n\nI have updated the draft based on the feedback above. The new version is here:\n\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nh1hub2wJdYzoLVUkCPS7MoUIFRZRP5PbrtOO0WajII/pub\"\u003ehttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1nh1hub2wJdYzoLVUkCPS7MoUIFRZRP5PbrtOO0WajII/pub\u003c/a\u003e\n\nPlease take another look.\u003c/pre\u003e",
