	"body": "The fix is at https://golang.org/cl/25010, which addressed both sides:\r\n\r\n* the http.Transport will no longer respect the HTTP_PROXY environment variable if it appears that we're running in a CGI environment. This is similar to this fix from @gisle in 2001: http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.libwww/2001/03/msg2249.html Props to @RandalSchwartz and @gisle for beating us all to the fix by 15 years and not giving it a marketing website?\r\n\r\n* the CGI Host implementation will stop setting HTTP_PROXY to protect others. There's now no way to get at the \"Proxy\" request header if anybody was depending on it. Oh well?\r\n\r\nSadly, in a past life I wrote and maintained http://search.cpan.org/~bradfitz/LWPx-ParanoidAgent/lib/LWPx/ParanoidAgent.pm to protect against attacks like this bug, but never considered this case :( ",
