	"body": "Thanks.  I don't think there is any swig problem here.  The problem is cgo.  cgo is generating the file WORKDIR/WORKDIRNAME_FILE.cgo1.go where WORKDIRNAME is WORKDIR with the slashes replaced by underscores.  When WORKDIR is long, as it often is, the resulting file name is quite long.  One way to fix this is to have cmd/go pass a -srcdir option to cmd/cgo, which will cause WORKDIRNAME to contain just the file name, which is all we really need anyhow.",
