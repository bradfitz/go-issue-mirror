It's hard for\nme to believe that lldb doesn't support DWARF 2.\n\nCertainly one problem here is that decent gdb support requires\npkg/runtime/runtime-gdb.py, which lldb presumably does not understand.  lldb does have\nits own Python interface, but I don't know how similar it is to the gdb interface.\u003c/pre\u003e",
