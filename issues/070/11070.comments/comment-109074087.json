At least that's what I assume is going on.\r\n\r\nThe \"fix\" in consul seems to be to compress the response, bringing it below 512 bytes but it is perfectly valid to have bigger responses and all major resolvers are supporting that by implementing EDNS or fall back to tcp and I think netgo is doing this as well, right?\r\n\r\nPossible that consul is returning a malformed response that most resolvers still manage to parse but netgo is too strict. But then the error could be probably improved.\r\n\r\nPS: @bradfitz Yes fixed, was a bit in a rush ;)",
