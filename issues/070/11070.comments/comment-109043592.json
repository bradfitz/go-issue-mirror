Please don't mix two issues together.\r\n\r\nFor the \"cannot unmarshal DNS message\" error, as described in hashicorp/consul#854, builtin DNS stub resolver in go1.4 and above are more RFC 1035 compliant than go1.3 and below. I'm not sure what we should do when the recursor stuff (I guess it's a recursive server) replies a long response message on UDP transport.\r\n\r\nThe \"no such host\" error; builtin DNS stub resolver with search? domain? both? issue looks pretty interesting. A few possibilities come to my mind, but not sure without any concrete information. Please provide, a) DNS RR sets for your target alias or canonical name, b) your stub resolver configuration (usually resolv.conf), c) your recursive DNS server configuration, into a new issue. It would be a great help If you can provide the environment for repro. Thanks.",
