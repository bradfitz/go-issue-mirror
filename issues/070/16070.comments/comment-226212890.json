	"body": "Yes, this is a known limitation of maps.  Once overflow buckets are allocated, they are not freed (until the map grows, which doesn't happen in your test).  Given lots of inserts and deletes, you'll eventually get an overflow bucket or two for each main bucket.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to figure out a way to fix this.  Deleting overflow buckets is tricky in the presence of iterators.",
