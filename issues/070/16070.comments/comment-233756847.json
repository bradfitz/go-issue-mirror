Expect an R=go1.8 early feedback CL soon.\r\n\r\nI'm using a [slightly modified version of the original code](https://gist.github.com/josharian/4a2de31782072378a2995bffd2d0ff24/revisions) that generates less irrelevant garbage and runs `runtime.GC` before printing mem stats to provide more stable output.\r\n\r\n@rhysh some folks vaguely remembered that you might have expressed an interest in working on this problem at GopherCon. If so, I'd be interested to get your take on the CL. If not, apologies for the noise.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
