I plan to merge the 8 and 6\narchitecture definitions at some point, and that will take care of that. But we haven't\ndone that. If it were important we could use BYTE directives to get at those. \n\nThe only function provided by the SSE2 instruction set, which is the floating point we\nuse for 6g, is Sqrt, perhaps because it is much easier for hardware to compute than the\ntrig functions. Although Intel claims the x87 trig instructions are okay to 2^63, in\npractice they're not even great at that big. If nothing else, Cos(2^1000) would require\n1050 or so bits of pi for argument reduction.\n\nThe real question is: do we care more about using the machine instruction or about\ncorrectness? We can't have both. (Of course, right now on 6g we have neither. But the\nanswer would tell us which to fix.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
