	"body": "There is, as far as I can tell, no method for sending a PING frame to an open HTTP/2 connection right now. While in most cases there is no direct need to send PING frames, I've encountered multiple cases where it's important, lest you discard the connection and recreate it:\r\n\r\n* [Apple's APNs][apns] HTTP/2 API is picky about what it receives and only supports PING frames as a way to ensure a healthy connection. Sending dummy requests may get your connection closed.\r\n* Go's HTTP/2 lib chokes on idle sockets on Google Compute Engine VMs (see #14607 for some info). If the socket happens to be an HTTP/2 connection (which it often is in my case), being able to send PING frames would be a viable workaround for this issue.\r\n* [Amazon's AVS HTTP/2 API][avs] expects a PING frame at least once per 10 minutes and it should be possible to send them. (Luckily, there's a workaround to call `/ping` in this case.)\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion is to somehow expose a way to send PING frames.\r\n\r\n[apns]: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/APNsProviderAPI.html\r\n[avs]: https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service",
