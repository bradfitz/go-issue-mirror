(run 'go version')\ngo1.1.2\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThe spec mentions auto-referencing/dereferencing the x in method value expression x.M as\nnecessary so that it matches the kind of receiver M has, which is why the call to tFn is\nexpected to print 1. It doesn't mention resolving x to the value that will ultimately\nused to initialize the receiver-parameter visible in the body of the method M. Instead,\nit says that x is evaluated and saved to be used as the receiver. Note that receiver has\nmultiple meanings used in the spec, depending on whether you're talking about the\nreceiver-argument or the receiver-parameter.\n\nDepending on the intended behaviour, this may also be a compiler bug.\u003c/pre\u003e",
