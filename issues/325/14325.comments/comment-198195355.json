Even Francesc's post points out that this kind of microbenchmark is likely misleading. Any real loop is going to have possible calculations that can cause it to panic, aborting the loop early. You don't want to be left with an enormous piece of unnecessary garbage in that case. And to the extent that you might underallocate during an append loop, you shoot yourself in the foot by breaking the guarantees of append, for example when that loop is enclosed in another loop. I suspect we should not change anything here, certainly not until there are real programs to worry about instead of toys.",
