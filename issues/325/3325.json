	"body": "\u003cpre\u003efrom rsc:\n\ni tried using tip.golang.org/doc/install/gccgo to install gccgo.\na few minor comments for anyone who wants to revise the\ninstall instructions.\n\n- i was surprised that cvs co binutils created a directory named src.\n maybe change the command to co binutils binutils, or show a mkdir+cd\n before the cvs command?\n\n- the prereq for gcc link is just gcc.gnu.org.  it would be more helpful\n to link to gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html, which took me a little\n while to get to from the main page.\n\n- building binutils failed in syslex with 'output table overflow',\n apparently because i had a lex in my path that was not good\n enough.  surprised it doesn't invoke flex directly.\n\n- i had some problems with makeinfo not being found, even\n after i apt-get installed texinfo.  i don't remember how i worked\n around them.\n\n- the gccgo configure command in the doc omits --prefix.\n might be worth adding for people who care.\n\n- not gccgo's fault, but i was annoyed that on ubuntu you get\n gmp 4 by doing apt-get install libgmp3, and you get\n mpfr 3 by doing apt-get install libmpfr4.  at least those\n were the ones i needed.  what were they thinking?\n\n- the build stopped at one point complaining that xgcc could\n not resolve -lc.  iant alerted me to:\n\n   export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\n   export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu\n   export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu\n\n which got things working again.  apparently this is an ubuntu\n problem.\n\n- the instructions say LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/gcc/MACHINE/VERSION\n but in my case it was $prefix/lib64.  there is a\n$prefix/lib/gcc/machine/version\n directory, but it's not where libgo.so.0 lives.\u003c/pre\u003e",
