Since according to the\nnet/rpc documentation the methods must have a pointer receiver I think the Register\nfunction could provide a more informative message in this case. The current error\nmessage \u0026quot;no exported methods of suitable type\u0026quot; implies there is something\nwrong with the methods themselves whereas the real problem is the way the type is being\nregistered with the Register function.\u003c/pre\u003e",
