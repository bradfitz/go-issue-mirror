I tried setting the bounds in\ninstall_exception_handler and that produced reliable crashes much earlier than before. I\nthink the problem is that Windows uses those numbers to decide when it is okay to\nallocate more stack on demand, so if they are lying and Windows faults on the OS stack,\nWindows thinks something terrible happened instead of just growing the stack. We could\nflip them back when running on the OS stack, of course, but that's a more involved\nchange to try.\n\nIf we find something like this that fixes the divmod problem, then maybe we just back\naway slowly and call it fixed, but I'm still a bit worried about the inversion of memory\naddresses along the SEH chain. I expect that is involved somehow, but perhaps I'm wrong.\nThis is one of those times when on every other system you can just go to lxr/fxr and\nlook at the source code. Oh well.\u003c/pre\u003e",
