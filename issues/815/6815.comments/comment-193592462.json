However, I think that it would now be quite easy to write an SSA pass that recognizes code [...] and substitutes a specialized op for it, and then add faster arch-specific implementations for that op. \r\n\r\nThat would address the point about compiler efficiency, but that doesn't really address the main point of the issue - which is to simplify and improve readability in code that cares about overflow and remainders.\r\n\r\n(Adding to the spec is unlikely to spare the compiler much work anyway - and this case is easy enough to optimize using any of a bunch of strategies that don't require extending the language.)",
