	"body": "In SSA we have so far avoided having ops which return multiple values.  I think such a thing is inevitable, and this is one use case for it.  Another is ops which generate both a result and a flags value, so we don't have to do things like SUBQ x, y; CMP $0, y; JNE ... .  If we had a subtract that generated a result and flags, we could avoid the comparison.\r\n\r\nMultiple-value-generating ops require some sort of tuple type and tuple-extraction psuedoops in the SSA form.  It isn't hard, but I've avoided it for now because life is simpler without those things.\r\n",
