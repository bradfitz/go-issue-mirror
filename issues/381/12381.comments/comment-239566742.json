Here is an example from one of my procs:\r\n```\r\n   ... query text ...\r\n\t\trdb.Param{Name: \"@Approve\", Type: rdb.Bool, Value: approve},\r\n\t\trdb.Param{Name: \"@Comment\", Type: rdb.Text, Value: comment},\r\n\t\trdb.Param{Name: \"@QueueType\", Type: rdb.Integer, Value: NotifyReport},\r\n\t\trdb.Param{Name: \"@Account\", Type: rdb.Integer, Value: userInfo.ID},\r\n\t\trdb.Param{Name: \"@Now\", Type: rdb.Time, Value: time.Now().UTC()},\r\n\t\trdb.Param{Name: \"@Today\", Type: rdb.TypeDate, Value: time.Now()},\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecifying the placeholder in the name may also be important as different systems accept different ones. (In the v1 of rdb, I just had the name, no placeholder and let the driver append it. I think that was a mistake.)",
