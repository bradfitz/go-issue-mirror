	"body": "@kardianos, I agree that surveying database protocols is necessary. If named parameters are not supported by a database protocol than either database/sql or driver package would have to parse supplied SQL to implement placeholder replacement correctly.\r\n\r\nFor example postgresql protocol supports positional parameters only (e.g. `$1`, `$2`, etc). [pq](http://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq) driver for go also uses this syntax. `?` placeholder syntax is not supported because fair amount of work is required to implement this functionality properly. See discussion of https://github.com/lib/pq/issues/233 for more details.\r\n\r\n@gwenn, callable statements are for stored procedures only. It is much easier to add support for named parameters in this case as most databases provide a way to get information about a stored procedure including parameter names and types.",
