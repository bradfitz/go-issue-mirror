This issue is about being able to do:\r\n```\r\ndb.Exec(`\r\nIF :ID is null begin\r\n    insert into app.Invoice (Amount) values (:Amount);\r\n    set :ID = LASTVAL();\r\nend\r\n\r\nupdate app.Invoice set\r\n    Amount = :Amount,\r\n    TimeUpdated = GETDATE()\r\nwhere\r\n    ID = :ID;`, sql.Param(\":ID\", id), sql.Param(\":Amount\", amount))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs that what you were addressing?\r\n",
