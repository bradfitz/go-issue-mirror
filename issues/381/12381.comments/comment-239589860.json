It would be very wordy at use sites.\r\n\r\n\u003e How do you feel about including type information in the NamedParam type? \r\n\r\nI don't think we should include any type information. A Go interface value already conveys the type information. If a user wants to signify a certain type, they can use a Go type with that value.\r\n",
