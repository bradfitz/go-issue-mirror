Sometimes for it maters for compatibility and sometimes for performance.\r\n\r\nIf this isn't an option, while I can still work to put in multiple result sets in `database/sql`, I will need to work on a different interface for my own uses. I'm not trying to be difficult, it is just the constraints I face; it isn't worth trying to fight the rdbms. Maybe there is a middle ground with a driver defined type like:\r\n`Query(\"select * from dbo.Locus where Name = @Locus\", sql.Param(\"Locus\", mydriver.Text(\"HLA A\")))` I'm not sure. I'm not sure yet how that would play with the rest of the pipeline.\r\n",
