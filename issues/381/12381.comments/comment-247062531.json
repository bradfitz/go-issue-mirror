It is about adding user facing API to the sql package.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar (\r\n    PersonID int64 = 42\r\n    AccountID int64 = 42\r\n)\r\n// Make query more complex, add about 10 to 20 additional params, many just bigints.\r\n// First was:\r\ndb.ExecContext(ctx, 'select Person  = :Person, Account = :Account;`, PersonID, AccountID)\r\n// Then changed to:\r\ndb.ExecContext(ctx, 'select Account  = :Account, Person = :Person;`, PersonID, AccountID)\r\n\r\n// But would still work if:\r\ndb.ExecContext(ctx,\r\n    `select Account  = :Account, Person = :Person;`,\r\n    sql.Param(\"Person\", PersonID), \r\n    sql.Param(\"Account\", AccountID)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't care how the driver works, if it uses something similar to TDS wire proto or something like postgresql that uses bind. (The TDS wire protocol will use index of the param if the name is omitted fyi.)\r\n",
