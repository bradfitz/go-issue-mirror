	"body": "Wire protocols that support named parameters should send those names to the database. If for nothing else error messages from the DB will be much easier to understand. I personally don't want to use a database that forces named parameters into indexed parameters if the wire protocol supports it.\r\n\r\nRE driver types: yes, defining DB types on the driver seems to be the way people are leaning, though I think it hurts the possibility of more generic uses. Did you see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12381#issuecomment-239873863 ? It looks like this is possible today. (I still need to investigate all the way myself.)\r\n\r\nOutput values and cursors are probably not something I personally would want to tackle with the `database/sql` API. Feel free to open a specific proposal / send a change request on thoses.",
