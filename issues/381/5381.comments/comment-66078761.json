If zero, read a byte, checking for EOF. If it's EOF immediately, write out a\n\"Content-Length: 0\".  If it's not EOF, don't send a Content-Length header.  And re-write\nout the byte before copying the rest of resp.Body.\n\nThat part isn't contentious.\n\nWhere it gets trickier is what ResponseWrite should do if ContentLength is 0 (unset) and\nthere's a body: chunked encoding or not? Function of which other headers are set? Set a\n\"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\"? But I think that's all getting outside the scope of what\nthis method should do.\n\nLike I said, the http.Server code does all this correctly already, so you must be\nwriting your own server, which means you are probably doing lots of this sort of stuff\nnow, right?  If not, what's the actual problem?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **suggested**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
