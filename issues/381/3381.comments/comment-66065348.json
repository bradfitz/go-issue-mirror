Personally I would\nhave been very happy with a SIGILL. The EABI result was so confusing as as far as I know\nnothing uses the old ABI, so that simply wasnt the problem. I guess if you were very\nnice you could set up a SIGILL handler at the beginning of any non GOARM=5 executable\nand then run a bunch of instructions that are not supported on old architectures, and\nreport a helpful error, then carry on to the existing test...\u003c/pre\u003e",
