The convention is that comments precede the function definition, so I would not\ncall the current behavior \"incorrect\".\n\nSince in this use case it is not really a godoc comment, I'd suggest considering a\ndifferent convention for go present that does not interfere with the pre-existing godoc\none. (E.g. \"// START\" and \"// STOP\" surrounded by blank lines.) Alternatively, if godoc\nis never to be used with go present source files, having different gofmt modes might be\nan option as well (distinguished via a command line option or some marker in the source).\n\nIf the gofmt behavior is to be changed universally, it should be designed such that both\nof these are handled correctly, which does not seem straightforward to me:\n\n// START\nfunc f() {\n}\n// END\n// START\nfunc g() {\n}\n// END\n...\n\n// Function f blahblahblah...\n// blahblahblah...\nfunc f() {\n}\n// Function g blahblahblah...\n// blahblahblah...\nfunc g() {\n}\n...\n\nJust my two cents.\u003c/pre\u003e",
