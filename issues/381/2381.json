	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIt is fairly trivial to compile a given Go version and run the doc server locally to\nsearch for an older API.\n\nBut it would be nice if golang.org provided access to docs per release. One simple\nsolution to this is to add an option to godoc to generate static docs on disk -- just a\ntree of static files (search would be disabled of course). Then docs for old versions\ncould be made available somewhere in golang.org.\n\nOne additional benefit is that projects that want to ship docs could generate the static\nfiles and provide the html files for download, or create pdfs, chms etc based on them.\n\nPS: I tried searching for a similar issue; sorry if this is a duplicate.\u003c/pre\u003e",
