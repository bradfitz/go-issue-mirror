One could add more methods, but the question arises where to stop: When\nis a method not part of the AST anymore, but a function operating on the AST. The\ndecision - made long ago - was to keep the AST free of such methods.\n\nSome of the functionality crept it over time, yet the AST is still just a data\nstructure. Once such functionality becomes methods, one might ask why is printing, type\nchecking, etc. not implemented as methods. It's better to not add all this to the AST.\n\nIt would be nice if the FileSet would be recorded in the Package and File, but it\ndoesn't solve all use cases (operations om portions of the AST). Also, it doesn't work\nif an AST contains pieces from different files (which is theoretically possible). I'd be\nok with that change as it is backward-compatible (except for the multiple files issue).\nHowever, the go/printer would still need the separate FileSet for printing of partial\nASTs (decls).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
