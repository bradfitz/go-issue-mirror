I don't like making the\nconnectMethodKey larger.\n\nIt seems that you really just want a way to control the Transport.Dial phase to connect\nto a specific IP when making https requests. Somebody else wanted that too, but I can't\nfind the bug or email right now. (Something about Transport Dial or DialTLS ...)\n\nIn Go 1.3, the URL and Host fields of Request are documented well:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request\u003c/a\u003e\n\n        // For client requests, the URL's Host specifies the server to\n        // connect to, while the Request's Host field optionally\n        // specifies the Host header value to send in the HTTP\n        // request.\n        URL *url.URL\n\n        // For client requests Host optionally overrides the Host\n        // header to send. If empty, the Request.Write method uses\n        // the value of URL.Host.\n        Host string\n\nI don't want to make those more complicated and introduce a new concept of \"which\nhostname is used for TLS checks\".\n\nFeel free to argue otherwise if you can tell me why this is useful or where there's\nprecedent that we're doing it wrong.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
