I'm wondering because they specifically have to be sequentially consistent to match the x86 atomics, and it's really easy to be less than sequentially consistent on ARM. Unfortunately, I don't know the semantics of the ARM instructions well enough to be sure, but I don't see any DMBs in the arm64 code, and my understanding is that STLR is only store-release, not sequentially consistent.",
