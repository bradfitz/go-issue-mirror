Are you sure that's 64-bit ARMv8?\r\n\r\nI've reread the ARM memory model several times now and I think the way we implement atomics on arm64 means there's a (sequentially consistent) total order over atomic operations, *but* allows roach-motel reordering between atomics operations and non-atomic operations. This is certainly weaker than what we implement on x86 and I believe on 32-bit arm. It's possibly also weaker than our unwritten memory model or the assumptions of the runtime. @dvyukov?\r\n\r\nHowever, I've also been reading over the lock/unlock implementation and I don't see how this could lead to this particular panic.",
