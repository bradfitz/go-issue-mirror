I have run the sync, sync/atomic, and runtime tests millions of times (quite literally, I've ran them in a loop for over a month) on the 48 core (or was it 2*48?) Cavium Thunderx platform (which @vijaykilari thinks we don't have access to).\r\n\r\nHowever, even with all of that working, maybe I misunderstand something about the Go memory model and Go needs something stronger than C here. We can try strengthening the atomics here, and see if this problem persists.\r\n",
