The elided\n\u003e type should be the exact type inferred from the context in which the\n\u003e literal appears, not an equivalent unnamed struct type.\n\u003e\nI suppose the answer depends on whether the literals are untyped (in the\nsame sense as untyped constants) or merely have their type elided (but\nstill effectively present). I tend towards the former as being the simpler\nchange, but I get the impression that this is a minority viewpoint. :)\n",
