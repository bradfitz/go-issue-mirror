	"body": "One note on the \"large parameter list as struct\" use case. Let's say this proposal is accepted and people choose to use the idiom described above with anonymous struct types as arguments.\r\n\r\nThis will improve the most common way of calling the function by removing the redundant type name. But it will make it much more difficult to construct the argument to the function in a way that is not fully literal (eg if a field needs to be set conditionally) because it will be very difficult to declare an object of the argument type. While this proposal would not require libraries to define their functions using anonymous struct types as arguments, I would consider it a problem if this became popular, and it is the first example in the proposal.",
