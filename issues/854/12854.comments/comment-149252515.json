Which of the following would be in Go style?\r\n\r\nFor consistency, it seems likely that the following would be favored:\r\n\r\n    var m = map[int]string{1: \"foo\", 2: \"bar\"}\r\n\r\nIt's what you have to do if you want to use the short declaration form, and leverages right-to-left inference. Since composite types can't be constant in Go, the current const elision rules have no impact on this particular question of style.",
