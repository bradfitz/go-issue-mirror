That\nis, when compiling the syscall package, you want to compile some files with -race and\nsome without?  Further, do you really care about the file level?  Would it suffice to\ncompile some functions with -race and some without?\n\nNote that we already have a precedent for comments that are specific to functions, such\nas //go:noescape.  It seems that it would not be out of the question to have a\n//go:norace comment.\u003c/pre\u003e",
