	"body": "We plan to make GOEXPERIMENT=framepointer the default for the Go 1.7 beta 1,\nas a trial balloon toward leaving it on for the Go 1.7 release.\nThere is a small performance hit to having frame pointers enabled\n(typically 1-3%), but this release brings with it significantly more\nthan that due to SSA, so we have the budget available to do this without\nslowing down user programs compared to the previous release.\n\nHaving frame pointers on by default means that Linux perf, Intel VTune,\nand other profilers can grab Go stack traces much more efficiently,\nmaking the profiles significantly more reflective of reality.\nThis is a good default to have. The performance work enabled by this\nprobably also significantly outweighs the slowdown.\n\n/cc @aclements @randall77",
