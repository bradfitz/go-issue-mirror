Anything we can do to initialize globals without\ninits will help (see https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/17398/ for an\nexample).  It doesn't look like this is an easy transformation here,\nbecause newDead() could do anything.\nIf instead it was:\n\n    var x = new(dead)\n\nmaybe we could rewrite that in the compiler to\n\n    var _x dead\n    var x = \u0026_x\n\nthe latter wouldn't need any init code, just relocations, so if x was\notherwise unused both x and _x would be stripped out at link time.\n\nOn Wed, Mar 16, 2016 at 1:49 PM, Brad Fitzpatrick \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e This could help with shrinking init-time map literal construction in e.g.\n\u003e the unicode package.\n\u003e\n\u003e If the unicode.init funcs generating the unicode's various maps were\n\u003e flagged as side-effect-free, then the whole init funcs can be deadcode\n\u003e eliminated if nobody referred to those maps.\n\u003e\n\u003e /cc @crawshaw \u003chttps://github.com/crawshaw\u003e @josharian\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/josharian\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/14840#issuecomment-197542441\u003e\n\u003e\n",
