You'd want to decide the side-effect-freeness of the RHS of global initializers before the init function is built.\r\nProbably a very simple analysis would capture most of the cases we care about.\r\n\r\nAnd then you'd have to have an init function per global, have it associated with the global, and only link it in if the global was otherwise reachable.",
