	"body": "Context: /moretypes/12\r\n\r\nThere was insufficient information on the page for \"range\" to explain the associated code. Having not read the documentation for range I was not aware that i and v are both values returned by the range function - representing the index and value of each element of pow - and it took me a while to come to that realisation. I did not immediately realise that i and v were separated by a  comma as opposed to the semicolon I expected to see. This could be made clearer with a more verbose description.",
