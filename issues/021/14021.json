	"body": "On modern Linux /tmp is often mounted as in-memory file system not suitable for large temporary files. Such files or files that should survive a reboot should be stored in /var/tmp. Yet Go does not provide a convenient method to access the latter and most code just use os.TempDir() for temporary files. This leads to bugs like when Docker used /tmp for big temporary image files leading to not-enough-space errors.\r\n\r\nSo it would be nice to have something like os.PersistentTempDir() that returns /var/tmp on Linux.",
