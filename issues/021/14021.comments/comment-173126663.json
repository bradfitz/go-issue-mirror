And considering the size of my /var partition, you would be more happy with my memory-backed /tmp than my disk-backed /var/tmp.\r\n\r\n\u003e Still, what about changing the default for TempDir to return /var/tmp?\r\n\r\nI would consider this a breaking change. /tmp and /var/tmp are entirely different things. And people certainly wouldn't want large files sticking around because a program failed to clean up behind itself (system crash or similar).\r\n\r\nMaybe Docker shouldn't abuse either /tmp nor /var/tmp and look into defining its own path under /var/cache or similar.",
