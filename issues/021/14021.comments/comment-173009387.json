The reason why os.TempDir exists is the fragmentation among operating systems where temp files must be written and TempDir is doing fair job and is useful for programs that will be distributed among multiple platforms.\r\n\r\nWhat is the equivalent of persistent temp directory on other platforms? If you are only targeting Linux, why don't you just hardcode /var/tmp?\r\n\r\nIn any case, TEMPDIR is honored by io.TempDir and ioutil.Tmp* utilities can create directories and files against its value.",
