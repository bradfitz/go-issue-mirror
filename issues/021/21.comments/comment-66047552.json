The problem encounter here is that translated error \nmessages do not match the registered error messages.\n\nA possible work around would be to set LC_ALL=C before calling \"cgo\".  This could be \ndone in a small shell script.\n\n#!/bin/sh\nLC_ALL=C /path/to/.cgo \"@\"\n\nI am currently looking into fixing this inside src/pkg/cmd/*.go files.  I'll add \nattach a diff on this issue if I succeed to make it work without the script shell \nhack.\u003c/pre\u003e",
