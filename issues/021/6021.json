	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nThe virt_asm.c helpers tend to show up in the hot path of the runtime, the garbage\ncollector, the netpoll code, etc. \n\n5c currently defers to runtime functions to handle any operations involving 64 bit\nquantities. 5g can handle them internally, but the code in cgen64.c is not easily\nconverted to run on 5c.\n\nWhile not a trivial job, is it possible to include a scaffold for handling 64bit\noperations inside 5c, the operations could be added as needed once the scaffold is in\nplace.\u003c/pre\u003e",
