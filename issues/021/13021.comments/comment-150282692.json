	"body": "A related proposal is to remove the Deadline method from the Context interface and so remove its dependence on the \"time\" package.  This would permit the Context interface to be used in packages that cannot depend on \"time\".  Context's deadline support would be implemented using a Context value.  Callers would access the deadline with a function in a separate package deadline as `deadline.FromContext(context.Context) (time.Time, bool)`.  This is a more invasive change than the original proposal; it is only justified if we can identify packages that should use Context but cannot depend on \"time\".",
