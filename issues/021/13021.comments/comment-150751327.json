	"body": "Please write a proposal doc. Be sure to mention\n\n- the migration problem\n- tradeoffs for what package Context should go into\n- a list of what changes would be made in the standard library to use Context\n\nFWIW I don't see any compelling reason to try to eliminate references to package time from the context API. Even if Context were to go into io, it seems okay to me at first glance to make io depend on time.\n\nThanks.",
