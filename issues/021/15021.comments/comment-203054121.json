	"body": "Hi Russ,\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that the runtime network poller functionality is exposed directly using the `net.pollDesc` type, which is then wrapped by `net.netFD` and `net.conn`.  From what I can tell, it appears I'd have to duplicate or possibly move some code from package `net` to package `syscall` in order to enable accessing the runtime network poller there.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'm looking at `net/fd_unix.go`, and `net/fd_poll_runtime.go`.  Is there an easier answer to this problem that I am not yet aware of?\r\n\r\nThanks for the quick reply, and I look forward to hearing back.",
