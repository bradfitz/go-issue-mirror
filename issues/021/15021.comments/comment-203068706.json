	"body": "I am in favor of moving it to package `syscall` instead, but because much of the low-level functionality to access the runtime network poller already exists in package `net`, I am not sure how to best access the network poller from package `syscall` without duplicating code or moving it to `syscall` entirely.\r\n\r\nCan you suggest a viable approach to solving this problem?  Perhaps the low level runtime network poller code in `net` could be moved to an internal package that both `net` and `syscall` use to access it?\r\n\r\nIn summary, yes, I am in favor of creating `syscall.RegisterSocket` instead, but I am simply not sure how to access the runtime network poller from package `syscall` instead of package `net`, where it resides now, without code duplication.\r\n\r\nEDIT: in addition, since `net` imports `syscall`, but I would need the `net.Addr` type in `syscall`, this would create a circular dependency.  Any thoughts on how to resolve this issue as well?",
