It could in these\ncases just do a pointer comparison, I think.\nThis isn't a major problem, but it does seem to mean that simple type checks\ntake longer than method calls, meaning that code that cares about performance\nends up mirroring its types in some const ints. An example of this is the regexp package;\nit is possible to completely remove \u0026quot;kind()\u0026quot; and just use type switches and\ntype assertions,\nbut it results in a performance hit.\n\nI know there are other more pressing issues, but I thought I'd enter this in the record\nso it doesn't get forgotten.\n\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?
