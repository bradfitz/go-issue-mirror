The values of b and c are used to determine the execution path of the\nprogram; different values of b and c result in different execution paths.\n\nExample 2 simplifies example 1 by replacing c by b and return with the null statement.\nThe value of the variable a is never used; whether the value is 0 or 1 is irrelevant.\nThe value of b is used to determine the execution path of the program; although\ndifferent values of b don't result in different execution paths. Also, the null\nstatement conditional execution path is irrelevant. There are limits on what the\ncompiler reports and the degree of optimization.\u003c/pre\u003e",
