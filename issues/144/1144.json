Compile this code:\n\npackage main\n\nimport \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\n\nfunc main() {\n        a := make([]int, 5)\n\n        for b, c := range a {\n                c = b\n        }\n\n        fmt.Println(a)\n}\n\n2.\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n6g bug.go\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n6g bug.go\nbug.go:8: c declared and not used\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nDebian Lenny (Linux)\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\ne3e545d51aef tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nChanging it to:\n\npackage main\n\nimport \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\n\nfunc main() {\n        a := make([]int, 5)\n\n        for b, c := range a {\n                if c == c {\n                        // Nothing\n                }\n                c = b\n        }\n\n        fmt.Println(a)\n}\n\nFixes it for some reason. Maybe I don't understand the intended semantics? But it seems\nthat c is clearly used.\n\nNote: It seems I didn't understand that \u0026quot;c\u0026quot; _isn't_ a reference to the element\nin the array. This might be why an error message is appropriate -- but \u0026quot;c is not\nused\u0026quot; does not seem correct, as it is clearly used.\u003c/pre\u003e",
