There is no other write w' to v that happens after w but before r.\n\n   A read r of a variable v is also allowed to observe a write w to v if w happens concurrently with r.\n\n   If a w does not fit into either of these two cases,  a read r of\n   variable v is not allowed to observe the write w to v.\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\nA read r of a variable v is allowed to observe a write w to v if both of the following\nhold:\n\n    w happens before r.\n    There is no other write w' to v that happens after w but before r.\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\nN/A\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nN/A\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nN/A\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThe existing statement concerning \u0026quot;is allowed to observe\u0026quot; meant to define what\nare the possible set of w that may provide the value seen by the r. \n\nBroadly there are three types of w. (1) those w that happens-before r (2) those w that w\nhappens-after s (3) those w that happens concurrently with r. \n\nThe existing statement only says what subset of w from (1) is allowed to by observed by\nr. \n\nMy revision, will be more explicit on the intended definition of \u0026quot;is allowed to\nobserve\u0026quot;.\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
