Does it do the full dance that you gave as the first example? If yes, there's still the possibility that u.HostPort() returns something with an empty port, since, as you said, there might not be any scheme, isn't there? If yes, I don't think it's worth providing. if there's still some checking to do on top of it, then I don't think the method is bringing much to the table.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think a helper like camlistore.org/pkg/netutil.HasPort might be nice. I suppose, with the new functions, it would become something like:\r\n\r\n    return u.Port() != \"\"\r\n\r\nwhich is actually simple enough as it is, so maybe no need for HasPort.",
