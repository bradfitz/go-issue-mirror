If yes, there's still the possibility that u.HostPort() returns something with an empty port, since, as you said, there might not be any scheme, isn't there? If yes, I don't think it's worth providing. if there's still some checking to do on top of it, then I don't think the method is bringing much to the table.\r\n\r\nYeah, it was a hypothetical go-all-the-way example. I agree it's too much, since you'd need to do your own checking anyway.\r\n",
