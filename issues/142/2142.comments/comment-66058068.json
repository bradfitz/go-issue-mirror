The current pointers are in the range 0xf8\u0026lt;\u0026lt;32 up to\n(but not including) 0xfc\u0026lt;\u0026lt;32, and f8, f9, fa, fb never appear in UTF-8 sequences.\nWe can expand the current space to ff, so 32 GB, before hitting valid UTF-8.\n\nAn alternative would be to use 0x0080\u0026lt;\u0026lt;32 up to (but not including)\n0x00C0\u0026lt;\u0026lt;32, because 80-bf never appear in UTF-8 following an ASCII byte like 00.\nThat would be 256 GB worth of address space.\u003c/pre\u003e",
