There is no indication, such as a compile-time warning, about the behavior, and it's quite confusing. It necessitates an understanding of a very particular and frankly unusual piece of trivia about the Go compiler, and I think it's not in the language's interest to leave something so vague.\r\nI'm not sure I understand why, in a language whose formatting tools encourage some superfluous whitespace between things like struct field names and their types, a little extra checking can't be done to avoid subtle cases like this.\r\nCan this not be a discussion that isn't just shut down because of what your sacred spec says?",
