Most people don't know about EKUs and this might save them from a nasty security bug where they didn't think about what other certificates a given CA might be issuing.\r\n\r\nFor cases where one wants to override this, there's already an option for bypassing automatic verification and then you can do whatever you want.\r\n\r\nI'm not seeing a convincing case for changing things here.",
