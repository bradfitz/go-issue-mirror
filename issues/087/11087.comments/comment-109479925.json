	"body": "Thanks for your comment...\r\n\r\n@agl by this logic you should not allow server certificates that don't specify ExtKeyUsageServerAuth.  \r\nMost people don't know about EKUs and they might use a cert for a server that doesn't have KeyUsageServerAuth specified...  So requiring a server cert to be marked for server use is a reasonable default... Do you agree?\r\n\r\nThis isn't about people knowing or not knowing about EKUs.  If an EKU isn't there you aren't required to check for this...  But you are.  This is incompatible with the standard and is breaking existing client certs.  You're not really saving people from security bugs, it's perfectly fine/secure to use a cert without any specified key usages as a client auth certificate.\r\n\r\nI agree that if EKU is in the cert you should enforce it.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate it if you could point me to how I could bypass automatic verification in the context of a TLS HTTP server application.  I haven't been able to find a clean way to do that.  I'm using both client and sever authentication.",
