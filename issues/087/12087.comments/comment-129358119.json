	"body": "\u003e I do not quite understand. Is the recommended solution to delete GOROOT/pkg/linux_arm whenever I want to re-compile for a different GOARM? Or is there a way so that those (it seems) GOARM dependent binary files are not kept?\r\n\r\nThere should be no files there, and if Go is trying to write them there, that is a bug. \r\n\r\nWhen cross compiling you should use `go build` not `go install` to avoid Go complaining it cannot write to `$GOROOT/pkg/...`. If it does write there, because it has permission, then you should delete those files as it is hard to know what `GOARM` value they contain.\r\n\r\n\u003e If I am not allowed to write to GOROOT/pkg I get this error: go install runtime: mkdir /usr/local/go/pkg/linux_arm/: permission denied that is why I used to install go to $HOME/go.\r\n\r\nYou want to avoid Go caching files to `$GOROOT/pkg` because you cannot tell which variant they are.\r\n\r\nFWIW, if you do not provide `GOARM` then things will mostly work as `GOARM` defaults to 6 which is the most widely appropriate value.",
