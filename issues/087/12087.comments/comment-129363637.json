	"body": "Okay, now I understand. Sorry for the confusion. I used `go get` in another script. That is the reason why `pkg/linux_arm` was written in the first place and so those files would also be used even if I ran `go build` in my tests.\r\n\r\nI suppose the biggest problem for me was that in 1.4.2 I could use `go get` without any GOARM stickyness and a writeable GOROOT which I can no longer in 1.5. The reason I made GOROOT writeable was actually the necessary cross compilation preparations I needed before 1.5.\r\n\r\nI now changed my GOROOT to no longer be writeable by normal users and will always use `go build` for cross compilation. \r\n\r\nSo I guess it was actually not a bug but my messed up installation. Thank you for figuring this out!",
