	"body": "I am getting the error `Illegal instruction` when running a simple program (as simple as a \"hello world\" with no dependencies, even when only using print(\"hello world\")) on linux/arm (raspberry pi B model) which I cross compiled on linux/amd64 with 1.5.rc1 no matter what value I set GOARM to (tested it with 5, 6 and 7).\r\n\r\nRunning the program with gdb gives me this error:\r\n\r\n    Program received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.\r\n    runtime.check () at \u003cGOROOT\u003e/src/runtime/runtime1.go:146\r\n\r\nso I guess it is related to the float32 variables here: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/runtime1.go#L146\r\n\r\nThe very same program cross compiles just fine with 1.4.2 (using GOARM 5 and 6) and just gives me the usual error when trying `GOARM=7` \r\n\r\n    runtime: this CPU has no VFPv3 floating point hardware, so it cannot run\r\n    this GOARM=7 binary. Recompile using GOARM=6.",
