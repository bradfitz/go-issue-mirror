It seems bad to promote a time format which is more restrictive than `YYYY` without spelling out the risks.\r\n\r\nAnd what about creating a microseconds interface?  I haven't tested the following code yet, but you can observe that the conversion functions are nontrivial in both directions:\r\n\r\n`return time.Unix(usec / 1000000, (usec % 1000000) * 1000)`\r\n\r\n`return t.Unix() * 1000000 + int64(t.Nanosecond() / 1000)`",
