Moreoever, running\njust the failed test (as opposed to the collection of tests that include that test) is\nsomething that is not entirely obvious and also varying.\n\nWhile there are plenty of # lines, they are not entirely hepful.  Consider the following\nfailure\n\n# ../test/bench/go1\nok  \t_/usr/local/google/home/cshapiro/go/test/bench/go1\t2.360s\n\n# ../test\nSIGSEGV: segmentation violation\nPC=0x41c671\n\nWhat do I do?  The 28 stack traces that follow do not contain any obvious clues about\nwhat was running when the failure occured.  Any good programmer can, given the time,\neventually reverse engineering what the right test invocation is but that time is better\nspent diagnosing the failure.\n\nWhat I want to see after a failure like that is a command line that I can paste into the\nshell so I can re-run just the test that caused the failure.\u003c/pre\u003e",
