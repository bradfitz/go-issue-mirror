The test suite used by the Dart team uses a test harness\nwritten in Dart that runs a half-dozen different test suites with thousands of tests. \nEach failure is reported with a command line that can be pasted back into the shell to\nrepeat the failure.  The turn around time for identifying and fixing a failing test is\nvery low.\u003c/pre\u003e",
