The sad fact of\nself-hosted systems like ours is that if you break the runtime or the compiler there's\nvery little stable left to stand on. Assuming it is the test runner that has failed, you\nwould not have gotten a useful command line even if we were trying to print them.\n\nOne possibility is that if this is an ongoing problem you could add 'set -x' to the top\nof your src/run.bash.\u003c/pre\u003e",
