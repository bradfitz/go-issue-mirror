Thanks.\n\nAs far as I know, we usually see the crash when a map is being manipulated. We have also\nseen one or two SIGSEGVs in other places.\n\nOne dirty little secret: the program uses cgo. Even worse, it's a third party C library\nwe don't have source for. That being said, we haven't had any issues with it before, but\nyou never know. We'll see if we can eliminate the parts of the crashing test that call\ncgo. We'll also try to run the C code on its own with the same inputs, if we can manage\nto build a pure C program.\n\nThis is one case where even GCC's -fsanitize=address wouldn't have helped, since we\ndon't have the C source. Being able to Valgrind the Go binary might have been very\nuseful.\n\ncgo aside, the almost immediate crash when running under gdb looks like another issue.\nBy the time that happens, I don't think any C code has been invoked.\u003c/pre\u003e",
