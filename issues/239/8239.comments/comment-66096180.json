It would be great to extend that (fork\nit?) to also download and install the correct versions of WiX.\n\nIf that can be done, I am totally in favour of updating to a newer version of WiX.\n\nI would also like investigate moving makerelease to a separate repository that can be\nmanaged independent to the Go release cycle. That would resolve any issues you have with\nthe wix scripts coming from one version of Go and makerelease coming from another. I'll\ncreate a separate issue for that.\u003c/pre\u003e",
