	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\nIt was 1.6 (on a work computer I don't have access to anymore).\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nIt was Mac OS 10.11 (on a work computer I don't have access to anymore).\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\n\r\nThere's a race condition in Server.ServeCodec, where the connection is closed without waiting for all calls to finish:\r\n\r\n    477\t\t\tgo service.call(server, sending, mtype, req, argv, replyv, codec)\r\n    478\t\t}\r\n    479\t\tcodec.Close()\r\n\r\nIn this code, the go statement is executed in a loop, and then the codec is closed immediately after the loop ends, which in the case of the jsonrpc codec closes the connection used by the calls before they can finish, resulting in errors.",
