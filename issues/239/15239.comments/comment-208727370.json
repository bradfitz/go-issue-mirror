You want to build your Go code as DLL and use it with one of your programs.\r\n\r\nBut Go cannot create DLLs yet (see issue #11058 for details). And the plan proposed on issue #11058 is still not clear. And the plan is based on using mingw - mingw runtime might not work with your program. And I hope you've heard about downsides of using cgo - http://dave.cheney.net/2016/01/18/cgo-is-not-go - I can add more.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you reconsider using standalone Go built executable. You can run it as a Windows service, if that helps any.\r\n\r\nAlex",
