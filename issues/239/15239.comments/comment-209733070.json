The only limitation (to my knowledge) is getting a compatible set of object code in that go c-archive. Once you have that, it's fairly trivial to link it into a dll.\r\n\r\nIf you know what to do, why don't you try and build what you want.\r\n\r\nIf you did try to build something, and are having problems, then you need to provide more details about what you did and what worked or not worked.\r\n\r\n\u003e If only there was a pure go sql impl.\r\n\r\nIn my pre Go life I used sqlite3.dll to access sqlite functionality. I am certain it can be done with pure Go today. This is obviously \"windows only\" solution. And you would have to copy sqlite3.dll together with your Go executable everywhere.\r\n\r\nAlex",
