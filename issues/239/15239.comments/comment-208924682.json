The only limitation (to my knowledge) is getting a compatible set of object code in that go c-archive.  Once you have that, it's fairly trivial to link it into a dll.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd like to see our architecture be more akin to chrome where there is a main process which essentially becomes an launch controller for slave processes (where this standalone go exe would live), but it has been a nonstarter for given architectural constraints.  Many in the org want to use Go as a common, first-class language here.  I'm looking to take that momentum into some new products/tech spaces.\r\n\r\nTo do that I just need a solution for this last issue :-/  \r\n\r\nI'd be good not using cgo at all, but the sqlite3 driver in go is amalgamated c.  If only there was a pure go sql impl.",
