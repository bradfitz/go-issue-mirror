	"body": "As `crypto/hmac.Equal` is relying on `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`, which already checks the length of the two byte slices, we do not need such a length check in `crypto/hmac.Equal`.\r\n\r\n`crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/subtle/constant_time.go#L12\r\n`crypto/hmac.Equal`: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/hmac/hmac.go#L97\r\n\r\nI think the length check was used in `crypto/hmac.Equal` as it was previously not included in `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`.",
