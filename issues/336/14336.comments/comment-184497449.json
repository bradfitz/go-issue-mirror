If you're in a terminal inside screen or tmux and not using a terminal program that's integrated with screen or tmux, then your scrollbars and in-terminal search are basically useless. But if you're in your pager, you can navigate and search comfortably. git only invokes the pager when the height of the output is greater than the height of the screen, which seems like a reasonable trade-off.\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm not the advocate for this feature, but it would be kinda nice. I almost never invoke go help or godoc or go doc without piping it into my pager.",
