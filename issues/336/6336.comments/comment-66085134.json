I don't know which would be more inexplicable for the\nunsuspecting user: different DNS lookups by Go programs, or strange behaviour when doing\nhighly concurrent name lookups.\n\nI don't think we should take any immediate steps now.  We should give the glibc\nmaintainers several days to analyze the bug report.  The nature of the bug in glibc may\nsuggest workarounds we can take in Go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
