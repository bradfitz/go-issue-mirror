I'll figure out how to submit to Gerrit / add the \"Under construction\" label later when I'm being less lazy (or just git mail it and let someone else deal with Gerrit).\r\n\r\nFor now, I've moved my repo to https://bitbucket.org/SamWhited/golang-x-text (which is now a full mirror of the text package) and will try to remember to keep it updated in case anyone wants to see the progress.",
