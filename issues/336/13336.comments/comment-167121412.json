More on that below.\r\n\r\n\u003e The prepare step I see defined just returns a boolean yes or no.\r\n\r\nThe PRECIS spec itself makes it sound like a simple yes or no, but some of the individual profile's (eg. see the [UsernameCaseMapped](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7613#section-3.2) profile) require additional transformations.\r\n\r\nIf it were just \"stripping out spaces\" and the like I'd agree with you; but it's supposed to be about ensuring that the strings will actually work once you send them to the server. The point of prepare is client/server compatibility, and if every client has to do it themselves I suspect that will suffer. Other profiles may do more than just width mapping in the future.\r\n\r\n\u003e For comparison it is a different story. For the API here I'm more inclined to support higher-level profile options like IgnoreCaseForCompare, or just IgnoreCase. â€¦ If we know it is a stateless Transformer, which all default mappings are, we can optimize a lot. This needs to be a consideration as well.\r\n\r\nFair point, I'd love to ensure that only stateless transformers can be used. I'm somewhat worried about future compatiblity, but since it's an options based API, I suppose we can always add more/different options if we need to later, so that sounds good to me.\r\n\r\n\u003e Regarding the Contains method: I like it better to return a runes.Set than implement the contains method\r\n\r\nWilco; what does this actually get us? It seems simpler the other way, but I'm happy to switch back.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** Done.",
