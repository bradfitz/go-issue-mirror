So, I see a few options for the API that might be okay:\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Define a pre-prepare option as a function\r\n\r\n```go\r\nPrePrepare(f func(s string) (string, error)) Option\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Define a pre-prepare option as a list of transformers\r\n\r\n(this is what I was doing before)\r\n\r\n```go\r\nPrePrepare(t ...transform.Transformer) Option\r\n```",
