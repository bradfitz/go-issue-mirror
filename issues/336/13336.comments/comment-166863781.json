	"body": "Can you give an example when width is required before prepare, when it cannot be used, and for both cases why?  Semantically this seems very funky. More reason to not support prepare, I would say. The two reasons for prepare in the RFC doc are 1) availability of the functionality, which we have (and tables will be pulled in either way with the current API design, so no savings there either), and 2) performance, where I doubt it will be an issue (if we have a full validator it can be made a lot faster than simply doing the transform). I just don't see why we need to have these two concepts around and complicating things for both the implementer and the user for just a marginal gain.  I think it is a great win to just see a Profile as a single Transformation with a single meaning. The perpare step can always be added later if it turns out people really need it. ",
