	"body": "Update: I've switched the implementation around to using the `x/text/internal/gen` and `x/text/internal/triegen` packages in the [text-package branch](https://bitbucket.org/SamWhited/go-precis/src/text-package). Further work will continue here.\r\n\r\nAlso, that API makes good sense to me and I've started implementing it. I'm not sure if it makes more sense to use the methods that @mpvl mentioned, which are consistent with a lot of names in other `x/text` packages, or if it makes more sense to name them as they're named in the RFC. Eg. I'm not sure which of these makes the most sense:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (p *Profile) Enforce(s string) (string, error) {}\r\nfunc (p *Profile) String(s string) (string, error) {}\r\n\r\nfunc (p *Profile) PrepareString(s string) bool {}\r\nfunc (p *Profile) ValidString(s string) bool {} // This was error above, but chances are we just want to check it. Maybe a separate API to get a reason? I'll think about it.\r\n```",
