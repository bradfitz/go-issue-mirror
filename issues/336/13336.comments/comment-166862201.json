We can add it later as needed.\r\n\r\nAt the core the Enforce should be a transformer, I agree. However, we should have pre-defined wrappers  for String, Bytes, etc. (see API I defined earlier).  There are multiple reasons why these are important. Firstly, ease of use (users tend to use the transforms incorrectly when they are not there, see the recent encoding changes). Secondly, in this case, it allows for some significant optimizations down the road.\r\n\r\n",
