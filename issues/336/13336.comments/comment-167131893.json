We can always add a different way to do preparation if we need it later.\r\n\r\nI was mostly resistant because of the fact that enforcement was so much slower than preparation in my benchmarks (by ~90% for the nickname profile, IIRC), but I just did a more \"real world\" test by enforcing a very large set of XMPP JID's and realized that \"slower\" doesn't mean much when you're talking less than 5000 ns per operation (as opposed to stringprep, which locks my client up for several seconds each time I log in and fetch my roster).",
