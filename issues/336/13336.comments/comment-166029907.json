	"body": "Thanks for the review!\r\n\r\nI've fixed a number of things from the review (still haven't redesigned the API, so most of the things that weren't fixed were things that would be removed anyways) and want to update; what's the process for updating on Gerrit? The relavant section [in the docs](https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html#tmp_14) doesn't appear to have normal Git workflow instructions. If I push up a new detatched patch-set will it create a new review, or is it smart enough to update my old one?\r\n\r\nThis process is insane; I'd forgotten why I stopped using Gerrit years ago, they seem to have no clue how Git is supposed to work.\r\n\r\n*EDIT*: Nevermind, figured out that that's what the change ID is for and updated the old commit. This is still insane, why in the world would Gerrit do this instead of just using a git ref and letting you update that (a branch or a tag)?\r\n\r\nI've now added an explicit class struct that implements the runes.Set interface. This gives us a Contains(rune) method for the classes. Will work on the profile API next. I have submitted an errata to the RFC for the language that got me confused and made me think the current API would work in the first place.",
