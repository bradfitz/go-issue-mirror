	"body": "Just pushed changes to have just a transform interface, but it's currently doing something weird and calling Transform twice if I add the additional mapping step. I have no idea where the Chain() call is even getting a pointer to the original profile; I've been stepping through it with GDB and still don't see where it's actually happening. Anyways, went ahead and pushed it up, but know that it's currently broken because of this. The implementation is insanely jank right now anyways, but I don't see a better way to do it that's not more complicated than I want to deal with at the moment. Will advise.\r\n\r\n*EDIT*: Ah, nevermind, I see; it's the call to `transform.String`. Adding an EOF check fixed it. The code is still pretty terrible though.",
