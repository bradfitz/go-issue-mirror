	"body": "For now, I've also implemented the Enforce method as far as it can go, and fixed the Allowed method to show why it's different from the class level Contains method. I'm thinking that maybe allowed and disallowed should be removed in favor of just having profile's be Set's too. Next thing on my radar is more tests; a few other implementors and I are currently discussing writing a standard set of test vectors and submitting them as an RFC as well; if anyone is interested, see the PRECIS WG mailing list.\r\n\r\nThis is probably ready for another round of review.\r\n\r\n*EDIT:* Yah, not sure why I did `Allowed` and `Disallowed` for profile's in the first place. Replaced them with a `Contains` method.\r\n\r\n*EDIT 2*: I'm also starting to wonder why we have an `Enforce` method. Might just make profile implement Transformer and use that for enforcement? I feel like there was a reason I didn't do that originally though which I'm not thinking of.",
