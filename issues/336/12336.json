	"title": "proposal: Provide mechanism for custom x509 verification in crypto/tls",
	"body": "Most typical SSL/TLS interactions warrant a standard x509 validation process involving verifying a chain of x509s against a pre-established set of root CAs.  However, there are a subset of applications where this is not the desired functionality.  APIs such as OpenSSL recognize this and provide a way to override the default behavior (e.g. SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback).  crypto/tls seems to lack such a feature, instead opting to invoke x509.Verify() directly.  It would be helpful to provide conceptual equivalence, perhaps by allowing a Verify function to be set on the Config. \r\n",
