If b were an untyped constant, it would work (see e.g.,\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/Td7n1UGr67\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/Td7n1UGr67\u003c/a\u003e ).\n\nArguably, in this operation the operands don't really inter-operate; rather this is\ncontrol-flow. Thus perhaps they don't have to be of the same type.\n\nIt would be a spec change, albeit backward-compatible.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
