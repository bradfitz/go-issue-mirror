	"body": "by **arnaud.lb**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIt seems that ResolveIPAddr() can write to random unrelated file descriptors in some\nunknown conditions, at high concurrency.\n\nThe code at [1] does a lot a DNS requests in parallel. At the same time, it also does\nshort connections to a local unix socket (Dial, a few Writes, and Close).\n\nAfter a few seconds, the unix socket's listener is seeing random garbage, presumably DNS\nrequests (I can sometimes see part of domain names in the garbage).\n\nIt looks very much like ResolveIPAddr() is writing to random file descriptor; or that it\nis corrupting some buffer.\n\nTo reproduce, run ./server and ./client. The server should start receiving binary\ngarbage after a few seconds (and logs that to stderr).\n\ngo version go1.1.2 linux/amd64\n\n[1] \u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/arnaud-lb/3af01cdfb6b1ee38c122\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/arnaud-lb/3af01cdfb6b1ee38c122\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
