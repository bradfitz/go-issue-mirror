Any input on this and/or #15707?\r\n\r\nI'm roughly thinking of something like `tls.Config.GetClientConfig(*tls.ClientHelloInfo) (*tls.Config, error)` with more info on tls.ClientHelloInfo, such as ALPN protos. Select items on the returned config would be used for the connection. This hook would be called [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/9c8809f82aa59e0725e93cffb03de863e61cbbae/src/crypto/tls/handshake_server.go#L191) or so.",
