Maybe an explanation why `BenchmarkClosurePtrFromScope` does not alloc would illustrate this nicely - I naively would've expected that to be exactly equivalent in SSA.\r\n\r\n:+1: on the explainer (ran across it on multiple occasions). It'd be interesting to be able to use the output for code highlighting - the only missing part is giving not online line numbers, but also a char range in that line if that's possible. (something like `12:56-89` for line 12 chars 56-89).",
