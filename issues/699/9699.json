	"body": "http://yasm.tortall.net/\r\n~~~\r\nYasm is a complete rewrite of the NASM assembler under the “new” BSD License (some portions are\r\nunder other licenses, see COPYING for details).\r\n\r\nYasm currently supports the x86 and AMD64 instruction sets, accepts NASM and GAS assembler\r\nsyntaxes, outputs binary, ELF32, ELF64, 32 and 64-bit Mach-O, RDOFF2, COFF, Win32, and Win64\r\nobject formats, and generates source debugging information in STABS, DWARF 2, and CodeView 8 formats.\r\n\r\nYasm can be easily integrated into Visual Studio 2005/2008 and 2010 for assembly of NASM or GAS\r\nsyntax code into Win32 or Win64 object files.\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThis support is necessary for yasm based assembly files to be integrated along with regular cgo files. \r\n\r\nCurrently a working code is available https://github.com/minio-io/go/tree/yasm-support , we will be sending a new patch soon to codereview\r\n\r\nOur use case comes from integrating Intel Storage Acceleration library - https://github.com/Minio-io/erasure/tree/golang_restructure ",
