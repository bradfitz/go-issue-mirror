I think the problem is the way we interpret\none of the rules in \u003ca href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc723564.aspx\"\u003ehttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc723564.aspx\u003c/a\u003e, in\nparticular, it says:\n\n\"... If the command name includes a file extension, the shell searches each directory\nfor the exact file name specified by the command name. ...\".\n\nWe only consider etxtensions listed in PATHEXT\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/os/exec/lp_windows.go#32\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/os/exec/lp_windows.go#32\u003c/a\u003e, but, I\nthink, we need to allow for ANY extension.\n\nAlso, it continues to say:\n\n\"... If the command name does not include a file extension, the shell adds the\nextensions listed in the PATHEXT environment variable, one by one, and searches the\ndirectory for that file name.... \"\n\nbut we go and try extensions in PATHEXT\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/os/exec/lp_windows.go#37\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/os/exec/lp_windows.go#37\u003c/a\u003e regardles of\nwhether we have extension in the name already.\n\nI think the fix should be easy enough to make, but, given that we made mistake already,\nI think we should write new test that will verify some of these rules. Perhaps something\nsimilar to TestWinSplitListTestsAreValid from path/filepath package.\n\nWould you like to have a go and make this change? If not, I will do it myself. Just le\nme know.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **go1.2**, **packagebug**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to @alexbrainman._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
