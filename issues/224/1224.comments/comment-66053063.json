I'm not sure the whole idea of the list id is\nwell thought out.  Rather than use a pointer to an otherwise unused byte as an id, how\nabout just use a pointer to the List object itself?  It would be useful for navigation\nas well and could be exported (through a function, I guess.)\n\nAnd, Remove fails silently if ids don't match?  That's bad.  Also, Remove does zero the\nnext and prev links.  No need for that if the id/list pointer is zeroed.  Leaving the\nnext/prev links alone might help some backtracking algorithms, as in dancing links, for\nexample.\u003c/pre\u003e",
