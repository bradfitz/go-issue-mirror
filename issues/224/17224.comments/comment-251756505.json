I don't know what's special about your configuration on your machine that you get extra interfaces, but I do think since eth0 goes away that the unshare call is working.\r\n\r\nI'm going to propose that we change the test to only verify that the # of interfaces decreases, which should indicate that the unshare call did something. I'll send a CL off in a moment.",
