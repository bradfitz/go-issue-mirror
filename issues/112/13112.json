	"body": "The install directory for the gccgo-built go tool when used for tools from golang.org/x/tools/cmd/ is not correct.\r\n\r\nFor example on ppc64le using gccgo from gcc trunk, the following command:\r\n\r\ngo get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/cover\r\n\r\nattempts to install the 'cover' tool in pkg/tool/linux_ppc64le/ under the gccgo install directory, when it should go into libexec/gcc/powerpc64le-linux/6.0.0, which is identified by the string found in runtime.GCCGOTOOLDIR.\r\n\r\nI have a patch to fix this which I will post shortly.",
