It just sorts each partition by isAncestorEq to remove the need to find the maximal dominator each pass through.  \r\n\r\nThe other thing I was trying was to reduce the number of values created in the first place. Every reference to a PEXTERN ONAME (\"moves\" in this case) generates another OpAddr value which all then get removed by cse.  The other large sets of duplicate values for this case are stack addresses for calling runtime.newobject.",
