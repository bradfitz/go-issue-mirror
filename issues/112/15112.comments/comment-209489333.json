I was going to flail around a bit with it anyway :)\r\n\r\nI saw the partial ordering issue after I started coding and then began using the entry value from sdom to provide an absolute ordering.  I just finished up maintaining the sort order to see if it's worth it.  \r\n\r\nI've got a DNR CL 21981 if you wanted to take a look.  I'm on a slowish Macbook so my benchmark times are a little worse in absolute terms, but it's still a ~30% improvement.\r\n\r\n",
