CDATA sections begin with the string \" \u0026lt;![CDATA[ \" and end with the string \"\n]]\u0026gt; \":]\n\nWithin a CDATA section, only the CDEnd string (\"]]\u0026gt;\") is recognized as markup, so\nthat left angle brackets and ampersands may occur in their literal form; they need not\n(and cannot) be escaped using \" \u0026lt; \" and \" \u0026amp; \". CDATA sections cannot nest.\u003c/pre\u003e",
