But profiles are expensive so we can't leave them on all the time. They are\nalso sample based.\n\nGo has expvars for the total time spent on go GC. It would be just as useful to find how\nmuch time we're spending in the scheduler.\n\nIdeally, we should have different metrics for 'cpu time' and 'wall time'.\n\n'cpu time' would be more useful for our use case because we're trying to improve the raw\nCPU cycles used by the server. But I'd guess that must be hard to implement. \n\nIn that case, a metric for the total time spend inside the scheduler (wall time) would\nalready be quite useful.\u003c/pre\u003e",
