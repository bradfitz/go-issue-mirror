Add EscapeText that is like Escape but returns error.\n3. Make Escape the obvious wrapper - still dropping error.\n4. Make Escape description:\n\n// Escape is like EscapeText but omits the error return value.\n// It is provided for backwards compatibility with Go 1.0.\n// Code targeting Go 1.1 or later should use EscapeText.\u003c/pre\u003e",
