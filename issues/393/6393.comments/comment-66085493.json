As far as I can tell we currently don't document the handling\nof .c files at all.\n\nIt's not clear to me where this should be documented.  This isn't a part of the cgo tool\nas such.  It's the go tool that picks up .c (and now .cc) files.  There is an\ninteraction between the go tool and the cgo tool that is not documented anywhere as far\nas I know; the go tool treats .c files differently if the package uses cgo.\n\nHere is what is new in 1.2: if a package uses cgo, then any .cc files will be compiled\nwith the C++ compiler and included in the package.  There is another change that is\nprobably not worth documenting: when linking a binary, if any package uses cgo and has a\n.cc file, then the C++ compiler will be used as the external linker (external linking is\ndocumented as part of cgo internals).\u003c/pre\u003e",
