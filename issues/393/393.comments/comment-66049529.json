If someone wants to correct these,\nfeel free, but *do so with the minimum number of changes*.\nIt won't help to get a code review that rewrites entire\nsections of code gratuitously.  Specific guidelines follow.\n\nFor most cases, it should suffice to use strecpy or utfecpy.\nFor things that accumulate large strings, use smprint and free.\nFor sequences of strcat, use fmtstrinit, fmtprint, fmtstrflush, and free.\n\nGrep for these names to find examples of their usage in the code.\n\nSee \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/contribute.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/contribute.html\u003c/a\u003e for instructions\non how to set up Mercurial for the code review process.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **HelpWanted**._",
