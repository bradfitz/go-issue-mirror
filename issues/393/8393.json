What do you see instead?\n\nI've recently tried on run Go on a Plan 9 machine with 4\ncores (8 threads).\n\nI've noticed all the tests complete much slower than usual\n(2x to 10x), while the overall test phase completes faster.\n\nI compared the same machine, booted as usual (using 8 CPUs)\nand booted with \u0026quot;*nomp=1\u0026quot; parameter (using only one CPU).\n\nIn the first case, I had to increase the timeout to 240s\n(instead of 120s) to prevent the cmd/objdump and runtime\ntests to time out (net/http/cgi is timing out).\n\nHere are the differences:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.diffchecker.com/s0pqagce\"\u003ehttp://www.diffchecker.com/s0pqagce\u003c/a\u003e\n\nFor example:\n\n                  8 cpu      1 cpu\nencoding/gob    11.272s     1.694s\nnet/http        80.028s    17.917s \nruntime        178.234s    97.128s\nunicode/utf8    12.735s     0.950s\n\ntotal (8 cpu)   5.37u  7.83s 428.52r\ntotal (1 cpu)  23.33u 16.27s 567.95r\u003c/pre\u003e",
