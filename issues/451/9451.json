	"body": "It would be nice if clients of the net/smtp package could access the TLS connection state in order to implement server certificate hash checking with STARTTLS.  Currently net/smtp's `(c *Client)` does not expose the `conn` field, which is set during `(c *Client) StartTLS()`.\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.4/src/net/smtp/smtp.go#L154\r\n\r\nAs an example, this is the kind of server certificate hash checking I'd like to do with net/smtp:\r\nhttps://github.com/agl/xmpp/blob/a5b10608a5c441a99c6380efa91d7f4fb517e9c2/xmpp.go#L509-517\r\n\r\nI ended up forking net/smtp in order to access the TLS connection state after STARTTLS, which is a lot of code duplication for such a small change.  If this isn't too esoteric, an additional method on smtp's Client struct could expose the connection state to clients of the package, making server certificate hash verification possible.\r\n",
