The longer answer is \"and Sort contains a call to quickSort which is recursive, and escape analysis punts on recursive functions, and thought I did work on a CL for not punting, it was very, very fragile and did not produce much benefit, so I let it get pretty stale\".  I will try to revive that CL and see if it helps here at all -- if it does, that raises its priority, and if not, then not.\r\n",
