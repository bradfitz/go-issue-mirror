(You can tell just by looking at the generated assembly and see what the 3rd arg to convT2I is.  If it is 0, then it allocates.  If it is a pointer to a stack temp, it doesn't.)\r\n\r\nWith `-m`, we get (among other reports):\r\n```\r\ntmp3.go:6: sortable(a) escapes to heap\r\ntmp3.go:10: f2 sortable(a) does not escape\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I think this has something to do with the analysis.  Maybe because quickSort is recursive and escape analysis gives up?\r\n\r\n@dr2chase ",
