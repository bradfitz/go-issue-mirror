Maybe udp server need this api, but I am not sure.\r\n@ianlancetaylor I only write a udp server(rtmfp server), and I am not sure whether writev is useful for udp servers, I will do some research.\r\n@bradfitz I will write a standalone program for profiling the write or writev. I will rewrite the program [go-writev](https://github.com/winlinvip/go-writev) to use golang code only(the c++ code will move to another branch).\r\n\r\nAbout the api and implementation, for example, to use sendmsg or ReadFrom or MultipleReader, I need some time to study the code.",
