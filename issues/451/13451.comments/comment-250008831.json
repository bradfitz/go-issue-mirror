That's like all the methods which operate on the `netFD`.\r\n\r\n\u003e I guess it looks like we currently also don't promise what will happen if Write is called with a zero-length slice?\r\n\r\nExactly. Zero-length reads and writes have historically been very ill-defined in Go. In general, we promise nothing.\r\n",
