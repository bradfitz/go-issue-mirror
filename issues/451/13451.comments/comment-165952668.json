The code is [go-writev](https://github.com/winlinvip/go-writev#usage)\r\n\r\nWritev(28Gbps) is 10 times than Write(2.2Gbps), it's awesome.\r\n\r\nThe writev is very faster than write by avoid lots of syscall, so go-oryx copy all iovecs to a big-buffer then use write to send(faster than use multiple writes, but make the go-oryx consume lots of memory). For server, the writev can avoid memory copy and make little syscall.",
