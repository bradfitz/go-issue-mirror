	"body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have been running two instances of simple HTTP server hidden behind HAProxy configured to terminate SSL and proxy further decrypted traffic.\r\nUnfortunately, the implementation of http.Server connection handling processes HTTP/2.0 requests only when their TLS protos are manifestly defined (through TLSNextProto).\r\nNow, proxying traffic through HAProxy (mode TCP) finishes with 400 Bad Request while `PRI * HTTP/2.0` cannot be considered as valid Request-Line.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMarcin",
