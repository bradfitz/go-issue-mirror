I suspect people would ask\nalmost immediately for (a) the ability to specify the filename in the source code\nalongside the variable and (b) globbing. Both of these are delicate: (a) to learn the\nfilename, the Go command would need to parse the entire source instead of just up to the\npackage, and (b) naive globbing (into a map?) would require significantly more\ncompiler/linker coordination. This is probably a discussion to have on golang-dev, when\nthe 1.4 floodgates have been opened.\n\nChaishushan: I'm not sure that's the first design I would reach for, but thanks for the\nlink.\u003c/pre\u003e",
