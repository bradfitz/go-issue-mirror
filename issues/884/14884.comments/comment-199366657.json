They are just a compare and branch where the\ndestination is a call to panicindex (or panicslice, for slice bounds\nchecks).\n\nWe could use a -d=bounds to print all the places where a bounds check\nhappens.  We have -d=nil and -d=wb for nil checks and write barriers,\nrespectively.  It might be kind of tricky to implement though.\n\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/14884#issuecomment-199167924\u003e\n\u003e\n",
