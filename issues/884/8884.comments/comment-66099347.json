But there are\nalso m-\u003emcache, m-\u003elocks, m-\u003ep and m-\u003eptr/scalarargs. Duplicating them in G looks bad\nbecause it will bloat G and open door to bugs. While what was called stackguard0 can\nmoved to M rather than duplicated.\n\n\u003e g is also much easier to reason about in programs, because it cannot change from line\nto line as a particular function executes.\n\nIt's true that it can change, but I don't see how naming things differently changes\nsomething. It can change regardless of whether you call it 'm' or 'g-\u003em'. If you want to\nprevent m from changing, you do 'm-\u003elocks++' or 'g-\u003em-\u003elocks++'. No difference (other\nthan additional indirection).\u003c/pre\u003e",
