It is\naccessed once per function call. g is also much easier to reason about in programs,\nbecause it cannot change from line to line as a particular function executes.\n\nEventually I would like to put g back into a dedicated register on amd64, like we do on\narm. Then getting at g-\u003estackguard0 will be just one load, and getting at m will be just\none load too.\u003c/pre\u003e",
