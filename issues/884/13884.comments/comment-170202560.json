But a future perhaps more efficient implementation may lead to a similar unanticipated change of order, with the same effect on code that makes implicit order assumptions. It seems to me it would be better to eliminate those errors earlier than later (or possibly even multiple times).\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to make the experiment. GO16SORTEXPERIMENT=1 could enable it. (disabled by default). That way teams willing to take the plunge can try it out and see if it exposes any real errors. It would be fine to remove again for 1.7 if there's no real benefit.",
