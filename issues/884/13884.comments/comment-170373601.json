	"body": "Would it make sense to have sort (and other potentially-future-different interfaces) behave more randomly under \"go test\", combined with flags to allow you to control where the wiggles are?  That makes testing more aggressive and production more predictable (usually).  So the randomness would be opt-out for testing, opt-in for production.\r\n\r\nIn the SSA code I get a lot of mileage from a hash-based match for where to (not)activate buggy code; I'm not sure how we would do that for APIs, but it would be nifty to be able to isolate the exact buggy call in the same way that I can (now automatically) isolate exactly which function is incorrectly compiled.  Contra that, there's a bit of a learning curve to managing all the random-activation knobs.",
