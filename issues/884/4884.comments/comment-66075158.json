If you ask people to define what 'for {} else {}' would\nmean, there are at least two completely reasonable, yet contradictory, definitions:\n\n1. The else happens if the for does not break.\n2. The else happens if the for does not iterate at all (like range over empty thing).\n\nGiven that there's not even a single obvious definition, I think adding this is a\nmistake and quite unlikely. The other languages need to invent new control structures\nbecause they don't have goto. Go does. :-)\u003c/pre\u003e",
