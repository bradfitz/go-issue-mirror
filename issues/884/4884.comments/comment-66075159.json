Perhaps if it was called something other than \"else\" it would\nmake it more obvious? Then again I am pretty sure that adding a keyword is a harder path\nthan I am already tracking. =)\n\nGenerally I find a bunch of places that I would love to have else (given that golang\ndoesn't have a \"in\" operator either) since it would in turn make my own code much easier\nto follow since the current approach requires moving the condition into the loop\ntherefor breaking the normal \"reading flow\". I used this quite a lot in python, and\ntypically found that people thought it was pretty useful once the saw it used, but I\ntotally understand if its not included given the contention around it. A misunderstood\nfeature is often far worse than a missing feature.\u003c/pre\u003e",
