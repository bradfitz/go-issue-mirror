The answers (even incomplete)\nwill help me a lot.\n\n1. Is this a one-time bug or you spot it regularly?\n\n(I hope it's not one-timer, because in this case, I will have a very nice puzzle to\nsolve)\n\nBelow, I assume that this bug was spotted at least few times and there's no reason to\nbelieve that it won't crash your program again.\n\n2. What's is the period between these crashes? A minute/hour/day/week?\n3. What was the compression level?\n4. What's approximate data input size?\n5. Is it possible to record the data which leads to the crash?\n6. Is it possible to use a modified Go runtime (if provided by Go team) to compile your\nprogram and have more detailed crash report in the next time when this bug appeared?\u003c/pre\u003e",
