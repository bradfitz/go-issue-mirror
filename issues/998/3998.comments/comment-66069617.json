Currently, I have very high expectations to find a\nreproducer tomorrow (after a good sleep). If I failed (which would not surprise me), I\nwould be happy to provide a patch to Go runtime and/or a patch to planfile.\n\n(semi-unrelated) It would be really nice to have an introduction to planfile in\nREADME.md and a short instruction on how to get started. I have spent few minutes on the\nidea to run local tests with planfile-app, but I have given up on reading main():\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tav/planfile-app/blob/master/planfile.go#L611\"\u003ehttps://github.com/tav/planfile-app/blob/master/planfile.go#L611\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
