Instead, Go is always in a read, waiting for it to hang up on you. If it hangs up in the meantime (say, at 5 minutes, per your example), that connection is removed from the pool and not used later in 5.5 minutes.\r\n\r\nIs this a hypothetical bug report or something you're actually seeing?\r\n\r\nIf you're actually seeing it, please provide code and a packet capture.\r\n",
