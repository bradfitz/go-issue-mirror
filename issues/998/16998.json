	"body": "This is a feature request / discussion starter rather than an issue. AFAIK gomobile only generates pure code, but doesn't attach any documentation to the generated classes. I think we could improve heavily on this by taking the docs from the original Go code and trying to move it over to Java/ObjC.\r\n\r\nWas this ever considered, and if yes but decided against, I'd be curious of the reasoning behind it.",
