	"body": "There is a significant advantage to having a single file contain everything, including data, javascript, etc. A standalone file can easily be shared and does not require any special tools to open. If anything, I'd like to see the trace viewer go the other directionâ€”rather than generate a file with the data but still require 'go tool trace' to be running to serve js and assets, I think go tool trace should spit out standalone output.\r\n\r\nI plan to add a -trace flag to cmd/go for 1.8, and in that context, a standalone file is even more important for usability.\r\n\r\nThe bitrot vs the upstream trace viewer code is unfortunate and should be fixed. That's just something we have to maintain.",
