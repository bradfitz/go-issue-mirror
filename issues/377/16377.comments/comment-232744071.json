	"body": "We could have `go tool trace` launch a browser that opens a file written to a temporary location, and `go tool trace -out \u003cpath\u003e` just write the file. Then at least we'd only have a single trace generation code path.\r\n\r\nIn case it's helpful, here's the crud I hacked together when I was last working on this (unstable url): https://github.com/josharian/go/commit/a5a9f7595338afbfd5f814956b17dc60e0bc586e. I'd love to see it done better.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the gerrit CL. Just advance warning, we're in a code freeze, so nothing will go into the tree until it opens for 1.8 (in a few weeks, I think).\r\n",
