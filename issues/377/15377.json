	"body": "In plive.go, we find this comment:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\t\t// In order for GODEBUG=gcdead=1 to work, each bitmap needs\r\n\t\t\t// to contain information about all variables covered by the bitmap.\r\n\t\t\t// For local variables, the bitmap only covers the stkptrsize\r\n\t\t\t// bytes in the frame where variables containing pointers live.\r\n\t\t\t// For arguments and results, the bitmap covers all variables,\r\n\t\t\t// so we must include all the variables, even the ones without\r\n\t\t\t// pointers.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd later:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\t\t\t// Ambiguously live variables are zeroed immediately after\r\n\t\t\t\t// function entry. Mark them live for all the non-entry bitmaps\r\n\t\t\t\t// so that GODEBUG=gcdead=1 mode does not poison them.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut gcdead no longer exists. Do we still need these full and marked live bitmaps? If we do, let's update or remove those comments.\r\n\r\nSee also gcdead-related tests and comments in test/live{,_ssa}.go.\r\n\r\ncc @aclements \r\n\r\n",
