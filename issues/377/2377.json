Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. N/A\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nN/A\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nN/A\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nN/A\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nN/A\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n@ tip (8c6f3c5bae77)\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThe sentence:\n\n\u0026quot;If the type is absent and the corresponding expression evaluates to an untyped\nconstant, the type of the declared variable is bool, int, float64, or string\nrespectively, depending on whether the value is a boolean, integer, floating-point, or\nstring constant:\u0026quot;\n\nshould IMO also mention complex128 as the type for complex constants. Also a line with\nsuch example should probably be added into the section just bellow (after the ':').\n\nCredit j...@webmaster.ms\n(\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/ESRBGFVbWfU/htpZ9-BcBSgJ)\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/ESRBGFVbWfU/htpZ9-BcBSgJ)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
