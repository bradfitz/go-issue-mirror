The case where I ran into this involved a global variable not\nbeing set, instead a new local variable was made.\n\nI would like to see an opt out feature of :=, so you can do v, :err := f() in this way\nyou explicitly say you don't want a redeclaration of the second variable.  This way you\nonly have to put in a special character for the special cases.\n\nAgain I'm a novice user.  I would just like to see a way to use outside scopes, while\nstill keeping the power of :=\u003c/pre\u003e",
