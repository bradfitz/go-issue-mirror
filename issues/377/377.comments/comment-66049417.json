It's also certainly fine for this\nto be closed if it reflects a decision made.\n\nThe point was mostly that it'd be nice to have some feedback on the features proposed\nfor solving the problem, given that there's so much interest on the problem and a bit of\nlove towards a few of the proposed solutions.\n\nE.g. allowing this:\n\n    :v, err = f()\n\nas equivalent to\n\n    var v T\n    v, err = f()\n\nIf you have internally decided this is off the table, it'd be nice to know it, and if\npossible what was the reasoning.\u003c/pre\u003e",
