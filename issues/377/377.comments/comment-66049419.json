This would have a significant disadvantage: blocks would no\nlonger stand by themselves.  However, it would remain possible in most cases to write a\nblock which does stand by itself, by using an explicit \"var\" instead of :=.  It's just a\nthought, I don't know if it really works.\u003c/pre\u003e",
