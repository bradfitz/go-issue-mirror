[branch]@{upstream} is supported since git 1.7.0, which is almost 4 years old: https://github.com/git/git/blob/e923eaeb901ff056421b9007adcbbce271caa7b6/Documentation/RelNotes-1.7.0.txt#L104.\r\n\r\nBased on the bug reports we've gotten over the last few days, regarding these, I'd say we probably support git 1.8+ and we plan to add support to the default git that comes with different OS, see #9283",
