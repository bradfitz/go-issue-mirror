	"body": "by **cgmurray**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nWhy are requests with chunked transfer encoding not permitted in http/cgi? Is this\naccording to the cgi specification? Git sends data (push) with chunked transfer encoding\nand I believe that it's supported in Apache.\n\nSide-note: By disabling the error-check in ServeHTTP chunked requests seems work in\ngeneral but when sending large data, \u0026gt;= 1MB,  in combination with writing the\n\u0026quot;Content-Type\u0026quot; header the request data seems to be corrupted. Any other\nheader, e.g. \u0026quot;_Content-Type\u0026quot; works however.\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.1 darwin/amd64\u003c/pre\u003e",
