In fact, even w/o the dot-import we actually can't be certain whether `len` is the builtin `len` since it might be declared in another file of the package, and gofmt is by design only working on a file-by-file basis and thus cannot type-check the package and resolve an identifier for certain.\r\n\r\nSo in some sense this was always wrong, but in practice, nobody in his/her right mind is going to declare a `len` function (as opposed to a `len` method which might be quite common).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how I got to this code - for sure it's pretty old code. Would need to track down the history of that line to figure it out. Let's blame it on lack of coffee. Fix coming shortly.",
