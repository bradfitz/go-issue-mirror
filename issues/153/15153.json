Thanks!\r\n\r\nWhat version of Go are you using (go version)?\r\ngo version go1.6 linux/amd64\r\n\r\nWhat operating system and processor architecture are you using (go env)?\r\n/\r\n\r\nWhat did you do?\r\nRun gofmt -s on http://play.golang.org/p/9NhvjR24S1\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to see?\r\nI expected s[:len(s)] to be simplified to s{;}\r\n\r\nWhat did you see instead?\r\nIt wasn't simplified.\r\n\r\ngofmt has a special check for dot imports and refuses to simplify slices in that case, claiming that it's impossible to know whether len is referring to the built-in function or not. I don't see how that could be true. Even a dot import will only pull in exported identifiers from a package, and no exported identifier can be called \"len\". Am I missing something here?",
