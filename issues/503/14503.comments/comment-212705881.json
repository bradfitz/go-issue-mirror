	"body": "I encountered the same error on one of my systems, and there was enough information here to attempt debugging. I don't believe this problem is unique to Darwin. It appears that `gomobile init` will use any existing archive file in the 'dl' directory matching an expected filename, even if that archive file has since changed on the hosting server after being originally fetched by `gomobile init` (and therefore may have a different SHA256 checksum than what is defined for the filename in hashes.go).\r\n\r\nI realize this behavior of `gomobile init` is consistent with `go get` (fetch, and don't update unless the -u flag is specified), but maybe the code in init.go could assert an archive file found in the 'dl' directory matches the expected hash defined in hashes.go, and provide an error or recommendation to run with the -u flag (or just re-download the archive file automatically)? \r\n\r\nIf it helps, I documented my debugging session in a forked repository (that Github apparently automatically referenced above) and in https://gist.github.com/aoeu/657386c35131b71893153efe34ec07b4 . Also, if there's a change that could be advised and no one else is already working on it, I can volunteer an attempt at implementing it. (I'm more accustomed to using Gerrit than Github.)",
