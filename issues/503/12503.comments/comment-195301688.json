Moreover, it would probably need certificates for supporting upcoming DNS over TLS and DANE.\r\n\r\nLooks like this proposal makes it possible to place complicated DNS-related packages at x/net repository. I'm happy if we have fancy name/service discovery functionality without replumbing of packages in standard library.",
