	"body": "I just ran in to this issue myself, except a little bit abstracted away from `net.Dialer`. My use-case may be a little weird, but this would come in extremely handy for me if it was also exposed within the `net/http` package.\r\n\r\nI'm writing a utility that's going to talk over TLS to backend systems (HTTP + JSON) and I'm using Consul  to discover the individual backend nodes. The biggest issue is that I don't have all of my system's DNS requests being serviced by Consul, so pulling a configuration from `/etc/resolv.conf` won't really work. I plan on using their port `8600` DNS interface.\r\n\r\nSo I'll end up needing to first obtain a list of IP addresses from the Consul DNS endpoint and then use that IP address in the URL. Following that, I'll need to set the `Host` field on the request so that the TLS validation works. The only downside here is that I end up having to do a network operation at the creation time of the `http.Request` struct instead of when actually invoking the request.\r\n\r\nIf the `http.Transport` struct was modified to support a custom DNS resolver code path, it would make the code cleaner and avoid the upfront network call.",
