I dug git blame, and found that it was removed in:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/commit/604f3751104e655f76e5368a3a4177d58fe1509c\r\n\r\nFWIW, it was added in https://github.com/golang/go/commit/b03a5f66e8f8a6b36c9d67e82d2edc9b3d4076ba.\r\n\r\nI would fix it myself, but I'm not most familiar with this code (in fact, I'm trying to learn/understand it right now, and this invalid comment made it harder). Removing the comment might work, but maybe it's better to refer to the `obj` parameter instead? Someone more familiar with this can resolve it easily, I just wanted to point out the invalid comment. (I would've left a comment on CL, but it's so old that it's on Rietveld, not sure anyone would see it.)",
