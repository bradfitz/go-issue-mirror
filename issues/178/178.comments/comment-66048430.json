You apparently\ndo need to spell out the home directory instead of \nusing the ~ syntax.  The latter is not a real file name,\njust a shorthand often but not always interpreted by the shell.\n\nThe shell will probably meet you halfway if you want to\nwrite $HOME/install/go/bin instead.\u003c/pre\u003e",
