Not everybody likes the colours that you, or some service, pick. \r\n\r\nThey even allow modifying the patterns used for highlighting.\r\n\r\n\u003e What Text Editor you guys using? No any color ? just black and white text?\r\n\r\nThere is a large enough group of programmers that prefer no syntax highlighting whatsoever, among them a large portion of the Go team.\r\n\r\nPersonally I recommend that you use something like greasemonkey, or the equivalent for your browser, and add syntax highlighting to any page you wish. That way, you get to control all aspects of the syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\n\u003e Code highlight can make code more easily to read and understand\r\n\r\nThat is subjective. Also, it is more relevant for languages with too complex syntax. Go is a very simple language syntactically. One shouldn't require colours to tell a few syntactic elements apart.\r\n\r\nAlso, as adg pointed out, the highlighting in your screenshot is inconsistent. It is either not designed for Go specifically, or it is inadequate. ",
