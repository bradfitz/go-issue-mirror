	"body": "Using `go1.7beta2`\r\n\r\nThe pprof tool has at least two TMPDIRs:\r\n* One that it can take from [$PPROF_TMPDIR, and defaults to $HOME/pprof](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/204b6f48c5107d3132033324fd492ca0253568dc/src/cmd/internal/pprof/driver/driver.go#L699-L705). As far as I can tell, this directory is only ever used when pprof is [operating remotely](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/204b6f48c5107d3132033324fd492ca0253568dc/src/cmd/internal/pprof/driver/driver.go#L404-L410). This pprof directory is never deleted after it is used. So if `pprof` is used locally, it keeps generating empty pprof directories in a user $HOME directory and never cleans them up.\r\n* The other temporary directory, it [generates on the fly](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/e9407ae514df7d18e162ce03ebd530fe21aed16d/src/cmd/internal/pprof/commands/commands.go#L192-L203) when it needs to invoke some type of visualizer for HTML, SVG, GIF, etc... pprof [now properly cleans](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/e9407ae514df7d18e162ce03ebd530fe21aed16d) this directory up.\r\n\r\nWhy have two different variations of TMPDIRs? Why doesn't pprof clean itself up?",
