	"body": "I'm sorry but I was wrong in my previous comment about the performance of unaligned loads and stores on power8.  On earlier Power instruction sets unaligned loads and stores were very inefficient but I have since found out that on power8 unaligned loads and stores perform well.  So for now I think the main areas of performance improvement for the memmove are when 1) figuring out if the src and dst overlap (I don't think the current test is always correct and may decide to use backward moves when not necessary) and 2) when moving large amounts of data.  In the second case, unrolling the loop and using dcache hints will help.  I'm doing more experiments and getting input from other power8 developers.",
