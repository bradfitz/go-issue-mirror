I think when copying anything containing pointers, you'll have at least pointer alignment -- maybe if this could be determined at the call site there would be a case for splitting memmove into one that assumes alignment and one that does not (and as we all know by now, if you are copying pointers you _have_ to do it 8 bytes at a time).",
