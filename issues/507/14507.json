	"body": "There is a ppc64(le) specific implementation of memmove in runtime/memmove_ppc64x.s which works well in some cases but found some cases where further improvements can be made and plan to work on those.  On inspection I also have some concerns about the alignment assumptions.\r\n\r\nThere are no alignment checks for the source and destination in this code.  Is there an assumption when using the runtime.memmove function that these pointers will refer to data that is 8 byte aligned?  If the length is \u003e= 8 then it does ldu/stdu regardless of the alignment.  I couldn't find any documentation stating that there is an expectation for the alignment of the source and destination with this function.",
