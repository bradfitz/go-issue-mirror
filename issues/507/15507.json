	"body": "On the back of https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15201#issuecomment-208602586\r\n\r\n\u003e We propose a means by which cmd/go and friends leverage regular files to simulate symlink-like behaviour within a repository during GOPATH package resolution in a platform agnostic way\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1n5y3mZPs_4PjI80a0vZEaHLe7r9PeiiE9xsIrQFT8Is/edit\r\n\r\nThanks to @kardianos for sharing his initial thoughts offline\r\n\r\n_The name \"symlink\" is bound to prompt a good discussion in and of itself: I would hope we can discuss names/naming separately from the crux of the proposal_\r\n\r\n",
