	"body": "It would be nice to have a robust mechanism to tell what version of Go built a particular binary.\r\n\r\nSee go-nuts thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/XIDDj75ngMc\r\n\r\nIf the binary happens to call runtime.Version, then the version of Go is stored in runtime.buildVersion.  If it doesn't call runtime.Version, runtime.buildVersion is dead-symbol eliminated.\r\n\r\nWe could teach cmd/link not to remove this symbol even if it is dead.  Probably better is to just reference runtime.buildVersion from some always-used code (schedinit?).  That way it will always be available in the binary, easily extracted with gdb.",
