That's not fair.  This will probably make me go away,\nwhich is what such a statement is really intended to do, but I go away muttering about\nhow broken go is, and how we all need to work around it.\n\nGiven that go says (more or less) \"everyone should use our build tools\" (and in fact\nmakes it more or less impossible NOT to), and those tools do not work correctly, you can\nperhaps see why I am frustrated by the response?\n\nMy intention was not to stir up a fight, just to vocally +1 an obvious bug and make my\nplea to not close it just because it is hard to fix.\u003c/pre\u003e",
