Just\ndelete all .aar file and replace the build.gradle of the .aar module\ndirectory with what's similar to the\nexample/bind/android/hello/build.gradle.\n\n\n\u003e 3)\n\u003e If I run \"./gradlew gobind\" again, an .aar file gets added again to the\n\u003e project directory, but the .arr file of the subdirectory (which is the one\n\u003e linked to the Android project) doesn't get updated\n\u003e\n\u003e The gradle plugin is new (I checked it in last week) and it seems that it\nneeds proper documentation.\n\nUntil the documentation is available, for now, it may be easier to follow\nwhat the gomobile package doc says - i.e. utilize Android Studio's .aar\nimport, and run 'gomobile bind' tool with -o option to overwrite the .aar\nfile **in your android studio project's aar module directory**. Sorry for\ninconvenience.\n\nâ€”\n\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/11895#issuecomment-126155757\u003e.\n\u003e\n\n\n\n-- \n__\n",
