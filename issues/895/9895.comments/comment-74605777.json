But, for an empty rectangle the position does not matter, it contains no pixels ( as explained here http://blog.golang.org/go-image-package ). If we define the union of two rectangles as the minimum rectangle that contains all the pixels of both, then the union of two empty rectangles should be empty, mathematically speaking it makes more sense. Also practically speaking maybe, if you imagine that you want to calculate the union of a slice of rectangles, you should be able to initialize an empty rectangle as accumulator and then simply iterate over the slice.",
