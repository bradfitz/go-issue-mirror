I ran it on\na large uncompiled tree over the weekend and was pretty annoyed by all the import\nmessages.\n\nAlso annoying, and harder to fix: 'go vet' complains about not being able to import \"C\"\nwhen analyzing cgo programs.\n\nWe need to decide what the model is. My suggestion is that 'go vet' uses as much\ninformation as it has, but doesn't complain that it needs more.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
