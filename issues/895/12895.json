	"title": "x/net/http2: The server should not select a banned cipher if it selects h2",
	"body": "An HTTP/2 capable server that enforces the optional [TLS 1.2 cipher suite blacklist](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-9.2.2) from RFC 7540 should not select one of those ciphers if the protocol selection is h2. A client may advertise both h2 and blacklisted ciphers because it doesn't know anything about the server.\r\n\r\nFor example consider a client such as libcurl that uses nghttp2 and OpenSSL 1.0.2. If HTTP2 is enabled it will send a ClientHello that advertises protocols h2, http/1.1 and ciphers such as [... TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA ...]. The go server currently replies with a ServerHello selecting h2 and the aforementioned blacklisted cipher, which it later bans by default.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nTLSv1.2 Record Layer: Handshake Protocol: Server Hello\r\n    Content Type: Handshake (22)\r\n    Version: TLS 1.2 (0x0303)\r\n    Length: 58\r\n    Handshake Protocol: Server Hello\r\n        Handshake Type: Server Hello (2)\r\n        Length: 54\r\n        Version: TLS 1.2 (0x0303)\r\n        Random\r\n            GMT Unix Time: Jan 21, 2084 01:52:46.000000000 Eastern Standard Time\r\n            Random Bytes: 9dddda38a42111e70f3b934867a054c7a17df8aa27ef5139...\r\n        Session ID Length: 0\r\n        Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc014)\r\n        Compression Method: null (0)\r\n        Extensions Length: 14\r\n        Extension: renegotiation_info\r\n            Type: renegotiation_info (0xff01)\r\n            Length: 1\r\n            Renegotiation Info extension\r\n                Renegotiation info extension length: 0\r\n        Extension: Application Layer Protocol Negotiation\r\n            Type: Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (0x0010)\r\n            Length: 5\r\n            ALPN Extension Length: 3\r\n            ALPN Protocol\r\n                ALPN string length: 2\r\n                ALPN Next Protocol: h2\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nRef bagder/curl#406",
