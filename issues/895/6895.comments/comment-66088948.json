The root cause\nwould be unix-domain socket. It uses filesystem namespace as an endpoint identifier but\nit doesn't support maximum length of filepath (if it exists). And on virtual environment\nlike LXC, choosing unix domain sockets for its IPC is pretty reasonable because it's\neasy (we can use well-known, simple filesystem namespace instead of ephemeral IP\nnamespace) and faster than other domain sockets such as TCP, but TANSTAAFL.\u003c/pre\u003e",
