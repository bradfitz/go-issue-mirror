Strings should never have nil data pointers (unless they have 0 length, which these strings don't).\r\n\r\nIdeally this situation should trigger a better error, maybe a nil pointer panic instead of a \"stack not copyable\" error.  But it is not clear whether any additional code is worth it in cases of corruption.\r\n",
