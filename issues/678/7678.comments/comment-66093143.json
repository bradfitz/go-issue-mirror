I appreciate your finding this problem so\nquickly, I expect it will be okay in v1 but I am still concerned that the error code was\nso lacking in information. I am hoping you can let the problem remain in the v0 of the\nlibrary long enough for the authors of go1.3 to devise some way of reporting the error\nin a bit more informative way, or even detecting the error during compile or link time.\u003c/pre\u003e",
