I reported the problem to both package owners as well\nand they identified and resolved the actual problem in this case. It is of\ncourse difficult for you to write meaningful error messages for errors that\nyou have never seen and never anticipated. I suppose that I was hoping you\ncould improve the error message, perhaps some context seg fault while doing\nsomething, just a clue that would point me to the right direction. No need\nto bloat the code for a rare use case. If there is something simple and\neasy that would make things better for the next person, that would be\ngreat, otherwise, don't worry about it unless it proves to be more of a\nproblem in the future. I was in no position to judge what the nature of the\nproblem was so I just reported it to everyone.\n\nThanks for reviewing my case and thanks for helping to create such a\nwonderful product, I really love Go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
