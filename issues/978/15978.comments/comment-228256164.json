Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nBut I still get\r\n```\r\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\brainman\u003eu:\\test -test.v -test.run=Readlink\r\n=== RUN   TestReadlink\r\n--- FAIL: TestReadlink (0.02s)\r\n        readlink_test.go:35: A specified privilege does not exist.\r\nFAIL\r\n```\r\non Windows XP.\r\n\r\nI am also worried about you using a lot of unsafe code (building Windows structs by writing into binary.LittleEndian). This could introduce memory corruption in \"os\" test binary.\r\n\r\nI would leave test for go1.8. But feel free to send a CL yourself - if others want to proceed with it, I will help along too.\r\n\r\nThanks again. I will stop thinking about this bug now. :-)\r\n\r\nAlex",
