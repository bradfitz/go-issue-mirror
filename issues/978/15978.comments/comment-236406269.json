Microsoft didn't implement it - that makes it this idea even more questionable. Many parts of Windows XP, probably, do not expect \"symbolic links\" to exit. What will users do, if they OS will get confused?\r\n\r\nI think it is bad idea to implement CreateSymbolicLink by hand. Even for testing, this is questionable. But at least we're doing it on OS versions that have CreateSymbolicLink implementation already. And we're doing it in a \"controlled\" environment - during our tests. And I don't see alternative to test our bugs.\r\n\r\nAlex",
