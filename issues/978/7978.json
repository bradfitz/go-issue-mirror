	"body": "by **leterip**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat does 'go version' print?\ngo version devel +b6591f566db4 Mon May 12 17:10:36 2014 -0400 linux/arm\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\nI have created a gist at \u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/zeebo/364a43f3d2ddfb80f9f8\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/zeebo/364a43f3d2ddfb80f9f8\u003c/a\u003e that has all\nthe details for reproducing the problem. It should be triggered by:\n\n0. Be on an ARM machine with Go on tip and OpenSSL from debian wheezy (it probably works\nwith other OpenSSL versions, I just haven't tested) :(\n1. go get -d gist.github.com/364a43f3d2ddfb80f9f8.git.git\n2. go test gist.github.com/364a43f3d2ddfb80f9f8.git.git\n\nWhat happened?\nruntime: unexpected return pc for runtime.starttheworld called from 0xffffffff\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\nPASS\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI've checked for any things related to objects passed into CGO without references in Go\nand I couldn't find anything. There are additional details in the readme.md in the gist\nabout conditions I've found for triggering it. It seems like one of those things where a\nbunch of non-deterministic things have to all happen.\n\nI have been unable to simplify the code in this report any more than it currently is and\nI understand it is quite a bit of code with a large CGO dependency around wrapping\nOpenSSL of all things and I'm very willing to help out with any information I can in\ngetting this resolved.\u003c/pre\u003e",
