This only happens for single primitive values (not for structs) and I think it's an artifact of how the state machine works (i.e. it emits an end-of-struct-tag, even though there never was one).\r\n\r\nAs the 0-byte carries no information, this is probably a bug in the encoder, but as there probably is encoding of this in the wild and gob isn't version, it probably can't be fixed. In that case, the documentation should be updated to include this.",
