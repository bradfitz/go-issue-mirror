Does corruption there sound like a plausible explanation for the crashes we see?\r\n\r\nPossible, but unlikely, corruption of this sort usually comes from data races in the program.\r\n\r\nIf you suspect that your tests do not exercise possible racy paths, could you build a race enabled version of your program and deploy it ? go build -race $PKG will do it.",
