It's in state _Grunning and the wait reason is set, so the same conclusions apply.\r\n\r\n@rhysh, you're right that that last crash is really interesting. What makes it even more interesting is that there's *also* a write barrier on the previous line that would have crashed if g.m was nil on that line.\r\n\r\nThat strongly suggests that either the write barrier itself can somehow clear g.m, or something is concurrently clearing it. It's hard to say for sure, but I don't think any of the other stack traces are obviously incompatible with the theory that the write barrier itself is doing it. Though my hunch is that something is concurrently clearing it since there are so many different stacks and the write barrier itself is fairly deterministic.",
