Then the transport.go\ncode adds the Proxy-Authorization header for you on each request.  You don't do it by\nhand.\n\nAnd your other bug in the final sentence is covered by \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/4800\"\u003eissue #4800\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Invalid**._",
