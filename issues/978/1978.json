Attempt to build go (6g) with a gcc version which is different from what any of the\ndevelopers use, or with different versions of system libraries or tools\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe go compiler successfully builds for the user who wants to use it, possibly printing\nout a couple of new warning messages.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe go compiler fails to build, with a silly error message like\n\ncc1: warnings being treated as errors\ny.tab.c:5203:9: error: passing argument 1 of 'yyerror' discards qualifiers from pointer\ntarget type\n/home/cwalton/Development/go/src/cmd/gc/go.h:1148:6: note: expected 'char *' but\nargument is of type 'const char *'\n\nfrustrating someone who just wanted to try a new programming language.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nCompiling 6g from a mercurial checkout of the release branch as described on the\n\u0026quot;getting started\u0026quot; page\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nExherbo Linux with gcc 4.5.3 and bison 2.5\n\nWhich revision are you using?
