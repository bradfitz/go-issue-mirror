I added some prints and stuff to the\ncode to try to debug further. Here is one such output:\n\nstarting gentraceback(0xffffffff, 0xffffffff, 0x0, 0x10602640, 0, 0x0, 2147483647,\n0x19324, 0x41db8bd0, 0) used from sycallstack=0x404b3fd0 pc0=0x14d24 sp0=0x404b3ee8\npc=0x14d24 lr=0x41f9c fp=0x404b3ef0 sp=0x404b3ee8 argp=0x404b3ef4 arglen=0\nruntime.cgocallbackg\npc=0x41f9c lr=0x41ee4 fp=0x404b3efc sp=0x404b3ef0 argp=0x404b3f00 arglen=12\nruntime.cgocallback_gofunc\npc=0x41ee4 lr=0x26954 fp=0x404b3f00 sp=0x404b3efc argp=0x404b3f04 arglen=8\nruntime.asmcgocall\npc=0x26954 lr=0x11629c fp=0x404b3f00 sp=0x404b3f00 argp=0x404b3f04 arglen=4 exitsyscall0\npc=0x11629c lr=0x11629c fp=0x404b3f14 sp=0x404b3f00 argp=0x404b3f18 arglen=16\ngithub.com/spacemonkeygo/openssl._C2func_SSL_do_handshake\npc=0x11629c lr=0x404b3f01 fp=0x404b3f28 sp=0x404b3f14 \n\nI'm unable to find a shorter reproduction still, but I think this happens when a\ngentraceback is called on a goroutine that is returning from a C-\u003eGo callback in the\ncgocallbackg function right before/after it hits entersyscall. I have no idea if this\ntheory is possible or makes sense.\n\nI have also discovered that if the bio free does not call back into Go, the repro fails\nto fail. Since this clearly doesn't fix the underlying cause, I still think there's a\nbug on the Go side of things here (it doesn't look like there's stack corruption from\nthe C code, but I could be way wrong there too). This commit shows the change:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/spacemonkeygo/openssl/commit/05477109fd870990155ef0806ab04e91312412f\"\u003ehttps://github.com/spacemonkeygo/openssl/commit/05477109fd870990155ef0806ab04e91312412f\u003c/a\u003e\n\nHopefully this information helps, and the offer to set up a debug environment or to\nprovide any information I can still stands. Any suggestions on where to look or\nstrategies used to debug this stuff I'd also gladly accept :)\u003c/pre\u003e",
