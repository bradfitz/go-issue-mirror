	"body": "@mattfarina This is getting a bit off topic.\r\n\r\nAre you aware of \"gopkg.in\"? For example: \"gopkg.in/natefinch/npipe.v2\" It is a proxy service for go packages that uses go tags to make a new import path. Developers can optionally use the package comment to enforce an import path.\r\n\r\nOther examples include \"labix.org/v2/mgo\".\r\n\r\nRegarding kubernetes importing \"go-semver\" 4 times, this is an argument for using the \"vendor\" folder universally and doesn't really have a direct tie in to version numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to discuss this more, start a discussion on go-nuts or https://forum.golangbridge.org/ please. Some of your questions I suspect could be answered with searches on go-nuts as they have been discussed several years ago. Thanks!",
