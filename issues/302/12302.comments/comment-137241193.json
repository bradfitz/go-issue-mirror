I want to be clear that there is an unfortunate confusion between the gb use of the word, and the way I am using it in this context. To say it another way\r\n\r\nPeople work on projects who's source code lives in repositories. So, you release a version of your project, by tagging the repository that holds its code.\r\n\r\nTo avoid confusion, and to make it clear that this is not a proposal driven solely by or for gb, I'll attempt to replace the word Project with Repository in the next draft.\r\n\r\nDaniel, to respond to your concerns that this proposal is pushing a unique or specialised world view, I must respectfully disagree. Source code lives in repositories, tags apply repository wide, so that is the unit of releasing code. This isn't unique to Go, this is a common pattern across many languages.",
