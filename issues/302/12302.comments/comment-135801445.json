	"body": "@vbatts does raise an interesting thing that we might at least consider for this spec. Should this proposal defined what \"v1.2\" and \"v2\" mean? For purely numeric calculations, I have seen the internals of various package managers do some interesting things to give these symbols meaning (`v1 == v1.9999.9999` or `v2.-1`). And since version number comparison is a natural offshoot of this spec, it might behoove us to make an explicit decision now, even if the explicit decision is that the question is out of scope.\r\n\r\nRelated, semver does mention pre-release versions, but only gives \"alpha\" as an example. Is there any use trying to be more explicit here? I think alpha, beta, and rcN are pretty standard.",
