Just use the revision you used before, develop against that and if there were breakages, you need to figure that out either way. I don't understand what you are getting at with that.\r\n\r\n@peterbourgon Note, that I started not by demanding that this should be abolished (though I think it should), but by stating that someone suggesting SemVer should *also* give a definition of what that means. I firmly stand by this, I will be unhappy, but can accept SemVer as an 80% solution, but only if we collectively agree what kinds of changes will require an increment of which version number. Because a simple definition leads to counterproductive version numbers.",
