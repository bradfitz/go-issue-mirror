	"body": "@technosophos @mattfarina thank you for your feedback. To reply specifically to your comments about the `v` prefix. This was _the_ most contentious part of the [discussion on go-pm](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/go-package-management/B-MHT98dvEU/discussion) that preceeded this proposal.\r\n\r\nThe preference for a `v` prefix comes from observations that three of the biggest Go projects, Docker, Kubernetes, and CoreOs all use that variation, it is also widely used by our language contemporaries like Rust, Nodejs and Bower (javascript). With that said, I'm sure an equal number of prominent examples could be found that do not have a `v` prefix.\r\n\r\nIf this proposal were amended to make the `v` prefix optional, would that be acceptable ?",
