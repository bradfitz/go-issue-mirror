	"body": "@mattfarina (not to add to the conversation, just to repeat what I wrote earlier in list form) my concerns are:\r\n\r\n1. A project is limited to a single repository. For example, AOSP has a version number applied to a project spanning a great number of repositories.\r\n- Only one project per repository. A working counterexample is x/tools. Though I'd be happy to see that particular example change to meet the standard, I'm not sure what it will look like and I'm not sure if there are others.\r\n- The unknown unknowns that come from starting with a standard instead of an implementation. (And ideally, multiple implementations using a standard, just as modern web standards are developed.)\r\n\r\nThese are not major concerns, and I believe 1. and 2. ultimately fall under 3., which may also be worth considering in the context of future Go proposals. (This proposal system is after all, new.)",
