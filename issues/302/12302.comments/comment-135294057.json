	"body": "+1 on this proposal. It would be very helpful for a community convention to be established. Today CoreOS projects like etcd, rkt, and flannel, depend on a number of Go libraries. And it would be great if there was an overall community convention to make regular library releases so instead of selecting the version based on what master was whenever our team imported the library with godep we could start relying on a git tag instead.",
