Certain existing repos (notably golang.org/x) are noncompliant, and would need to be split out to conform. This and other ramifications were considered to be acceptable costs for the benefit of the simplifying abstraction.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e If that's so (and I don't see it clearly resolved on this issue's comment history), then I suggest the changes to the code be done and shown to be successful before this proposal is accepted. Then the argument that the definition of project is reasonable will include a list of current projects and successfully converted projects. Ideally with a tool to check them and a site (maybe godoc.org) to track them.\r\n\r\nYou would propose to block the proposal until golang.org/x/* is restructured into independent repos?\r\n\r\nI think it's a fine exercise, but I don't see how it could fail, and I think it'd be a shame to block the proposal until it's finished. Especially given the proposal is opt-in, and seeks only to define a schema, i.e. is agnostic to more concrete details.\r\n\r\n(Or, perhaps I overlook something?)\r\n",
