I think versioning is good, but I also happen to work on a project that versions in exactly this way.\r\n\r\n\u003e With that said, any changes to the go tool are outside the scope of this proposal.\r\n\r\nWithout some hypothetical usages of this convention, it might be hard to justify.  For example, could `go get` HYPOTHETICALLY take a version string and fetch that specific revision?  Could `godep` or `gb vendor` HYPOTHETICALLY take a version to import and/or rewrite imports (gopkg.in style) to versioned?\r\n\r\nThose are more exciting than an abstract convention which, to be clear, is painfully obvious to me (but clearly not everyone).\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n\r\n+1 but how do we USE it?",
