	"body": "A few concerns:\r\n\r\n1. I beleive that incompatible versions of the same library should use different import paths. Otherwise they cannot co-exist as dependencies of a single project. Having them tagged with two different tags is not enough or even harmful.\r\n\r\n   There a lot of examples of Java libraries where following this simple rule would have made life of library and application developers much easier. E.g. protobuf 2.4 vs 2.5, various versions of asm library, hadoop-1 vs hadoop-2, various versions of jetty, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Very often for applications (not libraries) it makes little sense to use semver. Something like build number + git hash works well enough. Think about version numbers of such applications like Chrome, Firefox, systemd, less, etc.",
