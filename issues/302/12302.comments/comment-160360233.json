If I have given that impression, please accept my apologies.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your specific concerns about what defines \"breaking or non breaking change\", I hold it is whatever Semver says, which is clearly stated at the top of the summary section of http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html.\r\n\r\nYou argue that what constitutes a breaking change is much larger than what is commonly accepted, as pointed out by your well written article. As I said above, I agree completely with what you wrote, and see this as a point which tools can help as the rules for \"breaking vs non breaking\" are not ambiguous -- we already have this with the Go api tool, although i think you are arguing for some even more stringent, and that is also fine.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I agree with your points on breaking changes being almost any addition to an existing Go type (sorry if I have not reproduced the depth of your argument), but that seems to me to be tangental to this proposal. This proposal is to adopt _some kind of_ release process -- if there is no release process then arguing about the nuances of the application of Semver to Go APIs serves no purpose.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDave",
