	"body": "\u003e This was discussed on the list beforehand, but indeed, this proposal\r\n\u003e declares that one repo == one project. Certain existing repos (notably\r\n\u003e golang.org/x) are noncompliant, and would need to be split out to\r\n\u003e conform. This and other ramifications were considered to be acceptable\r\n\u003e costs for the benefit of the simplifying abstraction.\r\n\r\nIf that's so (and I don't see it clearly resolved on this issue's comment history), then I suggest the changes to the code be done and shown to be successful before this proposal is accepted. Then the argument that the definition of project is reasonable will include a list of current projects and successfully converted projects. Ideally with a tool to check them and a site (maybe godoc.org) to track them.\r\n\r\nNone of these steps require a proposal be accepted, and I believe would be valuable in helping prove out any proposal.",
