	"body": "\u003e So what does the implementation of this look like? \r\n\r\nI imagine the implementation would be a design document in the proposal repo, like the security policy.\r\n\r\n\u003e Where would the convention be documented? \r\n\r\nIn the document above.\r\n\r\n\u003e Would it be enforced by the Go tool chain somewhere? \r\n\r\nNot at the moment. Releasing code is outside the purview of the go tool at the moment and go get has no capabilities to choose which tag to check out at the moment. However, there are many other tools, both in the Go sphere, and outside, that consume Go projects and will benefit from being able to identify released versions of Go projects.\r\n\r\n\u003e Is this analogous to the vendor-spec proposal?\r\n\r\nNot directly. The vendor spec is about recording what is vendored into the local copy. This proposal is about providing a way for Go project owners to indicate which revisions of their repository they want to be considered \"released\", in the same way that we develop Go on master, but tag a specific revision when it's ready to be released.",
