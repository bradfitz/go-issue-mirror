	"body": "To repeat myself again: My suggestion was primarily to at least define what constitutes a \"breaking change\", or rather a \"non-breaking change\". I don't understand why this should be impossible or conflict with the target of using Semantic versioning, in fact I would think that it would *promote* the introduction of SemVer. I have strong opinions on the merits of SemVer, yes, but I agreed to disagree on those from the very beginning. But so far no one has even attempted to give this definition, acknowledge it's necessity or to give a reason to *not* give such a definition. Clarity on what constitutes a breakage seems like a hard requirement for introducing SemVer to me, because after all the spec references this term and only makes sense after this term is clear.\r\n\r\nI am going to leave this discussion now, because I feel unwanted and ignored.",
