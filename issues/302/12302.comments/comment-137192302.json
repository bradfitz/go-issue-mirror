	"body": "@crawshaw The Go community is fairly immature when it comes to the infrastructure around projects. Many other language communities, working for a number of years, have come to more robust supporting tooling that supports the needs of their communities.\r\n\r\nTake a look at something like [Packagist](https://packagist.org). For example, see the [Symfony project listing there](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony). That's right, I'm saying that the PHP community has better surrounding tooling for packages than Go. Though, they've had many more years to get to it.\r\n\r\nThere are a bunch of tools you can use today. See the [wiki on Go package managers](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/PackageManagementTools). I can speak for Glide that already deals with versions and plan to support SemVer in the near future. We planned on that even before this issue and proposal because we had people request it.\r\n\r\n@ChrisHines gopkg.in is interesting. I like it to a point. Discoverability and packages not on GitHub are an issue.\r\n\r\nGo needs to step up it's game in the Package space. I'm not suggesting that the Go core toolchain do it all. This proposal is the first step in a better direction.",
