Luckily `go get` already defines the rules for what is a remote package and how it is fetched, so questions of ownership can be punted to a 3rd party. \r\n\r\nWho owns the github.com/docker/docker project, and thus the github.com/docker/docker/... namespace  ? It's who controls the docker repository on the docker account at github.\r\n\r\nWho owns the golang.org/x/tools project ? It's whoever controls the dns name for golang.org and can host a web server to serve a meta redirect.",
