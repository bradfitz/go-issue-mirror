Whereas I am saying \"use semver tags, don't get it wrong\", you are proposing that a tool manages the version number. For example, some mythical release tool, `go tool release`, to make up something entirely.\r\n\r\nYou would run `go tool release` at some point in your development cycle, probably at the point you want to cut a release, or regularly to make sure you can predict its output, and the tool would inspect your working copy with respect to your last MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH releases, then the tool would tell you, based on the visible API changes (nil, additions, or subtractions/changes) what your next version number should be, and possibly it even handles the mechanics of doing that.\r\n\r\nDepending on your point of view this might be a recommendation, or it might be a flat out assignment of a version number.\r\n\r\nHopefully I'm not completely wrong in this interpretation, and if so, then I think we're probably a lot closer than originally assumed; I want a mechanism to tag Go repositories, and you want a mechanism to assign those tags, strictly.",
