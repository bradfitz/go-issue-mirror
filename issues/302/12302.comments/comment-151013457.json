I had mis-read @minux statement and attempted to \"correct\" it, when in fact he was simply saying \"I think they could co-exist\" (Sorry @minux).\r\n\r\nGo2 by definition will make all old go code incompatible.\r\n\r\n`I'm just trying to pluck out a practical path forward for the long tail of developers.` We are all trying to improve things. I'm glad we are all on the same team.\r\n\r\nI'm glad you have experience with other package managers. Many others, including those on the go team also have over a decade of experience with such: http://search.cpan.org/~bradfitz/ . Each perspective is unique. I'm glad you are sharing your perspective.\r\n",
