I'm still not even sure it's a good idea, in large part because one way I evaluate whether something is a good idea is to understand its effects, and this proposal has no direct effects.\r\n\r\nBuild a system that uses semantic versions effectively. Demonstrate what great tools can be built. Give people incentives, and they will tag their releases no matter what the Go team says. Certainly the Go team saying \"you should do it this way\" has not in the past been successful without these things (think not-vendoring).",
