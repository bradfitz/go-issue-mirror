In theory that may work but the reality of projects, branding, and common existing practices mean that's not a reality.\r\n\r\nI wonder how much of that idea comes from the Google way of handling packages that is different from the way the long tail handles it?\r\n\r\nAs for the 'v' prefix, this is one place the Go way will deviate from SemVer. SemVer does not use the 'v' prefix and it's been noted that if it's there to ignore it in the implementations out there. The 'v' is a deviation from the SemVer spec. I'm not disagreeing with the deviation, just making sure it's noted.",
