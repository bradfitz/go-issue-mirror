	"body": "This looks like the early days of ruby on rails. Before having [bundler](http://bundler.io/), we had to put dependencies in /vendor/plugins. It lasted for some years, then [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/) became the standard. The dependencies were defined in the code, and a rake task was used to install the deps: `rake gems:install` (\u003c= search for issues with that on google...)\r\nIt introduced a lot of issues, because the gem (ruby packages) were installed using the application itself. Of course, sometimes, the app couldn't load enough code to install the gems, and the user was stuck.\r\nThen, bundler was designed, an independent tool, reading one config file (Gemfile). The locked versions are saved to Gemfile.lock, and installed most of the time in a dedicated \"gemset\" (a GOPATH).\r\nI writing all of this, because it seems go is heading the same way, and will spend months/years to adopt what the other languages figured out in the last years ;)\r\nWhat go could do better, is the namespace of packages, because the source of the package is obviously explicit. There's no need for a central registry, VCS tags are more than enough.",
