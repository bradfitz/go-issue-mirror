Should that be required or optional?\r\n\r\nI looked and npm (for Node.js) and composer (for PHP) the `v` is optional. In others such as Cargo (Rust) or Bower (JavaScript) I don't see any mention of `v`. It appears to not be used.\r\n\r\nThere are Go projects with and without the `v` prefix today. Can it be optional?\r\n\r\nAs one of the developers of [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide), another package manager, I can say that handling this well is already a request and need.\r\n\r\nGoing beyond issues, such a distros, you can see what version of the project/package API you're using. If I've used a package who bumped their API version from 1.2.3 to 2.0.0 I need to know this because the API contract changed. Versioning can help with the API contract and expectations.",
