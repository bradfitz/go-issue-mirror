Adding\na mutex here adds overhead for little gain.\n\nExperiments running your program show the problem happens when the logging destination\nis slow, such as writing to disk.  Fast consumers seem to alleviate the problem.   I\nsuspect what's going on is that with this much logging going on, buffers are filling up\nand the program is being rescheduled mid-write.\n\nIf you can demonstrate the problem with modest logging volume a mutex might be the only\nanswer, but I would categorize this problem as a kernel issue regarding resource\nexhaustion by an extreme program and not worth addressing in the library code.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
