Admittedly the maximum message rate was quite high, but I don't\nthink that's too unusual.\nIf log isn't reliable when writing to disk or to a tty, there's something wrong IMHO. I\nagree that it's a kernel issue - writing to a pipe *should* be atomic regardless of the\nspeed of the reader, but it's still an issue.\n\n- If the volume of messages is low, then a mutex will add negligible overhead; if the\nvolume of messages is high, then you'll need a mutex anyway.\u003c/pre\u003e",
