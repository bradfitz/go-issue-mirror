The current implementation maps null to 0\nfor any number type, which means there is no way to tell \"0\" and \"null\" apart in the\nresult, which isn't perfect anyway. Maybe decoding 'null' should fail for ints.\n\nWe could of course also use strings for encoding the three special cases. And just\nrefuse to decode 'null' for numbers, if we can live with differing a little bit from the\nECMAScript behavior on the encoding side (decoding doesn't happen in ECMAScript anyway,\nthey basically just evaluate JSON strings).\u003c/pre\u003e",
