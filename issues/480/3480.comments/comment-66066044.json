I can think of two options:\n\na) unmarshalling any \"null\" back into NaN seems at least somewhat sensible\n\nb) don't support unmarshalling \"null\" back to a float at all, only support marshalling\n(return an error when encountering a \"null\" value for a float field)\n\nBut I'm not sure I can appropriately judge the implications of either option.\u003c/pre\u003e",
