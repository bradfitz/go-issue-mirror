	"body": "Context: https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/10\r\n\r\nI think web crawler task is harder than it looks. I saw a lot of solutions and all of them are wrong, even the [official one](https://github.com/golang/tour/blob/master/solutions/webcrawler.go).\r\nIn order to prove that I have written [some tests](https://github.com/amorgun/go-tour-crawler) and script to run them on multiple solutions. You can see results [here](https://travis-ci.org/amorgun/go-tour-crawler/builds/111213009).\r\nI suggest adding these tests to the task the same way as in the [word count task](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/20).",
