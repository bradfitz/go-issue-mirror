	"body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nSorry for the delay on replying as I was on vacation and didn't get to check this.\r\n\r\nI have done and upgrade on my debian (strecth) and tried compiling again and this time no errors appeared and everything is working as it should with 1.5.3. I didn't change anything else, just updated the debian and then compile from sources. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I saw is that one of the packages updated was the debian package for go, my guess is that this package in debian (being testing) still had this bug and while I tried to compile from source (needed to add more options than the ones in the debian package) this error showed. This seems to have been fixed on the debian side and now Im able to compile go from source without issues.\r\n\r\nThanks everybody for looking in to this, and sorry for the trouble.",
