	"body": "We need to document signal states but also other details. For example, what happens if C registers a signal handler and then Go does? What happens in the reverse order? Is it different for cgo vs c-shared? And so on.\n\nThese issues - in no particular order - are all about signals, and some would be cleared up by such docs (others are plain bugs):\n\n  - #13042 runtime: signal handling: c-shared libraries intercepts SIGCHLD and crashes\n  - #12096 runtime: signal.Ignore not work for SIGTRAP\n  - #13034 runtime: signal_amd64x.go:76 SIGINT on darwin/amd64 causes segfault under c-shared library\n  - #12516 runtime: throw in linked c++ library causes app crash even if caught, on windows platform\n  - #13028 runtime: linking a c-shared library disables the C main() SIGINT handler\n  - #13164 os/exec: Start sometimes creates processes with signals blocked with go1.5 on OSX\n  - #8953 runtime: SIGCONT and SIGTSTP aren't handle-able\n  - #12465 runtime: c-shared with LD_PRELOAD does not work for some programs\n  - #7227 runtime: crash when C library resets sigaltstack/sigaction settings\n  - #12498 runtime: deadlock due to blocked glibc-internal signals\n  - #13363 runtime: nil pointer dereference in sigtrampgo\n  - #4391 runtime: unable to use SIGSTOP to background",
