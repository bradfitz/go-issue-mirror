This is\nfine for the usual /tmp usage, where all the files in that directory are temporary files.\n\nHowever, for e.g. replacing a state file ~/.foo.json with a new one, what I'd want is\nwriting to e.g. ~/.foo.\u0026lt;RANDOMNESS\u0026gt;.tmp and renaming that over ~/.foo.json. This\nway I can make e.g. backup and editor software ignore *.tmp files, and even clean old\nleftover temp files automatically.\u003c/pre\u003e",
