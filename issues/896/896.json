	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eMOVLQZX (MOVSXD without a REX prefix) can only write to\na register, so it can always be spelled MOVL instead,\nbecause MOVL into a register always clears the top 32 bits of the register.\nOther tools (e.g., gcc) only use MOVL, never MOVLQZX.\n\nThe only benefit we get from saying MOVLQZX instead\nof MOVL is that the linker will refuse to assemble a \nMOVLQZX into a memory location, while MOVL into a\nmemory location will work (and only set 32 bits).\n\nEither 6l should change to emit the MOVL encoding for\nMOVLQZX or 6c and 6g should change not to use the \ninstruction.  Probably the latter.\u003c/pre\u003e",
