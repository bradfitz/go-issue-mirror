	"body": "by **daniel.r.heath**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI'm trying to use prepared statements in a reasonably concurrent web app via\ndatabase/sql.\n\nEach goroutine handling a request needs to make one of a small set of queries to the\ndatabase.\n\nUsing prepared statements (prepared before the request starts) would help keep overall\nlatency down. \nHowever, preparing a statement takes the database connection out of the pool.\n\nWhat I'd like to do is register a 'creating connection' handler, and attach prepared\nstatements to each connection when it gets created. \n\nThis seems like it would be the lowest latency approach since each web request would\nhave prepared statements ready to go on its connection.\u003c/pre\u003e",
