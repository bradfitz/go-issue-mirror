	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.4 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nLinux and amd64. This is on a Travis CI machine.\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\nAttempted to `go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports` with Go 1.4.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\ngoimports installing.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n`github.com/lib/pq` `travis.yml` errors out when building against Go 1.4 because its installation of goimports can't find `runtime/trace`.\r\n\r\nI made sure it built against the latest goimports by dropping an extra `-u` in there. You can see an example failed build at \u003chttps://travis-ci.org/jmhodges/pq/jobs/156090817\u003e as well as that build's [travis.yaml]( https://github.com/jmhodges/pq/blob/292e0664f9d84e2e26de2e1835644ebacd360e26/.travis.yml). I'm not sure why there's an implicit `gc` build flag on that version, though? Or maybe build flags were introduced later than I thought?\r\n\r\nI'm working on a workaround for `pq` in case this gets closed if 1.4 is no longer supported by the tools repo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
