It's not clear how MergeLine should be changed: I don't think we want to silently do nothing if the *File receiver is nil as that would hide errors. So we could only silently return if both the *File receiver is nil and the line number is 0. But that seems odd, too.\r\n\r\nPlease re-open if you have strong counterarguments. I don't know that MergeLine is used all that frequently, and having callers making sure that the incoming *File and line are correct seems ok.",
