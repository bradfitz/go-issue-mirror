Clearly they realized that \\e is a\nuseful sequence, even if it's not part of C99 (like a lot of other language extensions).\n\nAnd you're right, not all languages support \\e. But every one that I tried off the top\nof my head (Ruby, Python, Perl, bash, and C without -pedantic) all support it. Is there\nany particular reason not to support \\e, besides the fact that C99 doesn't?\n\nAnd yes, I do know I can write \\x1b and \\033. But I can also write \\x0a or \\012 for\nnewlines, and yet I choose to write \\n because it's simpler and more obvious to the\nreader.\u003c/pre\u003e",
