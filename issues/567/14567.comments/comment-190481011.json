There are maybe 4 or 5 kinds of stack, leads to segfault or dead loop.\r\nBut when I use GDB to run the docker, in maybe 100 times, there are one run successfully!\r\nall faults are in proc.c, i checked the registers when segfault, the register's content is illegal but use gdb to print the value of which load in the register is right. the content in register is wrong,  the value of c code is right.\r\nIs there maybe bugs when golang do schedule? what does schedule do, it will save and recover register?",
