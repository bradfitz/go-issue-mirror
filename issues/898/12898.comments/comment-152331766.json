	"body": "Looks like an upstream issue with LLVM/compiler-rt: https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=24155\r\n\r\nA fix was pushed earlier this month (Oct 2015), it will likely be shipped with 3.8.0 (no backport to 3.7 given the API breakage). I've proposed a backport for Arch Linux users: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/46913\r\n\r\nI don't see any similar bug for Ubuntu at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/llvm-toolchain-3.6/+bugs, you could report it if you find it useful. I have not checked whether the patches apply to 3.6 though.",
