	"body": "Actually, the fact that we generate write barriers for writes to up-pointers is incredibly useful. I was wrong that we ignore these write barriers: the slot may be in the stack, but if it's a write barrier we care about, the pointer will point to the heap and we'll grey the object. This is exactly what we need to handle up-pointers. Hence, we can put stack barriers between any two frames on the stack without worrying about up-pointers.",
