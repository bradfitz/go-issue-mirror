I'm trying to figure out of this discussion is tracking what the user facing API offered by the stdlib should be, or the underlying implementation, or something else completely? (like the viability of even supporting this?).\r\n\r\nAssuming we're still discussing what uses might want from the `sql` pkg API ...\r\n\r\n\u003e What if you maintained a savepoint to nest level mapping in your driver and then translated the name into the appropriate tx to rollback.\r\n\r\nWhat option 1 proposes (see beginning of thread) are the API level changes we might need to support nested transactions. Its up to the driver to either emulate nested txns using savepoints, or maybe use true nested txns if supported by the database. I'm assuming the user facing API for this should allow for this kind of usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx1 := db.Begin()\r\n// do some stuff\r\ntx2 := tx1.Begin()\r\n// more stuff\r\ntx2.Commit()\r\ntx1.Commit()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis API would allow for the txn object (or maybe the driver) to track any names it may have generated for the savepoints and the appropriate rollback logic.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
