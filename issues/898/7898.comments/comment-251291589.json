Thank you for bringing it to my attention.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the CL, it seems like the API presented by the database/sql pkg would need me to begin a transaction before I can use savepoints. This means that when the txn is created, a BEGIN is issued (because at that point the driver must begin a transaction on the underlying db), and then subsequently multiple SAVEPOINTS may be issued.\r\nA couple of reservations about this...\r\n- the user knows that he/she is only interested in using SAVEPOINTS, so why is he/she asked to begin a transaction? (this is what the original proposal tried to avoid by leaving the implementation to the driver, and only leaving the user to have to deal with a single concept - \"transactions\").\r\n- I'm not familiar with many databases, but I can imagine there might exist one that suggests that transactions and savepoints be used in a mutually exclusive manner? (This would make the driver implementors life pretty difficult, I think)\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
