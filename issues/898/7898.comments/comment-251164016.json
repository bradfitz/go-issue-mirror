I don't see how this enables nested transaction support, which is what this issue is about.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, even though a particular database supports nested transactions, but not savepoints, like for example [QL](https://godoc.org/github.com/cznic/ql#hdr-BEGIN_TRANSACTION), the new API in `driver.go` seems to be not compatible with such databases capability. I'd be glad to be wrong, perhaps explain the mechanism to me, TIA. \r\n\r\nI'm sorry to comment this late on the issue, but the subscription to notifications for issues filled before moving to Github were lost in the transition (known issue).",
