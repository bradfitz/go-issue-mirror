	"body": "See https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11845\r\n\r\nThe template package is being blamed (unfairly in my opinion) for issues around SIGPIPE, but there is a fair point to be made: The template package should make it easy to distinguish errors caused by execution from errors caused by I/O. The former is a programming problem that should be fixed; the latter is just bad luck. A conscientious program (like cmd/go) could act differently in the two cases.\r\n",
