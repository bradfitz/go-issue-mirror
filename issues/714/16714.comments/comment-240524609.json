	"body": "@jbardin Thanks for pointing that out.  That explains it.  It's not a finalizer goroutine (which indicates its status with \"finalizer\").  It's a spare goroutine that is created for any Go program that uses cgo in case a thread started by C code calls a Go function.\r\n\r\nSo this is completely normal.  I will leave this issue open to make it appear less odd in a stack trace, such as by using a function other than `goexit`.  For the record, it can be seen by running the above trivial program with `GOTRACEBACK=system`.",
