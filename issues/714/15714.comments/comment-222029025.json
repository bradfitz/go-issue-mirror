	"body": "I looked now.  The problem is that the binary was linked as a PIE.  The profiling data records the PC values for the executable as it was run, which have nothing to do with the addresses in the binary itself.  For this to work the pprof tool needs to know the base address of the executable when it is run.  Or, the profiler needs to record PC values as an offset from the load address.  This must be a known problem but off hand I don't know what the usual solution is.\r\n\r\n@mwhudson For 1.7 do you want to try changing  buildTestProg to pass -extldflags=-fno-pie?  Unfortunately we can't do that unconditionally, we can only do it if it works.",
