I've attempted to setup a cross compile\ntoolchain on OS X for linux, both on am64 with the following commands from the go tip\nrepo:\n\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=1 CC_FOR_TARGET=/opt/local/bin/x86_64-elf-gcc\nCXX_FOR_TARGET=/opt/local/bin/x86_64-elf-g++ ./make.bash\n\nAfter building I attempted to build source of a project which imports a library that\nuses CGo using the following command:\n\nCGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build\n\nAnd get the following result:\n\ngo build runtime/cgo: cannot use cgo when compiling for a different operating system\u003c/pre\u003e",
