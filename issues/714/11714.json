	"body": "A typical day for me starts with:\r\n```\r\n$ cd $GOROOT/src \u0026\u0026 git pull --ff-only --rebase --prune --all \u0026\u0026 CC=clang CXX=clang+\r\n+ bash all.bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a while now the standard library rebuilds upon the next go compile.  This used to be not the case but a few months back this changed somehow (I know, should have reported it then).\r\n\r\nThis is fine when doing \"go install\" but not when doing \"go build\" or \"go test\" because the standard library needs to be rebuild every time and it slows things down quite a bit.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see the old behavior come back that after installing go tip I don't need to manually reinstall the standard library.",
