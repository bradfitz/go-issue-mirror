Unlike most of the performance and other stuff we're trying to\nshake out right now, functionality such as XML parsing can be provided\nby go get-able libraries as a stopgap until Go 1.2.\n\nMore comments specific to CL 7379049 on the CL.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **go1.2**, removed **go1.1**._\n\n_Owner changed to **---**._",
