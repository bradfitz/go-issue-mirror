	"title": "cmd/compile: 1.5 beta 2 can't handle CRLF terminated go system source",
	"body": "The easiest way to reproduce is to change all the .go files in go/src/  (just go/src/runtime is fine) to be CRLF terminated instead of LF terminated.  Since we check our build tools into source control, this happens as soon as a developer on a Windows machine fetches the tools.\r\nUpon building something that makes go install want to rebuild system libs, you'll get errors like this:\r\n```\r\n# runtime\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/cgocall.go:144: args escapes to heap, not allowed in runtime.\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/chan.go:91: t escapes to heap, not allowed in runtime.\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/chan.go:290: c escapes to heap, not allowed in runtime.\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/chan.go:577: t escapes to heap, not allowed in runtime.\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/chan.go:627: t escapes to heap, not allowed in runtime.\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/env_posix.go:34: arg escapes to heap, not allowed in runtime.\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/env_posix.go:45: arg escapes to heap, not allowed in runtime.\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/extern.go:119: rpc escapes to heap, not allowed in runtime.\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/hashmap.go:272: t escapes to heap, not allowed in runtime.\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/hashmap.go:320: t escapes to heap, not allowed in runtime.\r\n/usr/local/go/src/runtime/hashmap.go:320: too many errors\r\n```\r\nThis looks like the same issue that was supposedly already fixed in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9281\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue in 1.4.",
