So, in the general case, what you are doing is not expected to work.\r\n\r\nHowever, it does seem to me that the compiler should support the specific case of magic comments in files with CRLF line endings.  The Go spec says that carriage returns are ignored.  The Go spec does not discuss the special case of magic comments, but it seems to me that for them too carriage returns should be ignored.",
