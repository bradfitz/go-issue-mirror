Either gcc is generating objects with duplicate symbols\nor the Go linker is misinterpreting the symbols as global when they are really static\n(more likely). External linking might help but I thought that was already in place.\n\nIf you write your own wrapper for __aeabi_dcmpge and make both places refer to that\nwrapper I think everything will be fine. For example:\n\n/*\n#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;\n\nvoid mydcmp(void) {\n    __aeabi_dcmpge(0, 0);\n}\n\nstatic void Print() {\n        mydcmp();\n        printf(\"hello\\n\");\n}\n\n*/\nimport \"C\"\n\nand\n\n/*\n#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;\n\nvoid mydcmp(void);\n\nstatic void Print() {\n        mydcmp();\n        printf(\"world\\n\");\n}\n*/\nimport \"C\"\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-none**, **suggested**, removed **release-go1.3maybe**._",
