I believe that no one ensures that it accomplishes within 5 mins. Did you check that there's no remaining processes created by the script when you killed the first run? Did you check that the crashed go command is created by which parent process? Please do not interrupt the shell run unless you are sure what you are doing, and please run the script until crash. Thanks.",
