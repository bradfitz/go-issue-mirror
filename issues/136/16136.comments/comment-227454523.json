	"body": "This is failing with signal 10, which is `SIGBUS`.  The address and the PC value are the same, suggesting that the program has branched to non-executable code.  The address is in the heap, so it is naturally non-executable.  The question is why and how the program branched to that location.  This can only be memory corruption of some sort.\r\n\r\nThe stack trace seems to show that `syscall.ForkLock` is held at the point of the crash, but I don't see any goroutine actually doing a fork/exec.  I see a goroutine starting a fork/exec.\r\n\r\nHolding the fork lock suggests this may be related to #15658, another FreeBSD issue that somehow involves the fork/exec code.",
