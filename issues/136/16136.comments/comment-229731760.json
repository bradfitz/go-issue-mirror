This version of the error just looks like memory corruption.\r\n\r\nIf there is a problem in the Go distribution, I think it must be in the fork support on FreeBSD.  @sapiens-sapide The original report says you are running FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE-p9.  @mikioh Which exact FreeBSD version are you trying?\r\n\r\nHas anybody been able to reproduce this on a second machine?  Could there simply be something wrong with the single machine showing the problem?",
