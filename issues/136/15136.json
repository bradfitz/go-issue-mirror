What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n`go version devel +eb876dd Tue Apr 5 17:41:47 2016 +0000 freebsd/amd64`\r\n\r\n2.

What did you do?\r\n\r\nAttempt to use `syscall.Mlocall` on FreeBSD.\r\n\r\nThe work has been done and it's sitting in Gerritt waiting to be merged, but seems like it's lost in the fray.  I'm creating an issue to keep track of this patch.  Getting `mlockall(2)` and friends added to FreeBSD (and other BSDs) is important in order to support projects that should keep sensitive data off disk (i.e. Vault, https://www.vaultproject.io).  In an ideal world this code would land in time for the 1.7 release.\r\n\r\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/1921\r\n",
