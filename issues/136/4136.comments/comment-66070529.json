I\nthink two very important examples would be encoding and decoding a string, since people\nwho come from other programming languages are very to that. The simple encoding of a\nstring would be:\n\n// Encoding\ndata := \"a string to be encoded\"\nenc := base64.StdEncoding\nencLength := enc.EncodedLen(len(data))\ndst := make([]byte, encLength)\nenc.Encode(dst, []byte(uniqueID))\nencodedData := string(dst)\n\nAnd I still don't know how to decode it (to be fair, have not tried it, if I have the\ntime I'll look at the docs again and post it here)\u003c/pre\u003e",
