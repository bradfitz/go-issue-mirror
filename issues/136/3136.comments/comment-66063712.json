I was under the impression those scripts were slightly\noverkill and that re-running ./make.bash with an alternative GOOS/GOARCH would suffice.\nI know realize that it's probably make.bash that is cleaning up the things I need. (It\nalso ends up rebuilding host tools each time which makes it much slower than it needs to\nbe).\n\nThanks, I'll just adjust my scripts to follow more closely what yours do.\u003c/pre\u003e",
