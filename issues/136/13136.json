This seems reasonable to me, but means that assembly that works under -buildmode=exe will not work under -buildmode=shared (see the discussion on http://golang.org/cl/16385).\r\n\r\nShould we have a builder that runs the standard library tests compiled with -buildmode=shared? What about c-shared and c-archive?\r\n\r\ncc @ianlancetaylor @bradfitz ",
