Having some\nmechanism to find out what the command line used to run the go program is very useful if\nfor nothing other than help messages. There is some jank to make this slightly easier,\nbut this is something that I feel should be in either a variable, or accessible in some\nway to the program since its something that every other language provides.\u003c/pre\u003e",
