	"body": "Per @junyer, the problem here is the use of FindAll. The linear in m and linear in n (=m) applies to a single match attempt. In this case the match attempt scans the entire string in order to decide that there is no match except the empty string. And then FindAll steps forward one byte and tries again. So you have m^2 for each match attempt, as promised, and then m match attempts as well. Mystery solved. We may still be able to do a little better, but that particular cubic (really quadratic) is unavoidable.",
