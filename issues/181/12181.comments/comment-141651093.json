	"body": "Some user feedback:\r\n\r\nFor the second case (Go libraries used by apps) I would not recommend having a `gomobile test` option, based on my personal experience. For Go code used by native code, if a test is not written in the native language it will not exercise the boundary between Go and the native language. If we don't need to exercise this boundary, then a pure go test is sufficient. If not we will need tests written in the native language. There are a number of existing test frameworks which are geared to doing this. They fit well within the development workflow for those languages and I don't see anything gained by adding a third tool. Hope this is useful!",
