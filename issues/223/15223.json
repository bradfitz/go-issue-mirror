	"body": "Hey guys!\r\n\r\ngomobile is great, and we've done some cool things with it so far.  \r\n\r\nWe build a single aar and framework from our code, but I have a question.  Is it possible to send in some optimizations (perhaps to remove unused symbols)?  The size (particularly of the framework), more than doubles our app size.  The compiled size of the framework is about 32Mb.  Being that this cannot be statically linked in to the ios app and is sent as a deployed framework, there is no last mile optimization linking to shrink the total app package down.\r\n\r\nIs there a recommended way to reduce the size?  Thanks!\r\n\r\n",
