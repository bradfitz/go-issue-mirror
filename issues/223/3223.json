	"body": "\u003cpre\u003ePer discussions / confusion with Heroku folk, it's obvious that the sql package's docs\nare lacking.\n\nDocument that there is no \u0026quot;session context\u0026quot; in the sql package.  Or rather,\nthat the *DB is the session context, but once the session context (the *DB) is used by\nmultiple goroutines, then session context is shared.  We currently say \u0026quot;It's safe\nfor concurrent use by multiple goroutines.\u0026quot;, which is true, and is the common case,\nbut that should elaborate more about what exactly tha means.\n\nAnd document that a *Tx is a \u0026quot;session\u0026quot;. (~bound to a conn==session), and once\nthe Tx is Committed or rolled back, the session is lost.  (session being SQL local\nvariables and such)\n\nIf you want multiple concurrent long-lived multi-Tx \u0026quot;sessions\u0026quot;, each client\nshould do its own sql.Open and not share its *DB with others.\u003c/pre\u003e",
