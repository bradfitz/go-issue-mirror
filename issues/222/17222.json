	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo1.7.1\r\n\r\nCurrently, in order to figure out whether a `go/ast.CallExpr` refers to a variadic function call, the only option is to check whether the `Ellipsis` field refers to a valid position. In fact, searching for `Ellipsis.IsValid` reveals [10 locations in the standard library](https://golang.org/search?q=Ellipsis.IsValid) in which this approach is taken to checking whether a function call is variadic. This is a tad verbose, but worse, its meaning is non-obvious to someone not intimately familiar with the `go/ast` package.\r\n\r\nInstead, I propose that it would be nice if there were a convenience method on `CallExpr`, `IsVariadic`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc (x *CallExpr) IsVariadic() bool {\r\n    return x.Ellipsis.IsValid()\r\n}\r\n```",
