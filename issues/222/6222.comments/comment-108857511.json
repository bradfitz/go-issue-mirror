	"body": "Here is a nice implementation of Poller:\r\nhttps://github.com/npat-efault/poller\r\n\r\nIt gives safe Close() in one goroutine while read/write operations are blocked in other goroutines and all read/write operations are released after close().\r\nIt also gives useful methods like  SetDeadline, SetReadDeadline, SetWriteDeadline.\r\n\r\nThis package only implements linux epoll syscall. I think it could use golang runtime poller to make it multi platform.\r\n\r\nThanks.  ",
