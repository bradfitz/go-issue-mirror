	"body": "@ianlancetaylor, the problem with the new context support in os/exec is that it doesn't do anything if you only use Start instead of Start+Wait or Run. And as @glasser pointed out, when reading the output of a program via a pipe, you only call Start \u0026 do blocking reads and only call Wait later. All that time, your context finishing does nothing.\r\n\r\nI think Start needs to start a goroutine monitoring the context and killing the process if needed.",
