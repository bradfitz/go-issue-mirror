	"body": "\u003cpre\u003ePresently, the runtime blocks an operating system thread when performing a file system\noperation such as a file read or write.  However, the same interfaces used by the poller\nto poll socket file descriptors can be used for file system file descriptors.\n\nIn addition to limiting the number of threads in the runtime, there are other potential\nresource usage and running time benefits.  An experiement should be conducted across the\nvarious supported platforms to understand whether there is an opportunity for a\nperformance improvement.  The answer might depend on the quality of the underlying\nasynchronous I/O implementation and its interaction with the kernel event notification\nsystem.\u003c/pre\u003e",
