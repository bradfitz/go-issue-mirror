	"body": "I just discovered the tool *gorebuild* which extracts import paths from the binary. However it seems to derive it from a filesystem path since it's printing absolute paths for me. The independent existence of that tool is another reason why storing this would be useful and necessary.\r\n\r\nMaybe instead of a manifest file this information **should in fact be embedded in the binary itself**? That would have the additional benefit of carrying to another system than where the binary was built. If already filesystem paths are stored, import path should be even less sensitive to add. Not sure if there exists a cross-platform place to embed such meta-information into binary and retrieve it.",
