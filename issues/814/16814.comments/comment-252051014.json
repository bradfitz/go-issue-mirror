	"body": "This issue is asking for a particular implementation, not new functionality. Like @shurcooL said, this needs to be in service of a concrete larger goal in order to be evaluated. I'm not opposed to putting the import path into the binary next to the build ID, as long as there's some limit to how long it is (build IDs are designed to be limited size). We certainly don't want to try to record the specific version of every file.\r\n\r\nNone of this is necessary for proper build caching. The build IDs in the binary today already suffice.\r\n\r\nIn any event, this is vague enough that we can put any decisions off to the Go 1.9 cycle.\r\n",
