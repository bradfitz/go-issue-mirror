And by looking at\r\nthe file that contains main.main, you can know the path of the main package.\r\n\r\nThat's what gorebuild (and [`importpathof`](https://github.com/shurcooL/play/blob/master/200/cmd/importpathof/main.go#L82)) already do.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't work reliably if the GOPATH is not set (or is different) when trying to reconstruct the import path.\r\n\r\nImagine if main.main is located at path `/home/user/src/foo/src/bar/main.go`. Without knowing the GOPATH used to when building the original import path, it's impossible to know if the import path of the binary was `foo/src/bar` or `bar`. This is a contrived example of the possible ambiguity.",
