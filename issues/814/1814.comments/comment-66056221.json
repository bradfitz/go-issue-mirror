This will be harder to detect and\nhas no practical value. Such self-recursive interface types should not be allowed as per\ncurrent compiler implementation.\n\n\nChanging this to a documentation issue: The spec should probably clarify what forms of\ndirect and indirect recursions are legal in type declarations.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **documentation**, removed **compilerbug**, **languagechange**._",
