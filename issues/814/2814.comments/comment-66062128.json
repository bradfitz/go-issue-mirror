Just like they won't convert the string \"257\" into a uint8, we\nshouldn't collapse \"\" and NULL together.  Also, if we did it for strings, people would\nwant it for ints too, and NULL vs 0 seems potentially more serious than NULL vs \"\".\n\nI'd rather see people modify their SQL to collapse them there explicitly if they want,\nor write NullString explicitly if they want to get one out.  I think that being explicit\nabout types feels more Go-like.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
