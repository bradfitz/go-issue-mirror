	"body": "**Edit: After more thought and discussion embedding the import path in binary seems like the way to go. This would enable upgrading an installed binary application in many cases.**\r\n\r\nOriginal submission below:\r\n\r\nI'd like to have go get and go install produce a manifest along with the binary that indicates when the binary was compiled, what package produced it.\r\n\r\nThis is useful to understand why I have binaries in my bin/ and would allow e.g. updating them in bulk later through some mechanism (TBD outside of this issue).\r\n\r\nWhy this should be enabled by default? Many existing tools (e.g. editors) have a mechanism to install tools (e.g. go guru). To have a complete manifest, including already shipping editors and external applications, this should be updated by default (if someone insists, with opt-out flag).\r\n\r\nPlease answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n        $ go version\r\n        go version go1.7 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\n    Uh, isn't this redundant to 1.?\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\n        $Â go get golang.org/x/review/git-codereview\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n    A manifest file listing where the binary came from being generated along with the binary\r\n\r\n    E.g.\r\n\r\n        2016-08-21T07:33:00Z package golang.org/x/review/git-codereview SHA256:619b8b31e9aed60e19051d403e01214847124370752bae131a0d96c022830e25\r\n\r\n    This could be a simple text file in $GOPATH/bin/.manifest or something more fancy. KISS would support a simple log format. The exact fields open to discussion, but I feel that timestamp, package and hash of the binary generated are minimal; possibly VCS version could be nice.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n    No manifest file generated.\r\n",
