If instead some core `go generate`-ers were distributed [as part of a release](https://golang.org/dl/) then:\r\n\r\n* no further `go get` is required to do core things (like slice sorting)\r\n* we encourage people towards `go generate`\r\n* we avoid any reflection (per @cznic)\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nThere are of course some downsides here:\r\n\r\n* how to name these core-generators (to be relatively sure of avoiding `PATH` clashes with existing executable programs, we might need rather verbose names like `goGenSort`)\r\n* another step in the process of learning Go\r\n* ...",
