Not as simple to use as the proposed sort.Slice, but simpler and not limited to slices. If that's the only box you want checked, it checks that box. \r\n\r\nLanguage changes should get their own issues. I remember it being discussed a long time ago, at least on the mailing list, but couldn't find anything with a cursory search. At any rate that would be Go2 territory.",
