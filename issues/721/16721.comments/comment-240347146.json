I'm not sure I understand the problem you're explaining.\r\n\r\n@minux - I agree, but I think having a `*T` argument is better - it involves as little copying as an index, and is much cleaner and means that the comparison function doesn't have to be aware of the data ahead of time.\r\n\r\n@anacrolix - Yep, although you'd need to verify that the types matched up first (e.g., that the first argument is a slice type, that the second is a function, that it takes two arguments, etc).
