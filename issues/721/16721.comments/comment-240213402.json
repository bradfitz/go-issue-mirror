I should update it and move it to go4.org. Still, I believe this is common enough to warrant being in the standard library and would improve the readability of code.\r\n\r\n@nsf, let's stay on topic. Nobody (except perhaps you) is proposing language changes. This bug  is about a library change proposal only. If you want to discuss a hypothetical language change, the best place is probably golang-nuts@, since it's out of scope for Go 1.",
