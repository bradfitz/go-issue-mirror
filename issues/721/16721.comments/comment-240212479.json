	"body": "I really like this idea. I'm also one of those that have almost never written anything different for 2 of the 3 sort interface methods for slices. And also have found it a bit embarrassing having to explain to new Go devs how much boilerplate has to be written to sort a slice. Usually they then ask why they can't just call a sort function with a single key function, like in other languages. \r\n\r\nI agree that because it's a localized addition to the sort package that only makes doing a thing more straightforward, that there is 100% benefit here. People can still use the existing approach or use the new shorter approach when it makes sense. Let's fix warts. ",
