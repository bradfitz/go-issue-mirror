I dislike the idea, because it can get out of hand quite quickly and I consider DSLs of this form a bad habit. They hide simple, readable code behind layers of abstractions that need to be unwound.\r\n\r\nAlso, it will, if used extensively, make code slower. While performance shouldn't be the ultimate goal, I think encouraging fast code by default is a good thing (and as I said, I believe it hurts readability too, though that's subjective).",
