	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eAdd operations on int/uint types to sync/atomic package.\n\nint is used as indices/len/cap by slices/maps/chans, widely used in\nstd lib interfaces and seems to be the \u0026quot;default\u0026quot; integer type\notherwise.\nCurrent atomic interface forces to use casts to work with int type.\nCasts are ugly.\nThere is another unpleasant implication -- the casts make code less\nportable because force you to say explicitly how many bits you expect\nint is.\nIf int64 is used instead of int for the sake of atomic operations, it incurs performance\npenalty on 32-bit platforms, and raises alignment issues.\u003c/pre\u003e",
