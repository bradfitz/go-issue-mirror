Here's a java snippet (of the critical code) from an installer I wrote years ago, which reads large zip files, and displays images from near the start of the archive while the rest of it downloads.\r\n\r\nURLConnection connection = new URL(updateZipURL).openConnection();\r\nBufferedInputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(new MyStream(connection.getInputStream()));\r\nzipStream = new ZipInputStream(in);\r\nZipEntry entry;\r\nwhile ((entry = zipStream.getNextEntry()) != null) {\r\n    // If image, add to display queue, otherwise unpack to file.\r\n}\r\n\r\nAPI for ZipInputStream here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/zip/ZipInputStream.html\r\n\r\nTo answer your first question, I want to port the installer to go.  I also have another project that would benefit from this library.\r\n",
