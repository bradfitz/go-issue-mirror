	"body": "\u003cpre\u003ePoking through gc-produced binaries, there are a fair number of small symbols that\nrepresent the same data, particularly among gclocals.* and gcargs.*. Using dupok\ncontent-addressable symbols (like ARM does for floats and doubles, e.g. $f32.00000000)\nwould allow many of these symbols to be gracefully collapsed, resulting in a smaller\nbinary.\n\nIt might even be worth having a general content-addressable symbol shared across all\nread-only users of small symbols.\n\nThis might want to be controlled by a compiler flag, so that it is easy to separate back\nout the symbols as needed for debugging the liveness analysis, etc.\u003c/pre\u003e",
