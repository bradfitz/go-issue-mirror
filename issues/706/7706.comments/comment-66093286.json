Ideally such tests would be protected by a\nbuild tag, but it is inconvenient to break them out just for the sake of one\npeculiar property of a host operating system. Also, it's important to remember\nto revisit such tests from time to time and make sure they really do need to be\nskipped.\n\nThis CL suggests a third category: correctness under the race detector. (If it's\njust a matter of slowness, there's testing.Short for that.) All tests should\npass under the race detector, unless the race detector has a bug, in which case\nthat should be fixed. Here the idea of skipping a test for correctness issues\nfeels very wrong, since tests will pass but the code is incorrect - it has a\nrace! Therefore it seems very unwise to encourage people to skip tests that\nshould succeed, and the addition of a special function to do this is\ncounterproductive.\n\nFor those rare cases where, for whatever reason, it is necessary, custom\nsolutions are easy enough to implement. But making it feel normal to deny the\nrace detector a chance to verify a test is working goes against the very idea of\nthe facility.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
