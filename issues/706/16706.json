	"body": "Go 1.7 already shrank the Go binaries a lot, I think we can do\r\neven better with judiciously used binary compression.\r\n\r\n#11799 mentions compressed debug info, and #6993 talks\r\nabout compression of static init data. This proposal wants to\r\ngo further to do compression on data and code.\r\n\r\nWith the help from compiler, we can do much better than\r\nstandard binary compressor could do (e.g. upx). For example,\r\nwe can compress the typeinfo that only used by reflect, and\r\ndecompress then when used.\r\n\r\nSome of the targets limit self-modifying code (iOS), so obviously\r\nthe code compression must be enabled on a target by target\r\nbasis.",
