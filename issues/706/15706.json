What did you do?\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo test -c runtime/pprof\r\nGOMAXPROCS=1 GOGC=1 GODEBUG=gcstackbarrierall=1 GOTRACEBACK=crash ./pprof.test -test.v -test.short -test.run=TestStackBarrierProfiling -test.timeout=1m\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nThe test should finish in under a second.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nThe test runs until you kill it.\r\n\r\nThe test is actively running and spinning around the main test loop, but the time.After that's supposed to fire after 0.2 seconds and stop the test never fires. Digging into the runtime state, it looks like timeproc was started, but never actually gets scheduled (timers.created is true, but timers.gp is 0), so the timer never fires. Most likely it's being starved by something. Possibly the test is tricking the scheduler into switching the one available P back and forth between the test goroutine and the GC mark worker and never getting to the rest of the run queue. The scheduler state is below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(gdb) print-sched \r\nG state:\r\n       1 waiting (chan receive)\r\n         started at runtime.main\r\n         created by runtime.rt0_go\r\n       2 waiting (force gc (idle))\r\n         started at runtime.forcegchelper\r\n         created by runtime.init.4\r\n       3 runnable\r\n         started at runtime.bgsweep\r\n         created by runtime.gcenable\r\n       4 running, m 0, p 0, fractional mark worker\r\n         started at runtime.gcBgMarkWorker\r\n         created by runtime.gcBgMarkStartWorkers\r\n       5 runnable\r\n         started at runtime.runfinq\r\n         created by runtime.createfing\r\n       6 runnable\r\n         started at runtime.timerproc\r\n         created by runtime.addtimerLocked\r\n       7 scanwaiting (GC assist wait)\r\n         started at testing.tRunner\r\n         created by testing.(*T).Run\r\n       8 runnable\r\n         started at runtime/pprof.profileWriter\r\n         created by runtime/pprof.StartCPUProfile\r\n\r\nM state:\r\n       0 PID 12395, g 4, p 0, 2 locks\r\n       1 PID 12399\r\n       2 PID 12400, blocked\r\n\r\nP state:\r\n       0 running, g 4, m 0, mark worker g 4\r\n         runq: 5 6 8\r\n\r\nglobal runq: 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n/cc @RLH @dvyukov ",
