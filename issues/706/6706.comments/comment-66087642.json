T{}.m is not a clear syntactic reference, since determining\nwhich method is involved requires doing type checking to determine that the type of T{}\nis T, which is not an interface type, and therefore the method is known.  The spec is\ntrying to say that initialization loops are detected purely syntactically, so finding a\nloop should not require type checking.\n\nThat argument seems plausible to me, so I am closing this bug.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
