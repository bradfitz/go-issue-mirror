I think\ndisabling inline might actually make the binary larger (the caller have to\nspill all registers before the call). We just need to reduce the threshold\nfor inlining in the small mode.\n\nI agree that we might not need to support code compression because upx is\nalready doing a good job on that. We just need to get rid of unnecessary\nthings in the binary. But I expect different people has different ideas on\nwhat is unnecessary (sometimes I really want to get rid of symbolic\nbacktrace, but other times, I don't.)\n",
