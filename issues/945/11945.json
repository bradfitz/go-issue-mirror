The spec is not explicit about this, but this behavior violates the invariant\r\n```\r\nz == complex(real(z), imag(z))\r\n```\r\nfor untyped constants z because real and imag won't work if the complex arguments have untyped constant components outside the float64 domain (see also #11540 ).\r\n\r\nBoth gc, and go/types accept this code. Both gc and go/types produce an untyped floating-point constant for untyped constant arguments.\r\n",
