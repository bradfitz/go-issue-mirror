	"body": "by **jeremy.f.stephens**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThis isn't a bug per se, but it's a bit confusing for someone learning Go (like myself).\n\nIn the Go tutorial, the sort package is introduced and the sort.IntArray type is\nmentioned. But this type isn't an int array, it's an int slice. I found the concepts of\nslices to be a bit confusing at first, and this aggravated my confusion somewhat.\n\nSimilarly, the tutorial creates a type dayArray, which is a struct that contains a slice\nof pointers.\n\nIs there any interest in renaming these types to IntSlice and daySlice? I think it would\nhelp. Or, it would be helpful if the tutorial explicitly said, \u0026quot;sort.IntArray is\nactually a slice\u0026quot;.\n\nThanks!\u003c/pre\u003e",
