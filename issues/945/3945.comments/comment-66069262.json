Unfortunately I do not have any new/better ideas about your\nproblem. \n\nPlease, do not use \"go run ...\", but just run your built program directly.\n\nI was expecting that using \"tip\" Go version will produce nice stack trace when you run\nyour program, but you say that it still produces \"phone home for a solution\" dialogue.\nOr well. Perhaps, you can run your program under gdb and get stack trace this way.\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/gdb\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/gdb\u003c/a\u003e could be helpful.\n\nWhat you see looks similar to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/3404\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/3404\u003c/a\u003e, but the\nreason for failure is, obviously, very different.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
