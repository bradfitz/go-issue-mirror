(If\nyou took that route, your packages import paths should be of the form \"chromium/net\",\netc. to avoid conflicts, but I understand you may want to keep all the net code and all\nthe tools together).\n\nAnother option would be to use symlinks, once the relevant issue is solved. Then, if\nyour tree structure is something like:\n\n  chromium/\n    net/\n      gonetpkg\n    tools/\n      gotool1\n\nand you run:\n\n  ln -s chromium $GOPATH/chromium\n\nyou could import gonetpkg from gotool1 as \"chromium/net/gonetpkg\".\n\nThe general solution I proposed in comment 5 would work too. You'd just need to use -l\nchromium/..\u003c/pre\u003e",
