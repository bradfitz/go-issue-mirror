(This is all kinda hypothetical as I've just been\ntrying to evaluate whether Go will work for me for various projects.)\n\nHowever, continuing the hypothetical, it does seem plausible to me that we'd eventually\nwrite some bits of shared Go code.  To make the example concrete, say we have tools that\nscrape our buildbot outputs and generate various reports; maybe we'd have some sort of\n\"buildbot log parser\" module that would be shared by various programs that would all\nlive in the Chrome tree under tools/ somewhere.\n\nIf refactoring out shared code meant that that we'd need to switch to a tree layout\nmatching the expected Go layout, then there's little point in special-casing just the\ntop-level package.\n\n(I'm not sure how \"project comprised of multiple modules\" is intended to be addressed in\nGo, even without the problem this bug was created about: like if my project internally\nhas a \"scraper\" module but that isn't useful for top-level module namespace, so it\ndoesn't make any sense to \"install\" such a module.  Sorry for all the confusion in my\nreport, I just really don't get how it's all intended to work.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
