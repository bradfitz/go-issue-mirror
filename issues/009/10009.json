	"body": "io.Reader make by  bytes.NewBuffer() is inefficiency in io.Copy() (in my test the server's QPS is 3000), but io.Reader come from http req.body(it is a io.Reader object) is efficient in io.Copy() (the server's QPS is 8000). in my test the []byte convert to io.Reader object, then copy to a io.Writer object.when i test this io.Writer like this: \r\nw.Write(payload[:])\r\nthe w is a io.Writer object, the efficiency is same with the io.Reader make by  bytes.NewBuffer().\r\nwho can tell me how to deal this?",
