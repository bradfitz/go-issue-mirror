When selecting the name for this programming language,\nwouldn't one think \nthat due diligence would include:\n\n1) a simple Bing search for existing languages of the same name\n2) a search of academic literature for programming languages of the same name\n\nSo someone screwed up...  This happens.  It's time for the Google team to find a new\nname, apologize, and at \nleast give the perception that they do no evil.\u003c/pre\u003e",
