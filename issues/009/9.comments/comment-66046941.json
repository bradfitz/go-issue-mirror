It's not illegal. There's a reason people are upset on Mr. McCabe's\nbehalf, though, and it's because a social convention has been broken.\n\nThere's no law against being rude, but people will still form an impression of you\nbased on your behavior.\n\n(Personally, I like \"\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/9\"\u003eissue #9\u003c/a\u003e\"/i9 as a name. It's clever, searchable, gives a nod to\nthe Plan 9 roots, and wraps this issue up almost perfectly. But I expect that those\nwithin Google won't budge on this, because substantial effort has already been put\ninto branding.)\n\nFinal request: will someone actually working on the project comment here, and either\nclose the issue as WontFix, or move it to Thinking?\u003c/pre\u003e",
