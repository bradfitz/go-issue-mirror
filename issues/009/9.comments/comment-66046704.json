Mr. McCabe has today gained more publicity for his \nniche-size programming language than he's ever had before. Good enough.\n\nIf he really wants to promote his language, he should put up more than a single \nwebpage on it. I mean seriously, I can't even find a single code sample from 'Go!'.\n\nGiven this, I cannot really consider 'Go!' to be a serious programming language -- \nthat is, a language than anybody in their right mind would use for a real \n(professional) project. Even if the language itself is high quality, there's next to \nnothing in the way of docs, tutorials, reference programs written in it, etc.\n\nBuck up, Mr. McCabe.\u003c/pre\u003e",
