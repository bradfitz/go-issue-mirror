Copyright doesn't apply in cases\nwhere the IP was reached independently.  So if Google didn't know about Go! (I assume\nthey didn't) then the original use isn't protected under copyright law.  I assume\nthat Go! it isn't a registered trademark of Mr. McCabe, so really Google has no legal\nobligation to change the name of the language.\n\nSecond: Is Google morally obligated to change the name of their new language?  Not\nreally.  There are things with similar names all over the place, its not a problem. \nGoogle isn't trying to rip anyone off here.\n\nSecond: Should Google change the name of the language in my opinion? Yes!  Go is a\ncrappy name.  I like \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/9\"\u003eissue #9\u003c/a\u003e, i9, or some other non-dictionary word.\u003c/pre\u003e",
