What can be better than let \nusers choose the name of this language? I'm personally very surprised by this \nlanguage and I already started to use this for my next (small) project = a PDF \nreader. I've checked twice if there is everything I need and I found what I need \nwith a nice syntax. Maybe the PNG-predictors (reading and writing) would be \nsomething interesting, but well, I can program this by myself. So, why this hurts \nthe developers of this language if I think it should be renamed (for reasons that \nyou can read in this issue)? Opponents of \"\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/9\"\u003eissue #9\u003c/a\u003e\" or Go (without exclamation mark) \nwill always refer back to issue no. 9. Since \"\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/9\"\u003eissue #9\u003c/a\u003e\" is no bad name, I think it's \nbetter to rename it as far as possible. This gives a next time for the press to \nwrite something about it and even the author of Go! will benefit from it - even in \nfuture, since this story will be something like a myth, a nice story, everybody \nwants to read or hear about. Google can only win if they rename this nice thing.\u003c/pre\u003e",
