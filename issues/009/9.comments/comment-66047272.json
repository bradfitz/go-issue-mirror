Google can use “Go” word as a name of the programming language, which \nis damn true. Now it depends on them, if they try to be holy soul and change the \nname or simply ignore Mr. Fab. Try to understand that in any case people will get \nbenefit out of this “Google Go” programming language.\u003c/pre\u003e",
