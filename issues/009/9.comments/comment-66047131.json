As many people have pointed out,\ncommon words like \"go\" are not easily searchable (and I don't just mean in Internet\nsearch engines but everywhere).  It wasn't a helpful choice.\n\nSince Google is clearly in the wrong on the name clash issue anyway (and derelict in\nnot checking first), they should demonstrate now that they're a nice friendly\ncommunity player, not an evil one, and take the opportunity to rename the language\nwith a more useful name.\u003c/pre\u003e",
