Let's begin calling them *n*x* or even better, specify: Linux,\nSolaris, freeBSD, go ahead!\n\n\u003eNice, google, this thread is a great\n\u003eillustration of the \"Don't be evil\" motto.\n\u003e\n\nWhy does every google-related have to bring a \"don't be evil\" skeptic to say \"I told\nU SO!\"?  Honestly, that's old. Very old, get a new thing to talk about. BTW, I don't\nsee any post from a google representative in here.\n\nhmnn. I do hope fmccabe wins. If \"Go!\" can beat \"Go\" in a lawsuit so will \"Bjarne\nStroustrup\" be able to sue MS and get them to rename C# to \"Gibbberish\" and thus they\nwill stop leeching on the C name!. Then the C guys will sue \"Bjarne Stroustrup\" and\nalso bring a lot of positive news for everyone.\u003c/pre\u003e",
