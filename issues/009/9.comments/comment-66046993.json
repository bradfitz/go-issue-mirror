But not wrong.\n\nPeople are talking about copyright issues, but while copyright is implicit it does\nnot cover titles or names, which are solely the domain of trademark law.\nAs such, if there was any legal ground it would have to be on trademark issues, but\nas there _is_ no trademark (and I doubt any IP office would allow a trademark for\nsomething so simple), there is no possibility of successful litigation from either\nside, even if one party was to file for and be granted a trademark at this stage.\n\nAnyone predicting lawsuits needs to find a better spirit guide.  Much better\narguments are presented in this issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
