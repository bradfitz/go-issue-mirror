And I'm 8 minutes too late to get comment #512! :(\n\nSeriously - forget about it.\nGoogle had probably never heard about your lanugage before, or they just didn't care\nbecause they found soo meny other names that already were taken so that they just\npicked one they liked and hoped that there wouldn't be any chaos.\n\nAnd I agree with everybody that has commented about the namespace bing filled up too\nquickly if everybody just could pick a name and claim copyright of it (that's not how\nthe law works anyway), so that newcomers in 20 years from now would have to pick\nsomething like GoGoGNow5003 to not violate a vunch of laws (or they would just\nviolate the \"Go\" copyright three times and the \"Now\" copyright once all at the same\ntime instead.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
