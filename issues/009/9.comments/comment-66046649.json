Now you're trying to draw attention, but \nstill no one is using Go! nor buying your book. Do you want to know a simple reason? \nYour language doesn't even have a website. The one-paragraph page that exists is hard \nto find.\n\nYou shouldn't be grateful for advertising because it doesn't help you. You should be \nashamed that you start such topic. It all could have sense and you could keep honor \nif your language was alive and have real community.\n\nAnd your \u003c\u003e operator sucks. Objectively.\u003c/pre\u003e",
