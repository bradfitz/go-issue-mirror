This is to be considered.\n\nI recognize that you Mr. McCabe were there first with your programing language's\nname, but by now it might just be a matter of considering if the cons of this\nsituation arising are outweighing the pros, because this situation sure has good\nconsequences such as increasing your language's attention - would I ever had to get\nto know your language some day without this happening? Probably not.\n\nIf possible, you should try to get the best out of this situation which you had no\ncontrol on to start with and try to make it work to your advantage, but if\nunsatisfied then you should seek legal advice.\n\nI still disagree with Google's choice to name its language \"Go\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
