I see you have a book on it, very nice. A trademark though would likely settle\nthis matter in your favor especially if you decided to ask The Google for a bit of\ntheir GOld that shines on GOogle for your letting them use Go as a name for their\nlanguage. Just a thought.\n\nI really like Golang by the way Go(oogle) team since Go(ogle) seems to be very\nsimilar and in the same category of languages as Erlang in the sense of servers and\nclients communicating via pipes aka channels in Go(ogle) much like what happens in\nErlang. Both are characterized by coarse grained concurrency in the servers, although\nin your examples you did show a very simple fine grained 100,000 unit spawn of\nGo(ogle)routines flocking in a serial flow of chain linked servers. Nice.\u003c/pre\u003e",
