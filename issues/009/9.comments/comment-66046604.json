I have a\nsuggestion...\n\ncgo  C + go; Computer Generated Observation; Computer Generated Oblivion or Computer\nGenerated Objects, or my favorite Computer Generated orthogonal; From Wikipedia \"An\ninstruction set is said to be orthogonal if any instruction can use any register in\nany addressing mode.\"\n\nIt doesn't hurt that cgo is an acronym for Cargo; considering all the discussion with\ntype, pretty much means that it can contain anything for flexibility...\n\nAs for \"Go\"; The Chinese have been playing Go for thousands of years (from Wikipedia\n~ \"Go originated in ancient China more than 2,500 years ago\").  Easier to learn than\nchess; yet strategies that can take a lifetime to master.  So the Original guy and\nGoogle BOTH should change the names of their languages.  Obviously Google's Go is\nlast to the party.\n\nIn the long run I believe they (Google) will do the right thing!\u003c/pre\u003e",
