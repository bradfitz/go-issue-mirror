Someone once used an English word to refer \nto an obscure project no one has ever heard of and is hard to find references to, on \nwhich there is no trademark, that is of no commercial value, and has no audience or \ncommunity to get confused by the name clash anyway?\n\nBut hey, all the stupid people on this thread can blather on about prior art and \ncopyright and fairness until the cows come home. I'm sure they'll even express their \nanger at Google's satanic ways by boycotting their services! Or, not.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/9\"\u003eissue #9\u003c/a\u003e would be a cool name for what its worth. No doubt someone will invent such a \nlanguage, if only in the form of a Go parody.\u003c/pre\u003e",
