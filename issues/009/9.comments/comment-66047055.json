Won't need to\nchange any of the internals to rename stuff. Can still call goroutines, goroutines, etc.\n\nBut look, the lack of any response from google or the language designers/implementers\ntell me that they are actually taking this seriously, they're just thinking about\nwhat to do.\n\nLet them come up with their own name, if they decide to change it. One of the perks\nof writing your own language is that you get to name it. They must have liked \"go\",\nso it's probably hard for them to walk away from it.\n\nThis has nothing to do with google. They're just the originators of the language.\nThey're not trying to be evil, or whatever. They just developed something cool,\ndidn't see the name taken on Wikipedia (the Go! entry was only added after this issue\nwas raised) and went with Go. Cut them some slack, people.\u003c/pre\u003e",
