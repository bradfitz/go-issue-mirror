Or maybe they could, just to poke Y!\nto check if there's still life in the rival ;-) Yahoo! had a product for mobile\nphones called Go, BTW. It's now turned into a longish sentence.\n\nI'd vote for go2 as well. It's the new go, the new goto and it doesn't take away the\n\"go func()\" syntax for goroutines.\u003c/pre\u003e",
