Also you have to look at it from fmccabe point\nof view working on a language for that long and in comes big corp don't care my\nlanguage will be named this no matter what. Bunch of tools. \nHow about changing it to FAD, because after the marketing hype dies down that's all\nthe language will be.\u003c/pre\u003e",
