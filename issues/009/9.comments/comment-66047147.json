I realize that it is human nature to\nrepeat the same task over and over and over again, and open source facilitates people\ndoing the same exact thing over and over and over again, but is it  *really*\nnecessary for all of SIX BILLION people to say the same exact thing? Wouldn't it be\nfar more effective and a lot easier to manage if people instead simply voted that\nthey all shared the same opinion?\n\nPlease people, follow the advice of the notice and simply upvote the issue if you\ndon't have anything more to contribute.\u003c/pre\u003e",
