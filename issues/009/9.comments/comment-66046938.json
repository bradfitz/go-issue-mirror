As a \"verb\" that \"go\" means something like to move from point A to B in a \nspecific way. Nice. But is a compiling language something that \"moves\"? Well there \nis a construct in Issue9 that starts with the keyword \"go\". But that alone is no \nreason to name this language. It's a very nice thing, well. It's not not that \nimportant to acceptance like to be honest. And - we want to be \"experimental\" with \nthis language: why not change the now official name.\n\nPS: \"Issue9\" is acceptable as new name as \"\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/9\"\u003eissue #9\u003c/a\u003e\". I'd personally think that \nbetween \"Issue\" and \"9\" needs to be a half-space sized space... ;)\u003c/pre\u003e",
