Don't you recognize that titles are often \nrecycled.  There are often dozens of books with the same title, and if you look in \nthe IMDB you will see that movie names are frequently recycled for completly \nunrelated films or TV shows.\n\nThe law provides a mechanism if you want to protect a name.  It's called trademark.  \nYou chose not to do that with your language.  You could have, but in effect by not \ntrademarking it you were saying that you didn't mind if someone else also used the \nname for a computer language.\n\nNow, after the fact, you've changed you mind, and do want the title to apply to your \nlanguage only.  Unfortunately, you can't begin to see it this way.\u003c/pre\u003e",
