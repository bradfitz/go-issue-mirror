I have used many tools and \nlanguages in that time - many of which are now dead. It is not an issue of not liking \nthe name - it is an issue of choosing not to support something I believe is immoral. \nI can believe that Google didn't realize the name was already used, and the proper \nway to deal with that situation is to change it. \"Not being evil\" requires action - \nit is not something you can simply say. They need to change the name. There's \nhundreds of programming languages to choose from, and \"Google GO\" is actually nothing \nspecial - in fact, it has re-introduced some issues which I find particularly \nannoying, and dropped features which many developers like.\u003c/pre\u003e",
