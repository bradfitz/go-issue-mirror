Just keep the name and let google\nresolve the issue in your behalf.  You will get free hits and free advertisement.  \nIn fact, if you plan to promote this language or do anything else with it,  now would\nbe an excellent opportunity to expand on it in an aggressive way.  \n\nI do not see this as a problem that you will have to worry about or try to solve. \nKeep in mind that if you really want to distinguish your language from others\nincluding Google's,   they will want this even more since this is a business for them\nand they will probably be reasonable about it if you are.\u003c/pre\u003e",
