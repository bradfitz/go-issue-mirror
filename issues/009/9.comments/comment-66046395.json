Namesquatting on other languages is just poor\nmanners and arrogance. \nSaying that it's ok because Microsoft does it hardly improves the strength of Google's\ncase. \n\nHmmm. It makes one reconsider basing what one is doing around Google's products doesn't\nit? This is a \ncompany that is becoming increasingly badly behaved. One day you have collusion with the\nChinese government \nand gratuitous namesquatting on other languages, the next day... what? will it be\npassing along the position of \npeople using the Android navigation system to the Government without subpoena? Something\nmore nefarious?\u003c/pre\u003e",
