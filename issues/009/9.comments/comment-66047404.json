Besides, \"goog\" is \nalready the name of Google's Closure package.\n\nAnyway, it's the name of the programming language, it's not a company or organization \nor a legal entity. Is it a crime to use the same name? 'Go' and write your own \nprogramming language and name it 'go', so what?\u003c/pre\u003e",
