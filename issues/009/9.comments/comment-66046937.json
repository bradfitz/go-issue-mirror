Have you \nspent 10 years working on something? I understand that his work might have not had the\nimpact that other \nlanguages had, but as conscientious human one might try not to deliberately stomp on\nother people and their \nwork. Especially if it's as simple as naming something.\n\nBtw. the name makes it impossible to search. So they could use this as a good excuse to\nchange the name \ninto something better. However, I doubt they will do it, because it would require\nadmitting a mistake (didn't \ngoogle for \"go language\") and by now they're also already emotionally attached to the\nname.\u003c/pre\u003e",
