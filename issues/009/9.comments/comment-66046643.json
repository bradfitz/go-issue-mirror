It seems to have hit\na nerve.\n\nI want to make one particular point, some people have suggested that \"I should be\ngrateful\" for the extra \nadvertising. My response to that is that I was not actively looking for this\nadvertising. It was not me who \npicked a clashing name.\n\nI fully understand that it is possible that insufficient search was done before hand.\nHowever, when I picked \nthe name Go! I did try to find out if anyone else was using it. In fact, I was kind of\nsurprised that no one \nwas!; since it was clearly a great name.\n\nFor those interested, Go! is a bi-lingual pun. My previous work focused on a language\ncalled April. In \nJapanese, the literal back-translation of April is \"4th Month\". Go is Japanese for 5.\u003c/pre\u003e",
