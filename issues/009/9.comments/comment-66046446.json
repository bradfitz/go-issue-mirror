Their team had a very talented designer, so we\nmade an arrangement that their team would contribute artwork to my team, and in\nexchange, I changed the name of my project to Buzzbird.\n\nPerhaps Google could make a similar arrangement with fmccabe?  Is there some\ncompensation or contribution that Google could make to Go! in exchange for him\nchanging the name of his language?\u003c/pre\u003e",
