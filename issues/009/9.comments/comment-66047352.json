If he did, then Google will have to change its name. If he did not,\nthen it is up to the discretion of Google whether to change the name. However, it\nwould be pretty uncool for Google to reuse a name of a language like that. Nobody\nreally cares about the name of a language, but programmers do care that a language is\nuseful. You could name your language anything ... I mean look at Java (a cup of\ncoffee?) Come on! You could name your language Plate or Wheel ... who cares? Google\nshould change the name regardless and change the title for the tutorial page because\nit's the same thing as McCabe's book. Google you are better than this ... simply\nadmit your mistake and change the name. It will catch on no matter what.\u003c/pre\u003e",
