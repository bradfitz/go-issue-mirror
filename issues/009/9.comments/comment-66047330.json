As someone pointed out earlier, go is open source, so *when*\nsomeone (or some group) makes a go clone with the name \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/9\"\u003eissue #9\u003c/a\u003e, will people use that\nor go? Remember, this language is still only a few days old, people have no\nattachment to it yet.\n\nLooking at the votes, it would be reasonable in some manner to assume people would go\nwith the clone.\n\nIn fact, a clone would wipe out many of the cons that this project faces with\nrenaming, and retain all the pros. And all those features that have been rejected\ncould be added.\n\nIt will sure be interesting to see how the community reacts, whatever path is chosen\non Google's side.\u003c/pre\u003e",
