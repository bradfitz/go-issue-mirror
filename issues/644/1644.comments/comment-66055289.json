See\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/tSDpLubyVDo/7fBbYVE4IxsJ\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/tSDpLubyVDo/7fBbYVE4IxsJ\u003c/a\u003e for details.\n\nThe real hard-limit on number of threads on OS X is 2560, which is big enough for all\npractical reasons.\n\nOf course non-blocking time.Sleep would be awesome. :)\u003c/pre\u003e",
