I'll push that fix shortly and it should appear in Go 1.7.1 (which we already have a few bugs for, so I suspect that won't be too far off).\r\n\r\n@scosman, it sounds like you have a different bug, then. The crash in \"notok\" just means *some* system call failed, which could have any number of causes. Could you open a new bug and CC me, @minux, and @crawshaw? Please include any additional information you have. Unfortunately, the one stack frame isn't enough to figure much out. More frames would be great. Even just a dump of the registers would be helpful.",
