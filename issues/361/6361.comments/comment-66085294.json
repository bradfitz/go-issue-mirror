It checks if Origin header\nis valid URL by default. ...  if you want to accept non-browser client, which doesn't\nsend Origin header, you could use Server . that doesn't check origin in its Handshake.\"\n\nSo while I think the docs could be more up-front about this, it's not an error in the\ncode.\u003c/pre\u003e",
