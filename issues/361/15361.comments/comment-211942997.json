	"body": "I agree with @dvyukov that assists should be able to scan roots. I don't see why they shouldn't; the amount of fighting is bounded by the number of Ps whether it's assists doing it or the background mark worker. The difficulty is that we currently don't count root scanning as \"scan work\", so assists can't get credit for it (and can't satisfy their debt with it). This also means that the background worker won't build up global credit while it's scanning roots, which is probably contributing to the delay. Tracking the stats on that is somewhat subtle, which is why we don't do it right now, but it's definitely doable.\r\n\r\nI believe we'll also want this when we start re-scanning stacks during concurrent mark so that assists can help out with that.\r\n\r\n\u003e In the case where the root scan is not complete and there are no work bufs available we could just allow the goroutine to go ahead and allocate.\r\n\r\nWe used to do this and then I worked very hard to eliminate this uncontrolled allocation window because @dvyukov had some great benchmarks that used this window to completely blow out the heap goal.",
