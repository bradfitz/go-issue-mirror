	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eGo version: 1.2\n\nThe Overview section of the \u0026quot;testing\u0026quot; package docs could benefit from\nincluding this line:\n\n```You write a test by creating a file with a name ending in _test.go that contains\nfunctions named TestXXX with signature func (t *testing.T). The test framework runs each\nsuch function; if the function calls a failure function such as t.Error or t.Fail, the\ntest is considered to have failed.```\n\nThat would help beginners get their bearings. I eventually found that explanation here:\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Testing\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/code.html#Testing\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhile writing my first tests I was looking around for something like assertEqual et al,\nand that would have saved me a little time.\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
