Maybe it would work to send\nback more than just the one number from the child process.\nIf we sent back both what was going on and the error, that might be\nenough.  The problem is that the child sends back\n\n\u0026lt;error-from-chdir\u0026gt;\n\nand then the parent makes an error that says\n\nexec program: \u0026lt;error-from-chdir\u0026gt;\n\nwhich inevitably ends up saying something confusing like\n\nexec program: path does not exist\n\nwhich is bogus.  The current code checks the directory early\nso that it can return an error like\n\nchdir dir: path does not exist\n\ninstead.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
