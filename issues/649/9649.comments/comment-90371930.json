The issue seems to be that the error examined at https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/encoding/gob/decode.go#L1111 is never non-nil; the error return from compileDec is not used as far as I can see - all errors are sent via the error_ panic function and caught by catchError at https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/encoding/gob/decode.go#L1145 missing this check.\r\n\r\nThis means that the decoderMap entry is never deleted and so the decoder then sees the nil value.",
