	"body": "by **jtunney**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhen building Go I noticed that TestMulticastJoinAndLeave\n(src/pkg/net/multicast_test.go) failed with:\n\n--- FAIL: net.TestMulticastJoinAndLeave (0.00 seconds)\n\tleavegroup udp 224.0.0.254: setsockopt: cannot assign requested address\n\nI discovered this was because my system does not have a default multicast route (maybe\nan Ubuntu quirk?)  The solution was to run the command:\n\nsudo ip route add 224.0.0.0/3 dev eth0\n\nI hope this information helps and that this potential hold-up in the build system\ndoesn't prevent others from being able to use Go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
