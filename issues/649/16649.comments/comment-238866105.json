	"body": "Well, if you are up for some debugging, I think the first step is to find out which test is failing.  There are two places the program can print that message.  Then we need to find out whether signal is being sent on the channel, which you can discover by setting a breakpoint on the call to `atomic.AddInt32` in src/libgo4/libgo4.go.  If not, we need to find out where it is being diverted between `runtime.sigtrampgo` and `runtime.sigsend`.\r\n\r\nI totally understand if you don't want to tackle this.",
