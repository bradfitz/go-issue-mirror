Programs run\nnormally with ulimit -v 800000, and give segmentation fault with ulimit -v 700000.\n\nOn 32-bit linux, the programs needs 20 times the amount of virtual address space as on\n64-bit linux. You say, you can't explain why. So the status of this issue should be\n\"unexplained\", not \"unfortunate\".\n\nOn a web server running many complex processes, I use ulimit -v 500000, to prevent\nmisbehaving programs from bringing the web site down. That is why I noticed this thing\nwith Go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
