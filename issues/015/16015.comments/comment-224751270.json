The code says\r\n\r\n```  \r\np.printValue(f, verb, 0)\r\n```\r\nWe could instead call\r\n\r\n```\r\n  p.PrintArg(f.Interface(), verb)\r\n```\r\nwhich would extract the interface and print that. This works but only if the value being printed was not acquired by using Value.Field of an unexported field.\r\n\r\nWe could write\r\n\r\n```\r\nif f.CanInterface() {\r\n\t\tp.printValue(f, verb, 0)\r\n} else {\r\n\t\tp.printArg(f, verb)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand maybe that's the best we can do. Another possibility, maybe the right one, is to tweak the if at the top of printValue to know that the handle-methods check hasn't been done yet.\r\n\r\nNeeds thought.",
