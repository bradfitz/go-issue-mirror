With the fink\npackage, we have the option to run tests, but without support from the go build system,\nI can't split off the tests.  Since every user installs from source, this is a serious\npain point, especially on wimpier devices like the macbook airs.  Like less than a\nminute to build go and \u0026gt; 5 minutes of running tests.\n\n\n[SNIP TONS]\n# ../doc/codewalk\n\nreal\t0m2.273s\nuser\t0m1.941s\nsys\t0m0.252s\n\n# ../misc/goplay\n\n# ../test/bench/shootout\nfasta\nreverse-complement\nnbody\nbinary-tree\nbinary-tree-freelist\nfannkuch\nfannkuch-parallel\nregex-dna\nregex-dna-parallel\nspectral-norm\nk-nucleotide\nk-nucleotide-parallel\nmandelbrot\nmeteor-contest\npidigits\nthreadring\nchameneosredux\n\n# ../test/bench/go1\nok  \t_/sw/src/fink.build/go-1.2-1/go/test/bench/go1\t2.845s\n\n# ../test\n\nreal\t1m3.116s\nuser\t2m3.911s\nsys\t0m39.262s\n[SNIP TONS]\u003c/pre\u003e",
