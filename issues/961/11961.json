	"body": "For GOOS=nacl, we use the srpc service to communicate with the nacl sandbox to get things like random data. This is implemented in a quasi syscall, called sys_namespace (syscall/tables_nacl.go).\r\n\r\nThis syscall is present in pepper_41, but missing in pepper_44, which the current stable pepper version.\r\n\r\nFor Go 1.6, we should find out where this service has gone, and if there is a replacement. In the interim, nacl users should stick to pepper_41 or lower.",
