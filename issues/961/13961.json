	"body": "In the Go 1.6 cycle, users should be able to disable vendoring (in case they use directories named `vendor`) using `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=0`. This mostly works, but if the user imports net/http, it will not compile because net/http uses the new vendoring mechanism for http2.\r\n\r\nSee https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/DJNCzxcLvgE/UW15IK6rEwAJ.\r\n\r\n@bradfitz suggests that the fix is for the go tool to force-enable vendoring for the standard library even when `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=0`.",
