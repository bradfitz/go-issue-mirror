	"body": "Brad, I don't understand the point about Go 1.6.x. The only difference in\nthe bundle output should be a single import path line. Or are you worried\nthat Git won't know that the files moved and it will make cherry-picking\nCLs harder? I am not too worried about that, since I expect we will\nbackport only critical http2 fixes to Go 1.6.x.\n\nI'd still like to just edit the bundle output. Note that at the start of\nthe Go 1.7 cycle we can mv internal vendor again and undo the import\nchange. OR if it would make things easier that could wait until the end of\nthe 1.7 cycle.\n\nBut this seems like a http2-specific issue, for being a (too) early adopter\nof the vendor directory. People do put code in $GOROOT and I don't want to\nmake core changes to the logic in cmd/go in this case when we can make a\n1-line change elsewhere.\n\nRuss\n",
