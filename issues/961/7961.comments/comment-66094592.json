Per the spec:\n\n\"A reference to a method m is a method value or method expression of the form t.m, where\nthe (static) type of t is not an interface type, and the method m is in the method set\nof t. It is immaterial whether the resulting function value t.m is invoked.\" (\n\u003ca href=\"http://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Package_initialization\"\u003ehttp://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Package_initialization\u003c/a\u003e )\n\nIn the code mentioned above, when enabling the line (removing the comment //)\n\n\tx = T(0).m\n\nthe gccgo doesn't complain. But T(0).m is a method value, and T(0) (== t) is not of\ninterface type. The next line correctly reports a cycle, and it's only difference is\nthat it calls the method.\n\nPer the spec, whether the function/method is called is irrelevant (because the value\ncould easily be assigned to a variable which is then called afterwards, thus hiding a\ncycle).\u003c/pre\u003e",
