This code does your \"***ERRROR***\" line and sends a 204, but doesn't freeze:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/Awlpdc9DOo\r\n\r\nI think you'll need to provide a complete demo showing the problem, not just a snippet of code. I see that https://plus.google.com/communities/105964860738231827761 was a recommended Spanish forum in the other bug. Perhaps that community can work with you to create a stand-alone reproduction case and then a new bug can be filed if an actual bug is identified.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this since I don't see how to help.\r\n",
