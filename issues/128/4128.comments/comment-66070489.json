Typed constant\nblocks appear under the type, as you have found, so that when you look\nat the Duration docs you find the constants. This is something you\nhave to learn when reading the Go docs, but now you know.\n\nThe same is true for top-level functions that are constructors. They\nappear between the type they construct and the methods on that type,\nnot listed with other top-level functions.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
