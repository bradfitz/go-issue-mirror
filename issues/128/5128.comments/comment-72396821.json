The internal `prefix` variable ends up never being set to a correct value before being used.\r\n\r\nHandling it correctly will fix that particular sample I provided (http://play.golang.org/p/Pwn4cOHtMN), but it seems like it's not the same issue as what's described in the original post.\r\n\r\nShould I break http://play.golang.org/p/Pwn4cOHtMN out into a separate issue then? Or just consider this current issue to be it?",
