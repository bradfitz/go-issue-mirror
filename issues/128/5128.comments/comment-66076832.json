There is a know bug where formatting of /* comments is not idempotent\n(as witnessed in the first example above), and where formatting doesn't change anymore\nafter two applications of gofmt (as is also the case in the first example above).\n\nBeing completely idempotent is a very hard problem (short of simply running gofmt twice\ninternally).\n\nIndependent of idempotency, the question is what gofmt should be doing with /* comments.\nYou are suggesting that it should leave it alone if the first line is indented\ncorrectly. Perhaps that is the right answer. But I suspect there are counter examples.\n\nLeaving alone for now.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
