Specifically, using Xcode 5:\n\ng% cat x.c\n#define X 1\nvoid f(void) { (X); }\ng% clang -Wall -Werror -Wunused-value -c x.c\ng% \n\nHowever, the default assumption in cgo appears to be \"this is an expression\", so as long\nas we can make clang exit with a non-zero status cgo will do the right thing. That can\nbe done by putting a new statement \"1;\" in at the top of the function. I'll do that.\u003c/pre\u003e",
