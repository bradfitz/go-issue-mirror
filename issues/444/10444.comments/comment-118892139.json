	"body": "Pros of having touch.Event over event.Touch:\r\n- Third parties can export event types in a consistent way.\r\n- Names are shorter, user code will look less verbose.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Name collisions within the mobile package. If we want to provide utility functions for touch events, we need to find another package name. Since there are numerous events we support and will support in the future, we are reserving numerous good names to export event types.\r\n- Name collisions with the standard library.\r\n- It is not clear to me where the common types (such as `Change`) are going to live at? x/mobile/event?",
