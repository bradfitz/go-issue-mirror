Sometimes in examples to\nrepresent a list, and sometimes it is the operator \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;. It is clear\n(technically) from the surrounding text what is meant, but for beginners (like me) it is\nvery confusing at some places.\n\nPlease excuse me if this is reported elsewhere, I could not search effectively for\n\u0026quot;...\u0026quot;.\u003c/pre\u003e",
