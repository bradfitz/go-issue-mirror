I have also addd a fmt.Prinln( len(killChan) ) to see if\nthere is a sensitive timing issue here where the seqMaker is terminating in between a\nkillChan sweep and a message send.\n\nThe program still blocks.\n\nThe bug here is that the seqMaker message that is being sent on the line \"finChan \u0026lt;-\nprocId\" isn't making it back to the main thread or the message is making it and the main\nthread is failing to delete the dead channel from the map.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2867/4/borked2fmt.go\"\u003eborked2fmt.go\u003c/a\u003e (2017 bytes)",
