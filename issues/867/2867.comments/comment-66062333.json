If you do not see a goroutine in the list, then it does send its id to\nkillChan, and the main gorotuine can receive it.\nYour program is coded in such a way that it deadlocks, there is nothing runtime can do\nwith that. It's like put println(\"foo\") and then protest against it printing foo; if you\ndo not want it to print foo, do not put println(\"foo\"). That's it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
