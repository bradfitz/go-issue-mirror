	"body": "by **odysseus9672**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hg update default\u0026quot;, rebuild, and\nretry\nwhat you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Compile the attached file with the following line uncommented on a multicore machine:\n_ = runtime.GOMAXPROCS( runtime.NumCPU() );\n2. Run the binary.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nWith the line commented out, it produces the following: \n[0 333328333350000 666699 365645 260400 215080 182910 167713 147560 135780 132965 116831\n110544 114218 105595 96235 97104 97393 85815 84721 83070 80850 66990 63480 59360 54600\n49166 43020 36120 28420 19870 10416 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nWhat happens instead is the program deadlocks as all goroutines block. A message to the\nmain thread from a goroutine that is finished running is getting lost or the main thread\nis failing to delete the goroutine's input channel from the map. The message lets the\nmain thread know to stop sending messages to that goroutine.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g version weekly.2012-01-27 11507 on Mac OS X 10.6. Also on a Linux Ubuntu box.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n1107a7d3cb07+ weekly/weekly.2012-01-27\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2867/0/borkedfmt.go\"\u003eborkedfmt.go\u003c/a\u003e (2692 bytes)",
