In other languages you could have a global try-catch block in main, which would definitely always run if something bad happens. Frankly I expected the defer-recover in main() to work like that.\r\n\r\nIs there another mechanism to recover from such failures or is the only way to deal with it is to add defer-recover into every goroutine?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!",
