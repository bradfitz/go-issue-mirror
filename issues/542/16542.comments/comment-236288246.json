	"body": "If we did this (per-Server), we would still need a way to retain the ability for handlers to abort a handler and send an intentional stream break to the peer. Currently the defacto way to do that is to panic, which works in both http2 (by sending a RST_STREAM) and http1 (by closing the TCP connection which breaks any chunked encoding and the peer never sees the EOF 0-byte final chunk).\r\n\r\nI would almost say that adding the knob is a backwards incompatible change, since Handlers might then have a new meaning of panic, but the panic-to-close-stream behavior is not very documented or used, and this would be opt-in, so maybe it's okay.\r\n\r\nBut we'd need to bless \u0026 document an official way to break streams.\r\n",
