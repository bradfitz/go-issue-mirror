The docs say \u0026quot;Although the key must be an alphanumeric identifier,\nunlike with field names they do not need to start with an upper case letter.\u0026quot;\n\nSo we may need to go back to failing at run time for accesses to unexported fields, just\nlike other dynamic languages would do.\u003c/pre\u003e",
