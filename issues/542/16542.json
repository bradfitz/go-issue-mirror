	"body": "I would like to have the ability to turn off net/http server's current behavior to recover on panic.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to add a new package variable http.ServerRecoverOnPanic that has a default value of True which is then checked in [server.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/http/server.go#L1488) before the recover is issued. By making the default value of http.ServerRecoverOnPanic True, the current behavior to recover would be maintained for backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nIt is my feeling that the software designer should be able to determine when, and when not to recover from a panic, to allow for existing tools like supervisord to handle service crashes and to provide visibility and notification when a panic occurs.",
