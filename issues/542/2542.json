(hg identify)\n5ea674d1b2ba+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nconn() in exp/sql/sql.go:135 can return leaving db.mu locked if db.closed is true.\n\nThis is unlikely to show up in use as it requires ignoring the \u0026quot;closed\u0026quot; error\nand trying again anyway.\u003c/pre\u003e",
