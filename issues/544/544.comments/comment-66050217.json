Thanks for reporting this.\n\nBy the way, if you're avoiding your ISP's DNS server because it is too slow, might I\nsuggest 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4?  ;-)\n\u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/intro.html\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/intro.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
