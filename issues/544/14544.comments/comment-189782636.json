Is there a main.exe in misc/cgo/fortran? If there is, what does it do when run?\r\n\r\nThen, can you tell me the outcome of running the test.bash in misc/cgo/fortran with $FC (the name of your fortran compiler) as a parameter? Also for `$FC helloworld/helloworld.f90 -o main.exe \u003e\u0026 /dev/null; echo $?` (then without the dev null redirect).",
