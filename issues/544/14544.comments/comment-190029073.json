For instance, have gfortran put out an object file and then have the linker try to make main.exe.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to test if the gfortran lib search dirs are contained in the search dirs used by the linker CGo is associated with or in the CGO_LDFLAGS. Though with the search dirs allowed to contain .. symbols, and probably symlinks, you'd need access to something that is more than a simple textual compare. \r\n\r\nThe trouble is that it seems like requiring the Fortran compiler be part of the software package used for the C linker is excessively strict.",
