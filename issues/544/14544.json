What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version\r\ngo version devel +7da4ced Sat Feb 27 21:12:19 2016 +0000 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

What did you do?\r\n(Use play.golang.org to provide a runnable example, if possible.)\r\nRun $GOROOT/src/all.bash\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nA successful build and run of the test suite.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n```\r\n##### ../misc/cgo/fortran\r\n# _/Users/sean/goLang/go/misc/cgo/fortran\r\nld: library not found for -lgfortran\r\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\r\nFAIL\t_/Users/sean/goLang/go/misc/cgo/fortran [build failed]\r\nFAIL: go test\r\n2016/02/27 14:47:14 Failed: exit status 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root of the problem is that the gfortran I use is supplied by the Fink software distribution (gcc5 package). Because of that, I need to find a way to get this into the LDFLAGS for the build process: -L/sw/lib/gcc5/lib\r\n\r\nI've tried setting the environment variable before running all.bash, and that doesn't help. Ideally, there should three options that can be passed in to the build process to address this issue:\r\n\r\n1: an explicit path to the fortran compiler to use,\r\n2: the linker flag for things that need the standard fortran libs, and\r\n3: a flag to disable the fortran feature if it isn't desired.\r\n\r\nMaybe a set of environment variables (eg. GoFortran, GoFortranLibDir), where the fortran feature only kicks in if the first is set to the path of the fortran compiler and the second is a (list of?) directories to include in the linker's search space for fortran related builds.",
