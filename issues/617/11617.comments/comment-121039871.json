Both 386 and amd64 have distinct but *different* patterns: 386 is 0x18xxxxxx and amd64 is 0x20xxxxxx (on both openbsd and linux). Since Off is an int32, this would be only the bottom 32 bits of a 64 bit pointer and Siz will be the next 8 bits, which gives us 0xc820xxxxxx, which *definitely* looks like a 64-bit Go heap pointer.",
