I'm not sure where to look for the authoritative bits, but by hand I came up with 50000ff5d31 (nibble by nibble; probably in memory it would be 05 00 f0 5f 3d 01) , and that's what I see in memory when I look in the right order:\r\n\r\n    0x184d8ff5:\t0x11\t0xf3\t0xfd\t0xf5\t0xff\t0xff\t0xf0\t0xf0\r\n    0x184d8ffd:\t0xf0\t0xf0\t0x10\r\n\r\n(except for the final byte which I'd expect to be 0xf5 or something).",
