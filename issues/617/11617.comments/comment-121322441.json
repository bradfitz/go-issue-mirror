Since runtime.GC is stop-the-world, this suggests that it's not a concurrency issue or a missed write barrier, but we're simply tracing the Allsym list wrong. That could indicate a problem with the heap bitmap. If that's the case, gccheckmark=1 *won't* panic with a check mark failure, and we'll continue to see your \"sanity check failed\".\r\n\r\nBTW, I've been able to reproduce this twice in a cluster of 5 openbsd-386 VMs over the past few hours. I've tried it with and without gccheckmark=1 and have only been able to reproduce it without gccheckmark=1, so it could be that check mark somehow inhibits this failure, or it could be random chance since it takes so long to reproduce.",
