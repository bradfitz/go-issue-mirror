The only thing I know\n\u003e that's odd about it in this context is that there is no platform support\n\u003e for thread local storage but I can't see how that matters with an\n\u003e internally linked program link cmd/link.\n\nIt's a good question. My guess is that it has to do with thread scheduling,\nbut that's just a guess.\n\nI bet we could trigger this much more (and on other platforms) by adding a\nusleep(10) or something just after the mHeap_Free.\n\n\u003e The other q is, does this happen with GOMAXPROCS=1?\n\nI don't know. It would be good to confirm it doesn't happen with\nGOMAXPROCS=1, though it's hard enough to reproduce that if it didn't happen\nyou wouldn't really be sure it wasn't going to happen.\n",
