Remember that constants need to be ideal and\nhigh-precision. Even if you can store one particular floating-point\nvalue 100% accurately in a float64, any mathematical operation on it\nwill need significant work to figure out whether the result also fits\nexactly in a float64, and it almost never will.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
