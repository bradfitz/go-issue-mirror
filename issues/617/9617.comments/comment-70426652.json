Each interpretation is just as valid as any other.\r\n\r\nFor example, MST can mean any one of:\r\n* Mountain Standard Time (UTC-0700);\r\n* Myanmar Standard Time (UTC+0630); or\r\n* Malaysia Standard Time (UTC+0800).\r\n\r\nIf an abbreviation has meaning in a particular location, that's enough to resolve ambiguity. Hence \u003chttp://golang.org/pkg/time/#Parse\u003e:\r\n\u003e When parsing a time with a zone abbreviation like MST, if the zone abbreviation has a defined offset in the current location, then that offset is used.\r\n\r\nIn Europe (for example), MST doesn't have any particular meaning. Thus \u003chttp://golang.org/pkg/time/#Parse\u003e:\r\n\u003e If the zone abbreviation is unknown, Parse records the time as being in a fabricated location with the given zone abbreviation and a zero offset.\r\n",
