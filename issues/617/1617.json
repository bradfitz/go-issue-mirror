	"body": "by **consalus**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWith weekly.2011-03-15 (and tip) on darwin and linux 6g, when I try to compile the\n\u0026quot;gotcl\u0026quot; project, the compiler segfaults, apparently due to stack overflow.\nWhen run in gdb, it looks like the issue occurs in sinit.c. The stack frames show\nbouncing back and forth between init2 and init2list, though the eventual segfault\nappears to happen in init1. My guess would be a cycle in the Node tree.\n\nThis issue doesn't appear to happen with the \u0026quot;release\u0026quot; branch or the\n\u0026quot;weekly.2011-03-07.1\u0026quot; branch, so I assume it was introduced sometime between\nthe 7th and the 15th. I haven't gotten a chance to narrow the change range further.\n\nSteps to duplicate:\n\n   hg clone \u003ca href=\"https://gotcl.googlecode.com/hg/\"\u003ehttps://gotcl.googlecode.com/hg/\u003c/a\u003e gotcl \n   cd gotcl\n   make\n\nFor me on two machines, that results in a segfault.\n\nInterestingly enough, if one changes \u0026quot;chans.go\u0026quot;  by commenting out line 136,\nthere is no segfault and everything compiles normally and tests pass. This phenomenon\ndoesn't appear to be dependent on the position of \u0026quot;forchan\u0026quot;. When\n\u0026quot;forchan\u0026quot; is added to the map by other means (in init), everything compiles\nand it works fine.\u003c/pre\u003e",
