But on the other hand, `go run` should ignore the package a file is part of? `go build x.go` doesn't behave that way.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I thought that the \"a separate workspace\" aspect was an implementation detail, not the public interface, and that `go run` was supposed to be a shorthand for `go build` + `./a.out`, not for `cp foo.go /tmp/...`",
