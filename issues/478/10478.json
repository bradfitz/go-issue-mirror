	"body": "Commands built or run by listing Go source file names on the command line are treated as a separate workspace from $GOROOT and $GOPATH. The handling of /internal/ is not doing that, meaning that if you put an x.go in, say, $GOROOT/src/http and run 'go run x.go', it can import http/internal. That's a mistake.",
