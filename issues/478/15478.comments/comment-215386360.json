I believed until now that: import \"./package\"\nwas it.\n\nYes, packages are just directories on disk. They follow the url based\nconvention to avoid namespace collision and to enable go get. You should\nlayout your code using the url based pattern, but there is no requirement\n(unless you want someone else to go get your code) to push it to a remove\nvcs location\n\nOn Thu, Apr 28, 2016 at 8:45 PM, Tit Petric \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e I'm having the same result with go build, but I'll check the layout\n\u003e extensively. I followed the recommended layout from glide\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/Masterminds/glide\u003e - in the main README, which should\n\u003e be this:\n\u003e\n\u003e $GOPATH(/go)/src/your-project\n\u003e   |__ main.go (Where your main code lives)\n\u003e   |__ subpackage/\n\u003e   |     |__ subpackage.go (You can create subpackages)\n\u003e   |     \\__ ...\n\u003e   |__ ... (Other files or subpackages)\n\u003e   \\__ vendor/\n\u003e         |__ github.com/namsral/flag\n\u003e         |__ github.com/gorilla/mux\n\u003e         \\__ ...\n\u003e\n\u003e So if I understand you, instead of using \"subpackage\" I should create\n\u003e src/subpackage and use import \"subpackage\" as a replacement? I'm just\n\u003e about to go AFK into a meeting, and I'll try this asap. But it really seems\n\u003e that I shouldn't. Importing subpackages which reside in the same level is\n\u003e done with \"./package\", which is a documented thing somewhere. It actually\n\u003e *works*... at least some packages use a slightly different approach to\n\u003e structure the sources in the same way, with the double-slash import option:\n\u003e\n\u003e package main // import \"github.com/janeczku/go-dnsmasq\"\n\u003e import \"github.com/janeczku/go-dnsmasq/hostsfile\"\n\u003e\n\u003e Is there a way to achieve something similar for local development without\n\u003e a recognized VCS location? I believed until now that: import \"./package\"\n\u003e was it.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/15478#issuecomment-215384801\u003e\n\u003e\n",
