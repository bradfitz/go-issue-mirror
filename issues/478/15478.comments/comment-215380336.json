I might be quite new at this, but I'm\n\u003e pretty sure that nowhere in about 10-20 lines of code I'm going *outside*\n\u003e of GOPATH, and I'm not touching it in any way. The obvious question is\n\u003e \"what's the correct way to set up GOPATH?\" if the official docker image\n\u003e doesn't do this. Source Dockerfile is here, if you can spot the issue:\n\u003e https://github.com/docker-library/golang/blob/master/1.6/Dockerfile\n\u003e\n\u003e I'll attach my results if I can get my hands on on a local install of go\n\u003e somewhere.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/15478#issuecomment-215380064\u003e\n\u003e\n",
