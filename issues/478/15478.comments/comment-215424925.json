Vendoring starts to work, everything works with `go run`.\r\n\r\nI will not close this issue, just because I expect that this should be fixed in a future version. I hope someone agrees and tags/assigns the issue properly. Relative imports should work with vendoring, but I understand the motivations for FQDN imports. Considering that i'm using them from the main package, which is a reasonable \"root\" of the project, and if I'll ever reuse it from another package i would use the FQDN import from a VCS/other.\r\n\r\nIn the current state I would have to rewrite './' to $(basename $(dirname $0)) before doing go build/go run, which would require some external tooling like `gb`. Don't want external tools for something that simple.",
