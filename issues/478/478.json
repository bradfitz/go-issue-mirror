	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Calling binary.Write() with slice values doesn't work. For example:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://pastie.org/760660\"\u003ehttp://pastie.org/760660\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nOutput is \u0026quot;binary.Write: invalid type main.Test\u0026quot;\nI expect it to succeed\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux/386\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\neb3355e52683+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI understand that binary.Read() can't support slice types, because it \ndoesn't know how much data to read. However it makes sense to be able to \nwrite slices, because you know the length. \n\nUnless the go authors don't want this, I could implement the fix.\u003c/pre\u003e",
