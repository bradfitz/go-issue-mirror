	"body": "The `-l` flag of `compile` isn't documented at https://golang.org/cmd/compile/. Additionally, the `-N` (no optimizations) flag doesn't disable inlining, which could lead one to believe that there is no way of disabling inlining.\r\n\r\nThe documentation does say \r\n\r\n\u003e There are also a number of debugging flags; run the command with no arguments for a usage message\r\n\r\nhowever disabling inlining should fall into the same category of flags as `-N`, which is documented there.",
