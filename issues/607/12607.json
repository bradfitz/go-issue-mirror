	"title": "Suggestion: Enhance array initializer like 1..10 as Groovy Lang does",
	"body": "Initialize an array [10]int {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} is now shorten as 1..10 in Groovy lang, which is quite useful when a fixed size loop is required but the index is totally not interested. For example, to do this you have to: \r\n```go\r\nfor i:=0; i\u003c10;i++ {/*loop logic*/}\r\n```\r\nor, \r\n```go\r\nfor range []int {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} {/*loop logic*/}\r\n```\r\nNeither of them looks great, and the latter turns impractical when the range becomes 1..100. But if a range array initializer 1..10 is there, it becomes very neat: \r\n```go\r\nfor range 1..10 {/*loop logic*/}\r\n```\r\nAll we want is a 10-times loop, and it no more no less done this job. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this enhancement for the future release.
