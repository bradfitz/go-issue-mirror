(RFC 6265 allows it, I'm not too\nfond of the idea).\n\nE) Where should a CookieJar implementation reside?\nInside \"net/http\"? As a subpackage \"net/http/jar\"?\nBelow net directly \"net/jar\"?  Under exp/jar to\nexperiment with it? And how should it be\nnamed (Default[Cookie]Jar? Http[Cookie]Jar)?  That\ndepends a bit on answer to D)\n\nF) Currently the cookie handling in package http\ndoes not process the Domain and Path attribute of\na cookie. See\n\u003ca href=\"http://tip.goneat.org/src/pkg/net/http/cookie.go#L95\"\u003ehttp://tip.goneat.org/src/pkg/net/http/cookie.go#L95\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://tip.goneat.org/src/pkg/net/http/cookie.go#L122\"\u003ehttp://tip.goneat.org/src/pkg/net/http/cookie.go#L122\u003c/a\u003e\nShould I prepare a CL for these two TODOs first?\n\nG) How to handle the public suffices/effective TLDs\nwhatever you call them:  Domains like co.uk where you\nshould not be able to set a domain cookie as not all\nsubdomains are under one control only?\n(See \u003ca href=\"http://publicsuffix.org)\"\u003ehttp://publicsuffix.org)\u003c/a\u003e\n - Ignore public suffixes completely?\n - Read them once during the build of Go and use \n   that fixed list\n - Read that list during init() and fallback to\n   fixed list if e.g. no network connection?\u003c/pre\u003e",
