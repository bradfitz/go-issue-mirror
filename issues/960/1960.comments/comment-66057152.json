We can see if the host changes, but we don't know the path\nrestrictions on the original cookies.\n\nSo really we need a cookie jar interface on the Client object, which are notoriously\ncomplicated and security-bug-prone.\n\nSee: \u003ca href=\"http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2010/10/http-cookies-or-how-not-to-design.html\"\u003ehttp://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2010/10/http-cookies-or-how-not-to-design.html\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI suppose we could punt on this and only offer the minimum interface in the standard\nhttp package:  just the capability to add Cookies to a request before it's sent out.\n\nThat'd probably unblock you, right?\u003c/pre\u003e",
