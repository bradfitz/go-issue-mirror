None, right?\n\n(E) net/http works for me, considering (D).  But see (G), below.\n\n(F) They're saved. I'm not sure what those TODOs mean.  Validate that they're sane\nformats?  Sure, you could do that separately first if you'd like.\n\n(G) I don't want all Go binaries using HTTP to have a huge public suffix list compiled\nin, but it should be available for people who do want to use cookies, and probably by\ndefault.  That perhaps argues that the cookie jar implementation should live in its own\npackage, so only users who care about cookies get the public suffix list linked in.   I\ndon't think fetching it from the net at runtime is a good option.  That wouldn't work\nfor many corp/production firewalls anyway.\n\nLet's go with exp/.../jar for now:\n\npackage jar\n\ntype Jar struct {\n    // ... optional future limits / interfaces for storage?\n}\n\nfunc New() *Jar {\n   ...\n}\n\nRuss might have opinions on all this too, though.\u003c/pre\u003e",
