	"body": "git-codereview attempts to put a branch prefix on CLs when they're not on master. It uses the branch upstream for this, which works until it doesn't.\r\n\r\nThere's at least one invariant we can use to detect that something has gone wrong: The upstream must be called master or have a dot in it.\r\n\r\ncc @rsc \r\n",
