Without that, it can't do better, and even with fonts knowledge, there's not much it can do since it doesn't control how you view a file (what editor you are using).\r\n\r\nHm, I would expect the Arabic text in xterm to be monospaced? I don't read Arabic and it's difficult to see, but I have the same problem with Cyrillic characters, which certainly seem monospaced:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar foo = map[string]string{\r\n    \"foo\": \"bar\",\r\n    \"сииииияяяяя\": \"z\",\r\n    \"f1\": \"foobar\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003e There are plenty of people that (would like to) use a proportional font for programming (me included)\r\n\r\nThen gofmt for alignment is useless for you anyway. It already assumes a monospaced font even for plain ol' ascii. Fixing this won't change anything for people using proportional fonts, and it would fix it for people using monospaced fonts. No one loses.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that it should be consistent for *all* characters. Whether or not it's multibyte is not interesting... Having this work *only* for single-byte characters is going back to the 1980s and C...",
