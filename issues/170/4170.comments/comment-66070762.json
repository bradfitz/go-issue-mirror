Usually, WSARecv call in fd_windows.go\nis quick, because socket is configured for async io, and WSARecv just submits client\nbuffers to the os. All waiting is done in GetQueuedCompletionStatus. So, when\nclosesocket comes along, GetQueuedCompletionStatus unblocks and io completes. Not in\nthis test. We happened to call closesocket while another thread is in WSARecv. I am not\nsure why, but this makes WSARecv not return for a very long time. It returns much later\nsuccessfully, and even have some data, that belongs to different unrelated connection.\nThat is why test fails. Weird.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
