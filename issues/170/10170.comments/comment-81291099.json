The pull quote of the request is:\r\n\r\n\u003e Any `[]byte(\"foo\")` should be transformed implicitly to `[]byte{'f', 'o', 'o'}`.\r\n\r\nIf I perform that change to your example manually, there is no incorrect behavior: (See a [playground example](http://play.golang.org/p/x6i5N2uLR9) where two calls to this function produce different slices with different contents.)\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc g(b byte) []byte {\r\n\tvar x = []byte{'0', '1', '2', '3'}\r\n\tx[0] = b\r\n\treturn x\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm missing something and there is another example where this transformation wouldn't preserve semantics? In any case, an almost 25x speedup for a commonly used pattern with such a simple transformation could be important.",
