This is maybe not the same issue as the\r\ngeneral slowness one but it's maybe related.\r\n\r\nI have a bunch of gcc sources and builds here and there under my src/GOPATH\r\nwhich seems to confuse gorename a bit, maybe it has something todo with the\r\nfact that the gcc sources includes the go compiler and tests (?)\r\n\r\nA normal run of gorename spits out somewhere around a thousand lines like the\r\nones below this while running, there are also some errors about the tests of my\r\nGo repository checkout which I have under src for reference. The gorename -v\r\nargument doesn't seem to add any interesting additional information to let me\r\nknow what's going on.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPackage \"github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/libstdc++-v3/include\": open /home/thomasf/src/github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/libstdc++-v3/include/complex.h: no such file or directory.\r\nPackage \"github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/thumb2/libstdc++-v3/include\": open /home/thomasf/src/github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/thumb2/libstdc++-v3/include/complex.h: no such file or directory.\r\nPackage \"github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/thumb2/libstdc++-v3/include/parallel\": open /home/thomasf/src/github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/thumb2/libstdc++-v3/include/parallel/algo.h: no such file or directory.\r\nPackage \"github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/libstdc++-v3/include/ext/pb_ds/detail/bin_search_tree_\": open /home/thomasf/src/github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/libstdc++-v3/include/ext/pb_ds/detail/bin_search_tree_/bin_search_tree_.hpp: no such file or directory.\r\nPackage \"github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/libstdc++-v3/include/parallel\": open /home/thomasf/src/github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/libstdc++-v3/include/parallel/algo.h: no such file or directory.\r\nPackage \"github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/thumb2/libstdc++-v3/include/backward\": open /home/thomasf/src/github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/thumb2/libstdc++-v3/include/backward/auto_ptr.h: no such file or directory.\r\nPackage \"github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/thumb2/libstdc++-v3/include/arm-none-eabi/bits\": open /home/thomasf/src/github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/thumb2/libstdc++-v3/include/arm-none-eabi/bits/atomic_word.h: no such file or directory.\r\nPackage \"github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/armv6-m/libstdc++-v3/include/arm-none-eabi/bits\": open /home/thomasf/src/github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/armv6-m/libstdc++-v3/include/arm-none-eabi/bits/atomic_word.h: no such file or directory.\r\nPackage \"github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/libstdc++-v3/include/ext/pb_ds/detail/binary_heap_\": open /home/thomasf/src/github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/build/gcc-final/arm-none-eabi/libstdc++-v3/include/ext/pb_ds/detail/binary_heap_/binary_heap_.hpp: no such file or directory.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** I temporarily moved the three gcc's which gorename was complaining about\r\nout of my src directory and gorename finished a good portion of seconds earlier.\r\n\r\nMy `~/src` has 1800000 files in total with each GCC installation having\r\nup to ~19000 files each so they do represent a sizable portion of all my files in `~src` (~30%).\r\n\r\n(I'll revisit these numbers after I've had some sleep, a bit too tired for this atm)\r\n",
