	"body": "A naive reader of the minimal documentation for C.GoStringN() would be led to believe that it is a bounded version of C.GoString(), ie it copies a null-terminated string but stops after at most N bytes whether or not a null was found. This is not the actual behaviour, which is that GoStringN() always copies N bytes regardless of whether or not the 'C string' is null terminated before then. Since I recently made this mistake myself, I think that the cmd/cgo documentation should be clear about this.\r\n\r\n(In an ideal world I think that C.GoStringN()'s first argument would be an unsafe.Pointer instead of a *C.char, but I assume it's far too late to make that change even if people were inclined to do so.)",
