If I start your server and run the python script 100 times, then I\ndo in fact get the occasional error you reported, but that is not surprising: the python\nclient has hung up unexpectedly, and that is being reported.  Exactly whether the error\ngets to the server in time depends on TCP connection timing, I suspect.\n\nRegardless of whether the error gets printed, the connection close does seem to be\nprocessed correctly.  After running a few hundred runs of the python script, I ran\nkillall -abrt a.out and there were no unexpected goroutines, just main (listening) and\nthe epoll goroutine.\n\nSo I think this is working correctly.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
