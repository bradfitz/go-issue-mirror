The tzdata is needed only for time.LoadLocation.\nThe time zone information in the kernel used for time.Local (the local\ntime zone), but I do not believe it can provide information about other\ntime zones, and it does not use the standard IANA names.\nOnly programs that use time.LoadLocation need to worry about the\ntime zone data file.  If you can implement the same functionality,\nusing the same location names, with the kernel API alone, then I'd\nbe happy to review a CL.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
