You are seeing the hexadecimal dump of the\nbytes that compose the string \"171\" (the result of x.String())\n\nThis is working as intended according to the fmt package documentation:\n \"If the format (which is implicitly %v for Println etc.) is valid for a string (%s %q %v %x %X), the following two rules also apply:\n1. If an operand implements the error interface, the Error method will be used to\nconvert the object to a string, which will then be formatted as required by the verb (if\nany).\n2. If an operand implements method String() string, that method will be used to convert\nthe object to a string, which will then be formatted as required by the verb (if any).\"\n\nThis is why %d gives you \"171\". Printing x and \u0026x will give the same result because both\nof them have the String() method. If you want to see \"AB\", use\n\nfmt.Printf(\"%x\", int(x))\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
