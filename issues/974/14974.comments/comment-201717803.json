I originally thought that x/net used x/sys for syscalls, before going to plug my code into x/net and discovering that it imports its own godefs.\r\n\r\nAdding x/net/bpf sounds like a good idea, although it'll take me a bit more time to build an API for that - my current code just uses slices of tcpdump -dd output, which is obviously not great :).\r\n\r\nI also already have some code to set up an AF_PACKET socket with filtering, if that would be of interest, although it does not have any netpoller integration since (afaik) there's currently no way to get a netpoller-friendly AF_PACKET socket out of the net package.",
