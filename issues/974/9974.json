	"body": "Whew, that issue title is a mouthful.\r\n\r\nThe issue in question is newer linux ports, amr64 being the one in question, have dropped support for a number of \"legacy\" syscalls, ie `open(2)` was replaced by `openat(2)`, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe ppc64 port also faced similar issues (`select(2)` has been replaced by `pselect6(2)` for example), but not as severe.",
