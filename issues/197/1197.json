	"body": "by **bortzmeyer**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003e[This is not a bug but, in the possible templates when creating an issue, I do not find\n\u0026quot;Improvment\u0026quot;?]\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\n8e686f63c20b tip\n\n\nThis a patched version of the standard flag package, which I propose\nfor inclusion. The only change is the ability to \u0026quot;reinit\u0026quot; the parser\nto do a new parsing, starting at a different point in the list of\narguments.\n\nThe use case is for programs which include some form of plugins, not\nknown at compilation time of the main program. If you want the plugin\nto accept flags and arguments, you need to provide them after a\nnon-flag argument (so that the parsing would stop before) but then,\nyou cannot use flag.Parse() again on them. My patche solves this\nissue: the plugin has just to call Reinit(N) (where N is the number of\nthe first flmag/argument of the plugin) and can then use Parse().\n\nSee test.go for an example.
