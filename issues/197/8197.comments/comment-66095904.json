If I'd done this from scratch, I might not have used an ELF file.\n\nOTOH, debuggers probably do want a real ELF image: they can look at the DWARF call-frame\ninformation, and, if they're really fancy, they can even find the debug symbols that we\nhelpfully install (sometimes) in /lib/modules/KERNELVER/vdso using the ELF build-id\nmechanism.  So it's not that bad.\n\nThe actual cause of the 3.16 issue is that I'm trying to clean this stuff up.  It was a\ngiant mess two years ago, and it's gradually getting better -- at least we're converging\non one way of doing this instead of the giant mess that used to exist.\u003c/pre\u003e",
