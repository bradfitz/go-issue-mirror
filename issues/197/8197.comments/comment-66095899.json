Note that it's a huge speedup: it's something like 21ns vs 100ns. \nCLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE is even more dramatic.  And on 32-bit systems, you need the same\ncode to avoid using int $0x80 for all syscalls, which is remarkably slow.\n\nWe used to provide a service by which you could ask for the time by calling\n0xffffffffff600000, but that was a really juicy target for exploits.\n\nNote that Go is a bit unusual here: basically everything else already has a perfectly\nfunction ELF loader that can handle this.  And I did provide a nice CC0-licensed piece\nof reference code that worked fine, modulo Go-specific stack size issues.\u003c/pre\u003e",
