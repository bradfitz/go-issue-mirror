Admittedly, getting\neverything (i.e. Go, glibc, etc) to get rid of the vsyscall fallbacks may be a lost\ncause, but these days falling back to ordinary syscalls will be much faster than falling\nback to the vsyscall page.\n\nAlso, I'm not 100% convinced by your symbol version checking code.  I probably need to\nremind myself exactly how this is supposed to work.  The version checking code in my\nparser is much more complicated, and I assume there's a reason I did that.\u003c/pre\u003e",
