Switch to g0 in print functions (unfortunately there is a bunch of them).\n2. Re-implementing print/println in Go does not make sense, because it won't be anything\ndifferent from fmt package, which defeats the whole purpose of bootstrap print\nfunctionality. But we can simply rewrite print/println to fmt.Print/Println. This won't\nbe a bootstrap mechanism anymore, but will preserve compatibility FWIW.\n3. Remove print/println.\u003c/pre\u003e",
