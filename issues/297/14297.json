	"body": "Testing the new mips64 support, I ran into out of memory errors whenever the heap grew beyond ~500 MB. I isolated the problem to an apparent bug in addrspace_free (https://github.com/golang/go/blob/53b6661/src/runtime/mem_linux.go#L34). mincore returns _ENOMEM, not -_ENOMEM, if the given page is unmapped. Removing the minus sign makes the problem go away.\r\n\r\nI don't know if there are any platforms where the return value is actually negative. The equivalent function in the gccgo runtime also assumes a positive value.\r\n",
