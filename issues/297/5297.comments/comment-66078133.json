The TCP specification\nrequires that sockets go in TIME_WAIT state after being closed, usually for about a\nminute. You cannot reuse a local port number until the socket is gone.\n\nThe effect of that is that you cannot open many connections from the same machine to the\nsame server in a short timeframe, it's not a Go problem, and it's not a file descriptor\nproblem either.\u003c/pre\u003e",
