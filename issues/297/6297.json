Go build from sources on my underpowered NetBSD 6.0 beta 2 running\n   under VMware ESXi\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nSuccessful completion of all tests\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nFailure of tests on archive/zip.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g is involved in this case\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nNetBSD 6.0 beta 2\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ntip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nIt seems to depend on the available resources.  A very similar installation on a more\npowerful host operating under the same version of VMware ESXi does not fail.  Also,\noccasionally the archive/zip test actually completes successfully.  Still, some\ninvestigation seems worthwhile.\n\nCuriously, nothing explanatory is output, the most I got was:\n\nmyrtle$ go test -v\n=== RUN TestReader\n--- PASS: TestReader (0.05 seconds)\n=== RUN TestInvalidFiles\n--- PASS: TestInvalidFiles (0.00 seconds)\n=== RUN TestWriter\n--- PASS: TestWriter (0.14 seconds)\n=== RUN TestOver65kFiles\nexit status 2\nFAIL    archive/zip     60.896s\n\nLucio.\u003c/pre\u003e",
