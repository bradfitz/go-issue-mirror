If there's something to fix on Go's side, I have approximately 24 hours to do so before I disappear for a month, and at that point fixing it for Go 1.7 will almost certainly be too late.\r\n\r\nIs your comment at https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15425#issuecomment-214859826 still the latest summary? It's not clear what's that's doing, or why. And is there a server component that's necessary to reproduce it?\r\n\r\nCan you make a stand-alone repro using httptest.NewServer?\r\n",
