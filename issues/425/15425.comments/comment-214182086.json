If you remove the entire `onprogress` handler (including the unsupported code), the request still fails.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-04-25 at 12 28 38 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/940094/14776659/b384ba4e-0a7c-11e6-9b11-2e87e3bf3839.png)\r\n\r\nIt **should** fail with status code 413, entity too large. Chrome doesn't get *any* data back. `ERR_SPDY_PROTOCOL_ERROR` isn't a valid error for a Javascript logic error. It could be a bug with Chrome.",
