	"body": "I used the crypto/rsa's OAEP facility but found it difficult to work out given the documentation. I am not crypto-savvy so some of the details may be obvious to those skilled in the art, but perhaps it makes it even more important to document well to avoid trouble from dangerous beginners like myself.\r\n\r\nSome requests:\r\n\r\nThe package badly needs examples overall.\r\n\r\nThe comments on the constants are inscrutable.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the noise source in EncryptOAEP is unclear. Moreover, it looks like it cannot ever be nil. What do its properties need to be?\r\n\r\nDitto for DecryptOAEP, although here the source can be nil, empirically. What is the relationship between this noise source and the one in EncryptOAEP, if any?\r\n\r\nIf DecryptOAEP succeeds, that is, gets no error, what does that mean? Is further validation required? (This is one where an expert almost certainly knows this, but it wouldn't hurt to say.)\r\n",
