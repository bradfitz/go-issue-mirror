Why have you used time.Sleep? time.Sleep triggers a bug in that\nlogic. But w/o time.Sleep it exits in Go1.2 (Go1.1 does not build on my mac). Try this\nprogram:\n\nfunc main() {\n\truntime.Goexit()\n}\n\nThe logic that counts goroutines and exits when number of goroutines reaches 0 was\nalready there when I first saw scheduler (around Mar 2011, pre Go1). So this behavior\nwas there almost always.\u003c/pre\u003e",
