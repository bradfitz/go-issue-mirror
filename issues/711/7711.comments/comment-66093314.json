But Ken's original implementation counted goroutines\nand didn't exit until all the goroutines were done. I implemented the spec in change\n3ec90c85fc0d (Sep 22 2008) but I did not take out the goroutine counting. I should have.\n\nI am grateful that various accounting bugs (such as in time.Sleep) mean that the exit 0\nnever really happened in real programs. It means there can't be many people depending on\nit, which means we can correct the buggy behavior instead of being forced to preserve it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
