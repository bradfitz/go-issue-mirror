One possibility is a general way to have literals of arbitrary base, such as 3r012 where 3 is the base (radix), r is the marker, and the digits follow. This form has been used in other languages.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I don't believe any change is worthwhile. There is no pressing need for any of this. The current triad is convenient, familiar, and within a tiny fraction of being always enough.",
