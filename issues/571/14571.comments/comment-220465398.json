	"body": "It seems like the question here is whether os/signal.Stop is guaranteed to be an atomic operation.  I.e., if we call Stop(c) and c was the last channel registered for a particular signal, do we guarantee that concurrently receiving that signal will always either send to c or trigger the default signal logic?\r\n\r\nMy 2c is we should. If we call disableSignal in os/signal.Stop, then we should process any queued signals *before* deregistering c and returning.",
