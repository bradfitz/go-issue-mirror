Compile program as listed here: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/ZyH7hfsP2q\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/ZyH7hfsP2q\u003c/a\u003e (source is also\nattached to this issue report)\n2. Run program on OSX with GOMAXPROCS=1: it hangs indefinitely with 100% CPU load.\n3. Run program on OSX with GOMAXPROCS=2: it terminates after about 20 seconds.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe program, when run with GOMAXPROCS=1, shall terminate after about 20 seconds.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe program, when run with GOMAXPROCS=1, hangs indefinitely with 100% CPU load.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nMac OS X 10.8.3\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.1 darwin/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI tested the same program on the same system with go 1.0.3, and the problem of\nindefinite hangs doesn't appear there. Also tested on 64-bit Linux, couldn't reproduce\nit there either. This looks like an OSX-specific regression to me.
