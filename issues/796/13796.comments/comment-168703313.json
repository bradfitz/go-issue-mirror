Thanks for the insight. :-)\r\n\r\n\u003e A go-gettable package is just as usable.\r\n\r\nAgreed, it is as useable. Though not as practically applicable for the enterprise. I first need to find the third party functionality, lock into the proper version, and then trust them explicitly.\r\n\r\n\u003e In particular, as far as I know, the C and C++ standard libraries do not have these functions.\r\n\r\nFor C++ I would reference this:\r\nhttp://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/next_permutation/\r\nhttp://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/prev_permutation/\r\n\r\nAnd ruby:\r\nhttp://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-combination\r\n\r\nAnd as noted above, for python:\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html.",
