	"body": "Adding these methods to time.Duration would make it easier to write and read JSON data containing time.Duration objects. In Go 1.7 it will be possible to use maps in which the keys implement the two methods for marshalling and unmarshalling JSON.\r\n\r\nLike time.Time the amount of code added should be minimal, as time.ParseDuration and time.Duration.String are already in place.\r\n\r\nSome projects already wrap the time.Duration type to get this behavior:\r\n* InfluxDB: https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/toml/toml.go\r\n* Prometheus: https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/blob/master/config/notifiers.go#L309\r\n",
