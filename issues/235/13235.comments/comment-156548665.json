	"body": "The pointer analysis treats calls to exported functions in the runtime package specially because when the analysis was written, the package was mostly C code so there wasn't much to analyze.  Instead of looking at the source for that package, the analysis has built-in knowledge of the aliasing and callgraph effects of the important functions, which are few.\r\n\r\nEven though the runtime package is now in Go, I would not revisit this decision because the package makes such extensive use of unsafe.Pointer conversions, which the pointer analysis handles unsoundly: it treats a conversion from unsafe.Pointer to T just like new(T).\r\n\r\nYou can see the list of PTA intrinsics in golang.org/x/tools/go/pointer/intrinsics.go.\r\n\r\nSo, working as intended, and tough luck if you work on the runtime. :(\r\n",
