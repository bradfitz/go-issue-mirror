Looks like latest OS X's /etc/hosts contains\n\"fe80::1%somewhere_loopback_interface_name\" entry as a localhost. This is an issue on\nflaky test cases, don't worry about it and sorry for the confusion. I should update my\nlaptop to OS X Mavericks...\n\nP.S. Probably adding \"::1 localhost\" entry just before existing ipv6 localhost entry in\n/etc/hosts would be a workaround.\u003c/pre\u003e",
