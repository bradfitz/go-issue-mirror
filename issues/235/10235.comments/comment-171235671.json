	"body": "But what about the unimplemented syscall.EpollPwait() when syscall.EpollWait() is supposedly deprecated?  Unless I am mistaken, there is currently no way out for ARM64: syscall.EpollWait() gives ENOSYS: function not implemented error (from Linux kernel), but EpollPwait is not yet implemented in Go.\r\n\r\nThis currently affects fsnotify, which in turn affects Hugo and others, see go-fsnotify/fsnotify#112 and spf13/hugo#1772\r\n\r\n@bradfitz, I see that you dealt with a similar issue for the Perl Sys::Syscall package at bradfitz/sys-syscall#6, so you can't simply dismiss that that Linux-specific code requiring syscall.EpollPwait() as buggy, right?  :wink:\r\n\r\nShould this problem be addressed here, or over at golang.org/x/sys?  Many thanks!",
