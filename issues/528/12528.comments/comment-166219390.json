Then you can apply the patch to the Go sources with `git fetch https://go.googlesource.com/go refs/changes/27/18027/1`, `git checkout FETCH_HEAD` (these commands can be found under the \"Download\" menu in the top right of the patch) and run `all.bat`. Then you can rebuild with the Go executables this puts in the `bin` directory.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you can't build Go from source and I'll see if I can build it for you.",
