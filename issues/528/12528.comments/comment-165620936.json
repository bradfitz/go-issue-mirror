	"body": "I think the sigprof libcall case is actually safe. I thought that was equivalent to the sigprof cgo case, but if I'm reading the libcall code correctly, libcalls switch to the system stack and leave the G in _Grunning, which means sigprof libcall is actually \"sync\" in the above nomenclature (it's not at a safe point and won't reach one while it's in the libcall). Since every stkbar write is either \"sync\" or \"safe point\", that makes sigprof libcall safe.\r\n\r\nI think, to keep things simple, I'm still going to require that sigprof hold the stack barrier lock in this case. If I do understand the libcall case correctly, sigprof will always successfully acquire the stack barrier lock if the G is in a libcall, so no harm done.",
