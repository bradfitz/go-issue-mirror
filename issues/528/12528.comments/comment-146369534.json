What's happening is that an internal check for an invariant in the runtime is failing. Most likely whatever's going wrong is going wrong an instant before the failure.\r\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that the runtime isn't printing a stack trace, but there are other ways to get a stack trace. It's likely that if we can get a stack trace, the problem will be obvious. Please run your program under gdb, set a breakpoint on the panic with \"br 'runtime.throw'\" (note the single quotes), run it with \"run\" until it stops at the panic, and use \"bt\" to print a stack trace.",
