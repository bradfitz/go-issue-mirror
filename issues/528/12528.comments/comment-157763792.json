For 1, we're going to make gentraceback check if the starting PC is in stackBarrier and reconstruct a starting PC and the unwound stkbarPos from stkbar and the current SP. For 2 and 3, we're going to take stackLock around these operations and make sigprof only attempt to acquire stackLock once and otherwise give up (otherwise it may self-deadlock).\n\u003e@vsdutka ,  @daemonfire300 , can you still reproduce this issue easily enough that you could try out these fixes once they're ready?\n\u003e—\n\u003eReply to this email directly or  view it on GitHub .\n",
