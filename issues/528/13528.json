	"body": "Right now, if a `x/net/websocket` client connects to an HTTP endpoint and receives a response with any status other than 101, it returns an `ErrBadStatus` ([source](https://github.com/golang/net/blob/01256db42e5106196a3473ec1620727a383500e8/websocket/hybi.go#L448)).  This error does not include the actual status code received, and so users of this library are unable to distinguish between, for instance, 403 Forbidden and 500 Internal Server Error responses.\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to add a `websocket.HTTPStatusError` which implements `websocket.ProtocolError` and also includes an exported `Status` field.  This way, users could (if they wished) check the type of the error and switch on the `Status` field to determine correct behavior.",
