What does the extra allocations come from?\nI expect it's a bug somewhere in the runtime because the allocation test failures\ndon't come up until recently so this perhaps is a regression.\n\nSee also comments in the original issue report: \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/4974\"\u003eissue #4974\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e",
