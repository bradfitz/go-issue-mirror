Thus, at this point, the go.doc code cannot associate exported methods of\nnon-exported anonymous fields with the exported type containing those fields. At best,\nwe can do it for exported anonymous fields, and even then, the field types must be\ndefined locally (in the same package).\n\nA 100% correct solution will require full type information.\u003c/pre\u003e",
