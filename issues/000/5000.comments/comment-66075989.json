Then we let testing.AllocsPerRun ignore that, perhaps with a\nparameter.  AllocsPerRun was not in Go 1 so we can still change it.\n\nIt's ugly but it could work reasonably well if we are careful about what consider an\ninternal runtime reason--e.g., we would have to be sure that it doesn't correlate with\nsomething the program is doing.\u003c/pre\u003e",
