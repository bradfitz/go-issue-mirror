Flakiness\ncauses noise that constantly needs to be triaged. Should automated builds not run the\nlong tests? Is there some third class of tests? -test.flaky=true?\n\nIn my simplistic world view, tests should either pass with any and all values of\nGOMAXPROCS, GOGC, GOGCTRACE, test.cpu, etc., or control for these variables, or get\nfixed or get deleted.\u003c/pre\u003e",
