The fix would be to\npass \"true\" as argument to settype_flush() in mgc0.c. However, I don't recommend this\nfix because it wastes memory and increases the number of system calls.\n\nThe efficient solution appears to be a new memory allocator for internal use by Go's\nruntime with support for explicit deallocation only (like malloc+free in C, although\nsimpler code). The allocated memory would be completely separate from garbage-collected\nmemory.  Work on this allocator cannot start before Go1.1 is released.\u003c/pre\u003e",
