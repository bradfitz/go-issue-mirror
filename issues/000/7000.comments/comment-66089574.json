With GOMAXPROCS=16 with 9 seconds of execution\ntime, there is 550 seconds of blocking in crypto/rand.\n\nI see that websocket reads just 4 bytes of randomness.\nFor a security point of view, is it a good idea to cache a little bit of /dev/random\noutput? I.e. read say 64 bytes, and then satisfy 4-byte requests from that buffer?\n\nAlso I am not sure why we protect reads from /dev/urandom with a mutex?...\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-linux**, **performance**._",
