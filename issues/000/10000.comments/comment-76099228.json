It is readily available in the string header, registerizable, and cheap to compare.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to optimize further, instead of sorting (and searching) strings of the same length using cmpstring, we could instead further sort (and binary search) by the indices at which the strings vary--effectively doing something like walking a trie.\r\n\r\nI think that using the string length is worth doing right way. It should be pretty simple and a quick win. The fancier approach I'm less sure about, at least initially, since cmpstring is written in pretty heavily optimized assembly.\r\n\r\n",
