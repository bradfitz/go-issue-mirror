(Just looked at one with seven, for example.) Imagine that one part of the site needs to load additional scripts in the header, another needs a different organization's logo/name/nav links atop the page and tweaks to the legal boilerplate in the footer, a third wants to generate its title/description in its own way, etc. You make blocks to help do each of those things. That's part of why users want blocks and not just, say, a header template and a footer template.\r\n\r\nMaybe an example with two blocks is worth it, but maybe users don't need the handholding.",
