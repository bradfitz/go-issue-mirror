	"body": "I'm working on a localization design (doc going to golang-dev soon) which includes a proposed extension to templates akin to Soy. The most notable feature is a msg keyword with functionality not dissimilar to this, but different enough to not allow this as a solution.\r\n\r\nI can simulate a \"msg\" keyword by using {{msg}}/{{msgend}} pairs, instead of {{msg}}/{{end}}, but the latter form is clearly ideal.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the point is that the solution is fairly similar: parse the template using template/parse, rewrite the template to something understandable by the core template package, Execute.  So it may be an idea to instead of defining the new overlay construct in core, extend template/parse to allow user-definable actions and rewrite capabilities, similar to allowing users to specify Funcs.\r\n\r\nThe core library could still define an off-the-shelf rewriter like the one proposed. Although I'm a little bit weary about adding features to a core package for something that is just syntactic sugar. The rewriter for msg could reside in the text repo and would not need to be in core, etc.",
