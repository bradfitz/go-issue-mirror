One is that simply adds and drops connected routes (and interface addresses) on link-layer events such as physical-port/{physical/logical}-link/logical-interface arrivals and departures. The other is that just keeps interface addresses and notifies each status of addresses. The former example would be BSD variants and the latter example would be Linux (and Windows probably.)",
