FreeBSD also has the same behavior,\nand then made configurable with a sysctl.\n\nI'd think it's a feature for 32-bit compatibility (e.g. if you don't declare\nread/write syscall, its argument and return type will default to int, so\nthey avoided \u003e2GB case so that even in that case the error return value\nwill be negative and all success return value will be \u003e=0.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
