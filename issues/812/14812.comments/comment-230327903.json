My laptop simply didn't have the resources\r\n\r\nyeah it's not trivial to consistently trigger clear symptoms (large spikes). But it seems more load always seems to help.\r\n\r\n\u003e though I discovered if I left it running it would chew through my not-very-large root partition; thanks Docker!)\r\n\r\nI run https://github.com/meltwater/docker-cleanup/blob/master/docker-cleanup-volumes.sh periodically in between runs of the stack, this frees up space.\r\n\r\n\u003e It would be worth doing a heap profile with -alloc_objects to see if there are any sources of large numbers of small allocations that would be easy to address.\r\n\r\nOh boy.  I already went through weeks of optimizing memory allocations and what's left now is a bit harder.  IIRC the remaining inefficiencies are about allocating a whole bunch of strings (several for each incoming metric). optimizing that (splitting up in the incoming stream in separate data and metadata streams, string interning, using enums, etc) is on the agenda but will require a broader architectural overhaul \r\n\r\n\u003e I'll be out next week\r\n\r\nEnjoy your time off!",
