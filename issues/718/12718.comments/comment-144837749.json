All it takes is really rapid dragging left and right - at times from end to end of the screen; at times only in a small horizontal interval - for about 30sec to 60sec.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I tried to reproduce it with `-tags gldebug` but had no luck. If it's a concurrency issue (which I think it might be), then the internal synchronization in the `log` package (https://golang.org/src/log/log.go?s=4899:4953#L133) combined with the overhead of writing to stdout / file could be preventing it from occurring. Maybe you were trying to reproduce it this way and that's why you had no luck yesterday.\r\n",
