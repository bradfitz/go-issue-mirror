I got your demo building yesterday and spent a while trying to replicate the crash myself, but couldn't.\r\n\r\nCould I suggest: put a log.Print(\"frame start\") and log.Print(\"frame end\") at the edges of your paint cycle, then run with -tags gldebug. When you get a failure, take the last frame and compare the text to the first frame. Any variation could give away the bug.",
