The code that is executed each frame in the demo application is pretty much the same (at least with regard to the number and types of EnableVertexAttribArray/DisableVertexAttribArray calls). Unless I have coded something I forgot about, there should be no concurrent routines anywhere during rendering.\r\nSo if it doesn't crash during the first frame, it should never crash.\r\n\r\nStill, I am going to give it a try. Maybe I am missing something.",
