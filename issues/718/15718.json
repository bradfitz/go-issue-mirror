	"body": "ssa/sparseMap and sparseSet allocate a \"sparse\" array with length proportional to the size of an ID (used to index Blocks and Values) containing indices of elements in a \"dense\" array that must necessarily not be larger than the sparse array.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore sufficient to use an int32 as elements of the sparse array, but currently it is an int, or 64 bits on quite a few Go platforms.  We could save space by shrinking these.\r\n\r\n",
