	"body": "I'm writing some recursive code, and have been very careful to avoid allocations by being very nice to the escape analysis routines. However, I have some dead code in the source for debugging, whose body does cause escaping values if used (`fmt` and `panic` in my original code). The presence of the body of the debugging code, *even though it is dead and removed by liveness analysis* causes the escape analysis pass to consider the state to escape, forcing a heap allocation.\r\n\r\nHere's a simplified example:\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage recursiveescapebug\r\n\r\nconst debugMode = false\r\n\r\nfunc A() int {\r\n        b := 0\r\n        B(\u0026b, 5)\r\n        return b\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc B(state *int, recursions int) {\r\n        switch recursions {\r\n        case 0:\r\n        default:\r\n                *state++\r\n\r\n                if debugMode {\r\n                        // this is dead code, removed by the optimizer.\r\n                        // however, its presence causes the compiler to consider B's state argument to escape.\r\n                        panic(state)\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                B(state, recursions-1)\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen compiling this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go build -gcflags='-live -m'\r\n# _/home/username/testthing\r\n./recursiveescapebug.go:11: leaking param: state\r\n./recursiveescapebug.go:6: moved to heap: b\r\n./recursiveescapebug.go:7: \u0026b escapes to heap\r\n./recursiveescapebug.go:7: live at call to B: \u0026b\r\n./recursiveescapebug.go:11: live at entry to B: state\r\n./recursiveescapebug.go:23: live at call to B: state\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the dead debug code in the source code, I see the escape analysis properly determines that state does not escape.\r\n\r\nHappens with Go 1.5 and on a development version as of `efeeee38` on x86_64/linux, but is likely not related to versions or platforms.",
