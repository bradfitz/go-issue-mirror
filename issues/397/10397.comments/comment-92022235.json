Maybe it's a cmd/6l problem, but I'm not sure.\r\n(Note the address of stdout passed to fputs is: 0x680006f22225ff,\r\nwhich is the instructions: ```jmpq *0x6f222(%rip), pushq $00```\r\nused in the plt.)\r\n\r\nI thought the problem for stdout was that it uses the COPY relocation,\r\nbut apparently after external linking is introduced, internal linking\r\nwith stdout regressed. I will dig more and file a separate issue.\r\n\r\nThe PPC64 problem is unrelated to that though. It's because our\r\ninternal linking does not handle R_PPC64_SECTOFF relocation.",
