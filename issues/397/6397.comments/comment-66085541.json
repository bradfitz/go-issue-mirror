No cgo\ninvolved, so you won't have any control there. Also some windows APIs expect passed\nobjects to live after the call returned. In these instances, we just keep copy of\npointer in go code to prevent it from GC.\n\nWe do that. Our user do that. I don't see how you can take it away.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
