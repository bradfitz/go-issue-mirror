It might not work that way today, but what's\nkeeping the 6c compiled stubs from recording its pointers arguments correctly, thus\nretaining the memory pointed to from GC for the duration of the call?\nIn the case of a moving collector, the stubs could record its pointer arguments as\n\"pinned\" so the GC won't move the memory pointed to for the duration of the call.\n\nThis might slow down a (moving) collector, but if you can never pass Go pointers to C,\nmuch of Cgo loses its usefulness. In particular, passing C structs from Go to C becomes\nawkward and error prone.\u003c/pre\u003e",
