	"body": "by **john.souvestre**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI’m having trouble slicing a large array.  The slice is only 1 item.  The problem\nhappens when the array is 2**32 items or larger.  This works.\n\n  var r [int64(0x0fffffff)]struct{}\n  rr := r[:1]\n\nThis fails with “array len too large” on the second line.\n\n  var r [int64(0x80000000)]struct{}\n  rr := r[:1]\n\nI can go all the way to 2**64 before hitting the expected array bounds error on the\nfirst line.\n\nI’m running Go 1.3, 64-bit, on Windows 7.  I'm told that the problem does not occur on\nthe 32-bit version, including the Playground.\u003c/pre\u003e",
