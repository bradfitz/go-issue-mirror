Since we're proposing that benchmarks can emit custom metrics, that would require the parser to know how to conform arbitrary scalings of arbitrary units. It would also require that we specify much more precisely the syntax of units. Currently we've specified the unit syntax enough to make \"best effort\" rescaling possible in benchmark processors, but even if a processor doesn't understand a unit, it can at least expect it to be spelled consistently so it can match up results.",
