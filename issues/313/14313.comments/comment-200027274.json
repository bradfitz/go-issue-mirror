This is the difference between dimensions and units: one tells you what's being measured (e.g., \"time\"), while the other relates a value to a specific physical quantity (e.g., \"minutes\", and \"seconds\").\r\n\r\nI've actually been fighting with this in a general unit parser/renormalizer I wrote for benchstat, since benchstat wants to show a dimension for its own column headers, and values with nicely (and differently) scaled units in the rows. Specifying it explicitly feels *almost* unnecessary because you can usually derive the dimension from the unit, but you're right that some of the units used by `go test` are quite vague. Arguably, these units are bad: any two numbers in the same or conformable units should be comparable, but \"B/op\" could many any number of different things that aren't necessary comparable. It might be possible to always derive reasonable dimensions from \"better\" units, such as \"bytes allocated/op\".\r\n\r\nSo, another solution is to say that we know what ns/op, MB/s, B/op, and allocs/op mean, but any custom metrics have to have \"better\" units.",
