There is also the question whether a value unit with multiple slashes is undefined, forbidden or something else.\r\n\r\nIt's a fascinating question, but one that maybe we should leave open, at least at first. I can't think of any units that wouldn't have exactly one slash, but maybe (probably) I am just not thinking hard enough.\r\n\r\n\u003e I suggest to require all lines beginning with a # character to be ignored.\r\n\r\nNice catch. Thank you.",
