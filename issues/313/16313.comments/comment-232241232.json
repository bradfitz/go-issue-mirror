The x/foo repositories are perhaps not well\nsuited to this approach but it works OK for most things I've had to touch\nso far.\n\n\u003e And \"tools\", the dumping ground? librandomcrap.so?\n\u003e\nYeah, it would be especially ridiculous to do that for tools. We don't have\nany packages that depend on x/tools though.\n\nEven with that said, though, build-dependency loops are painful to work\nwith even if there ends up being no dependency loops between the resulting\nshared objects.\n\nCheers,\nmwh\n",
