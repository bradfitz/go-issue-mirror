The source packages, though, correspond to whatever is a single entity (think for example a tarball). In this particular case what you clone is a repository containing a whole bunch of Go packages that get mapped to a bunch of distribution packages, all coming out of a single source. The issue here is bootstrapping.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!",
