Why do you say that?\r\n\r\nI believe it's at https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.4.2/src/runtime/os_windows.c#L135 in 1.4.2, and [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/3cab4760d5ce8108c88984cb6c9849e598882b9b/src/runtime/os1_windows.go#L165) in latest master commit.\r\n\r\nTo [quote you](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/8687#issuecomment-66098531) from Sep 9, 2014:\r\n\r\n\u003e The problem is that we call timeBeginPeriod Windows API.
