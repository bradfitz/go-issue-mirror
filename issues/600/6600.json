	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWithin my code, I have the following structure.\n\ntype common struct {\n    Option1 bool\n}\n\nfunc (c *common) Method1() {\n}\n\ntype A struct {\n    OptionA int\n    common\n}\n\ntype B struct {\n    OptionB int\n    common\n}\n\nI want godoc to show that type A and type B have field Option1 available, and Method1 in\ntheir method sets.\n\nHowever, godoc would not show Option1, because common is not exported. It however show\nMethod1 (the full method set).\n\nThe only current workaround is to export common (which really is an internal\nimplementation detail), or duplicate the functionality across all types that share it. \n\nTO fix, godoc should show these promoted fields got from unexported anonymous fields. \n\nFor example, godoc output for A could look like:\n\ntype A struct {\n    OptionA int\n    // contains filtered or unexported fields\n    // Available from unexported anonymous fields\n    Option1 bool\n}\n\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version devel +47b2b07a837f Fri Oct 11 16:39:40 2013 -0700 linux/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
