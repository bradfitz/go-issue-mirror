So, I still can't apply \"go:nowritebarrierrec\" to `sysmon`. However, I think it's safe after the CLs I just mailed because *dynamically* we can't reach the call `gcallers` from sysmon because there's never a G.\r\n\r\nThe pain of all of this really makes me think sysmon should just have a P of its own that it drops when it goes to sleep.",
