The rewrite forces the\nlinking of all unicode table data even if you import unicode and only refer to\nunicode.Greek.\n\nRight now importing unicode and not referring to anything still pulls everything in,\nbecause the map init-time code keeps the dead symbol removal from working. But let's not\nadd a second reason.\n\nLeaving this issue open to be about making unicode take less memory, but I think we'll\nneed a different approach.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.4**, removed **release-go1.3maybe**._",
