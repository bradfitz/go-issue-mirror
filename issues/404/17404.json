	"body": "If use custome LocalAddr in Dialer, the localaddr changed,but the remoteaddr according to dns resolve  is not changed.\r\nFor example: two different ip IpA and IpB belongs to different isp in my computer. DomainC is what i want to send request to. So i use custome Dialer to choose which ip i want to use as my localaddr. Linux dig tool can resolve different ip use -b option sets the source IP address to IpA or IpB of the query. But in golang the ip resolved is the same. I use httptrace to find localaddr changed but remote ip is the same.\r\n\r\n",
