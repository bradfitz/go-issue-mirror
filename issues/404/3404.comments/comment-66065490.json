And that you can run \"some\" programs.\n\nWhat is important for us is to see the stack trace at the moment of crash. To know which\nof our system calls tickles your problem. Then we could decide where the problem is.\nUnfortunately, we do not get stack trace printed, so, perhaps, you could try and find it\nyourself. It is not easy, but I use print statements to ensure progress in my program.\nIt might get lower level, so you would have to use a debugger. gdb or\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.ollydbg.de/version2.html\"\u003ehttp://www.ollydbg.de/version2.html\u003c/a\u003e might help.\n\nDo you have issues with other programs on your computer? Perhaps, your driver is buggy\nand there is an update for it?\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
