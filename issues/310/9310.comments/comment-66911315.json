	"body": "The `go` tool does not know anything about version control systems when it is building packages and commands. That is a deliberate design decision aimed at simplifying the 99% case: you will get built what is present on disk under `GOPATH` at the relevant import path. You are proposing to integrate knowledge about VCSes into the `go` tool at a level that undermines that simplicity. You are the only developer I have heard from who wants to develop multiple versions of a package in parallel and considers having multiple working copies to be a problem.",
