I have my unit tests that make sure my API does not break within a major version. Why should I need to have 10 working copies when I just could switch branches and only actively use 2 versions?\r\n\r\n@dsymonds \r\n\u003e You are proposing to integrate knowledge about VCSes into the go tool at a level that undermines that simplicity\r\n\r\nNowhere I propose to integrate any knowledge about VCSes. Please show me where.\r\nWhat is not simple about the \"alternative\" implementation:\r\n\r\n\u003e    1. Make go build and go install ignore the canonical path if no package name is given.\r\n\r\nI think this is what everybody expects, since when I am inside the package to develop and run `go build`I just expect it to work regardless of how my package is represented to the outside world (i.e. vanity).",
