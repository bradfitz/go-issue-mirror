We just have to allocate using\nan allocator that the Go GC does not examine.\n\nIf this is provided by Go runtime or similar, then it should work just fine. I assume we\nare talking about memory that needs to live after syscall returns. You would have to\nfind a separate solution for any code that just uses Go memory during syscall, just like:\n\nvar x C.T\nC.f(\u0026x)\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
