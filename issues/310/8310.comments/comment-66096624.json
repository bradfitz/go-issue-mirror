If Go\nmaintains the pointer while C is doing stuff with the underlying data, is that okay? In\ngithub.com/gonum/blas/cblas [0], we send []float64 to C by sending unsafe.Pointer(\u0026x[0])\nto C. The x variable stays alive on the Go side, but the values it points to are\nmodified by the C code. Is the plan to still support this?\n\n[0] \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/gonum/blas/blob/master/cblas/blas.go\"\u003ehttps://github.com/gonum/blas/blob/master/cblas/blas.go\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
