It is a stack split bug: the function has a stack frame\nthat is just barely big enough to warrant allocating a bit more than the default size\nstack segment, but the linker gets the logic wrong and does not trigger this.  The fix\nis easy, but I want to write a more thorough test.  I will have this fixed tomorrow.\u003c/pre\u003e",
