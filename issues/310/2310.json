	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eSome Go documentation is inevitably platform dependent. For example, in pkg/os, the\nVariables section shows variables defined for the Plan 9 port, whereas the Hostname\nfunction points to a Linux-specific source file; pkg/syscall shows a mix of functions\nfrom all different architectures.\n\nIt would be great if godoc could show a coherent API, taking into account\nplatform-specific differences.\n\nPerhaps, for any given page, it could detect if there was some platform dependent\ndocumentation, and provide a selection menu at the top to choose the platform. For a\nfunction or type defined differently across several architectures, the selection menu\nmight be provided directly at the site of the function documentation.\u003c/pre\u003e",
