TLS, for instance.\n\nAnd not that POSIX matters to us since we get to make up the semantics for\nthe standard library, but we should keep the following in mind:\n\n\"If nbyte is zero and the file is not a regular file, the results are unspecified.\"\n   - POSIX.1-2008 on write\n\n\"How read() handles zero-byte STREAMS messages is determined by the current read mode\nsetting. [...] In message-nondiscard mode or message-discard mode, a zero-byte message\nshall return 0 and the message shall be removed from the STREAM.\"\n   - POSIX.1-2008 on read\n\nUsing a zero-length read as EOF is a very old and useful convention but that's all it\nshould be.\u003c/pre\u003e",
