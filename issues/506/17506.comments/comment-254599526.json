You must use the `t1.Equal(t2)` method.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that time.Now() always has the magic \"local\" location. time.Parse when given a numeric timezone will use the \"local\" location if that is a valid offset for the local timezone, and otherwise will create a new Location with the fixed offset.\r\n\r\nI suspect your Docker container has UTC as the default timezone, but your local machine has a different timezone.",
