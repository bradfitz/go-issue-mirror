The\nissue with malloc was fixed in \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/5926\"\u003eissue #5926\u003c/a\u003e with a wrapper and Go/the standard library do\nnot use calloc or realloc or any other function that has the size_t/ulong issue\nthemselves and doesn't have any tests for that, either.\n\nThe problem will only manifest with user written code that uses cgo and for example\ncalloc or realloc with size_t arguments.\n\nThe reason I think this should be addressed somehow, if possible is because it will make\nold cgo code fail on OS X Mavericks in a confusing way because of a subtle difference in\ngcc and clang.\u003c/pre\u003e",
