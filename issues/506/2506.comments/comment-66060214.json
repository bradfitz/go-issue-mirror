This is a bug report about the fact that the combination of some\nCGO code and goinstall produce an executable that seg faults when it should be producing\nreasonable output.  The included code is a distillation of my full application to a\nminimal test case that can cause the seg fault.  I thing the problem boils down to the\nlinker putting a constant value in an 8-byte aligned location when it should be 16-byte\naligned.\u003c/pre\u003e",
