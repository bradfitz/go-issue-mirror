	"body": "`vcs.RepoRootForImportDynamic` requires that all vanity imports contain at least one `/` character: https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/c0008c5889c0d5091cdfefd2bfb08bff96527879/go/vcs/vcs.go#L483-L486\r\n\r\nHowever, the documentation for vanity imports does not forbid vanity imports that do not contain a `/` (i.e., those at the root of a domain): https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Remote_import_paths\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, `go get` (I tested 1.5.2) appears to do just fine with a vanity import located at the root of a domain. You can try `go get goji.io` as an example of this behavior.\r\n\r\nThis originally surfaced as a bug report against godoc.org, which uses similar logic (although it does not actually use the same code): https://github.com/golang/gddo/issues/355. This bug report is, as much as anything, a spec clarification for that project.",
