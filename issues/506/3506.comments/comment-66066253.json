This is not a great\nassumption, but it is what it is for now.  If you make the dates\non the compiler older than the dates on the .a files I think everything\nwill be happy.\n\nThis is something we should decide for Go 1.1.  Right now I think\nthe only option is the workaround.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **go1.1**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
