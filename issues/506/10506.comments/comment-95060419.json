Are you testing this on current master? The multiple namespace definitions in your XML dump hint at a problem in the XML package that recently has been fixed by Roger Peppe. Could you please retry with a recent Go version that, as a minimum, includes the following CLs:\r\n\r\n    https://go-review.googlesource.com/6927\r\n    https://go-review.googlesource.com/5910\r\n    https://go-review.googlesource.com/2660\r\n\r\nAs an additional data point, It works for me with go version devel +ecd630d. The most recent master should include all the XML goodness.\r\n\r\n@tgulacsi I see that you are on go devel, but are you sure your version includes the afore mentioned XML fixes? Also, could you please paste the full OPTIONS/PROPFIND HTTP transfer here? Gvfs might choke because the XML marshalling is broken in your environment, or it might because of a bug in the property system implementation. Without the HTTP trace I can't really tell.\r\n\r\nFYI f you run litmus like \r\n    \r\n    $ TESTS=\"props\" ./bin/litmus http://localhost:9999/\r\n\r\nit will only run the props suite. On my machine, this outputs\r\n\r\n    -\u003e 16 tests were skipped.\r\n    \u003c- summary for `props': of 14 tests run: 10 passed, 4 failed. 71.4%\r\n    See debug.log for network/debug traces.\r\n",
