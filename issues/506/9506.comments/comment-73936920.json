	"body": "@adg, did you want to work on this?\r\n\r\nWe'll need to snapshot the \"go\" directory after make.{bash,bat,rc} and put it on GCS.  Probably in a new bucket.\r\n\r\nAnd then when we need to build a subrepo, we instead untar the pre-built make output from GCS onto the buildlet, and then run just the subrepo tests.\r\n\r\nDoing the snapshot after `make.bash` means we need to actually run make.bash separately, and not all.bash.  This ties in with the main repo test sharding later, wherein we'll snapshot after make.bash and then start N VMs over which to run all the tests. But for now you'll need to modify the coordinator to run `make.bash`, snapshot, and then `run.bash`",
