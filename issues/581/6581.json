This could\nbe seen as being in keeping with\n\n\u0026quot;The arguments to a Call on the returned function should not include a receiver;\nthe returned function will always use v as the receiver.\u0026quot;\n\nThe potentially surprising implications of this could be clarified though, since the\nfocus of this statement appears to be on the fact that you don't need to provide your\nown receiver on each call, rather than on a deviation of the behaviour of the method\nfrom the language feature it approximates.\u003c/pre\u003e",
