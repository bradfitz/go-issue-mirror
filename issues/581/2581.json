	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI have a program that listens on tcp port 8080, gets its *net.TCPListener's File()\n*os.File, and passes that to a child process via exec.Command.ExtraFiles.  The idea is\nfor the child to then use that listener with net.FileListener.\n\nAs a test, I wanted to verify that the child would fail to re-listen on that port.\n\nOn Linux, as expected, the child gets an error trying to re-listen on port 8080.\n\nOn OS X, the listen succeeds (and lsof shows two entries with identical contents), but\nthe accept hangs forever on the second dup listener (which in itself isn't surprising). \nWhat's surprising is that the dup Listen even succeeded.\n\nI'd like to know if OS X just sucks, or we have some portability problem here.\n\nI can refine this to a test case, but filing this bug before I forget.\u003c/pre\u003e",
