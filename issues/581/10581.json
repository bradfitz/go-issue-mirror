	"body": "Hi,\r\nI've faced the following misunderstanding. The ref/spec says that:\r\n\u003e Given a struct type S and a type named T, promoted methods are included in the method set of the struct as follows:\r\n\u003e * If S contains an anonymous field T, the method sets of S and *S both include promoted methods with receiver T. The method set of *S also includes promoted methods with receiver *T.\r\n\r\nSo I expect to get an error accessing promoted method of S with anonymouse field T with the receiver *T:  [see playground] (https://play.golang.org/p/7BPil8G9Jp)\r\nBut it compiles well and gives the correct answer instead of an error.",
