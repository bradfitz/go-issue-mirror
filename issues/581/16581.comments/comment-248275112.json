After a search, your comment was the only thing I could really find that says it explicitly. https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/ says nothing about HTTP2 being disabled if you specify a `TLSClientConfig`. Can we get a way to enable HTTP2 and specify a `TLSClientConfig` without requiring the external dependency? If my request is reasonable I am happy to create a separate issue.\r\n\r\n",
