	"body": "Now that we have SmartOS builders on Joyent in a custom image using the buildlet, let's use the Joyent API and dynamically create the containers as needed. This should be done by creating a new pool type in x/build/cmd/coordinator, similar to the GCE, reverse, and Kubernetes pool types.\r\n\r\nThis will both be cheaper (run zero when we need zero), but also let us scale from 0 to dozens as needed and let us do sharded builds and let SmartOS be a trybot. (currently we just run 2 containers all the time)\r\n\r\nI see lots of joyent stuff at https://godoc.org/?q=joyent \r\n\r\n/cc @davecheney @4ad ",
