It was introduced by CL 3024, which is part of go1.5.\r\n\r\n\u003e The network mask code looks good, but I don't have a Windows XP image to test the first prefix code.\r\n\r\nI have Windows XP computer. I visually checked my new netmasks looks good.\r\n\r\n\u003e However, you left out a way to filter out the non active interfaces. See #12812\r\n\r\nCL 16854 fixes issue #12811. It has nothing to do with issue #12812. One thing at a time. Do you have a suggestion for a test I can use for issue #12812?\r\n\r\n\u003e I think it would be best to merge the fix for this issue (12811) with 12812. Then test and release them together as part of Go 1.6.\r\n\r\nI disagee. These bugs are not related in any ways. It will be much easier (and quicker) to have 2 simple fixes approved, then 1 combined - bigger and more complicated. Both fixes can go into go1.6 (if they make deadline).\r\n\r\nAlex",
