However, since you are the Go expert, you would know better than I what is the best way to bring this to general availability.\r\n\r\nI found issue 12812 because my laptop has WiFi, 1000base-T, and several VPN connections as shown in the image below.  All of the interfaces that have an X are not active but show up in \u003ccode\u003epaddr\u003c/code\u003e list.  The ones that are actually active will have a \u003ccode\u003epaddr.OperStatus == windows.IfOperStatusUp\u003c/code\u003e.\r\n\r\n![networksettings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13941653/11174152/f7be9148-8bd4-11e5-8c0e-c60e32c787ba.png)\r\n\r\nI can send you the code for my \"fix\" if you like, but if you are separating the solutions, it might not do you much good. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nKevin\r\n",
