	"body": "I guess the concern is that C code might use I/O instructions and non-cacheable memory but fail to call `HWSYNC`?  I have no idea how much of a problem that would be.  We could add `HWSYNC` instructions to the code that moves between C and Go easily enough.  Calling from Go to C will go through the function `asmcgocall` in runtime/asm_ppc64x.s.  Calling from C to Go will go through the function `crosscall2` in runtime/cgo/asm_ppc64x.s (note that those are two files with the same name in two different directories).",
