	"body": "I was out a few days last week and Bishop is now out through the end of next week.  Lots of good discussion here to help understand the situation.  Here is my suggestion on how to proceed.\r\n\r\nBishop has proposed changes to some of the atomic functions to use LWSYNC instead of HWSYNC to improve performance.  Most of these are in the runtime/internal atomics.  Once he gets back he can submit his change.  Bishop has studied the Go scheduler more than I but I see Keith's point about the runqput functions doing locks when swapping goroutines and how that should meet the requirement of doing a sync and clearing the reservation.",
