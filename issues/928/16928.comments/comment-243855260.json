	"body": "It certainly seems like a bad thing to write code with lwarx and stcwx that way.  Are you saying not to worry about that case and if someone reported it they would be told it's illegal?  I don't think it would have to be Go asm, I think someone could write a C program with inline assembly to do the same.\r\n\r\nLet me back up to what prompted this issue to begin with.  We are looking at ways to improve some of the atomic loads and stores on ppc64le so they don't have to do as many syncs -- maybe remove some or replace with lwsync in some cases.  Changing some of those would depend on having a sync in gosave when a goroutine is swapped off a thread.  So my thought was to put the change into gosave first separately and then follow with the other changes to some of the atomics.  If it's preferred that all changes related to syncs and lwsyncs are done in one change we can do that instead.",
