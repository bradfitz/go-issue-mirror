	"body": "The error means that Go sees a pointer into the Go heap that the Go GC is not aware of.  This is a serious error that you shouldn't cover up by setting GODEBUG=cgocheck.  Or there is a bug in the checking code, of course, although it seems pretty simple.\r\n\r\nYou could create an error of this sort by calling the C function `free` with a Go pointer.  You should check that you are not doing that.\r\n\r\nCould you try running your program with GODEBUG=cgocheck=2 to see if the stricter checks find an earlier problem?\r\n\r\nIs there a way we can try running this program ourselves to recreate the problem?",
