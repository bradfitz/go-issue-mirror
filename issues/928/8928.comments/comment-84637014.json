The server included every CA configured on my system in the CertificateRequest message, which (in my case) was ~11,000 bytes of data (and then I also had the server cert, hello etc).\r\n\r\nIt sounds like after this patch, users may now hit the message \"tls: oversized record received with length %d\".  Remembering to configure the accepted CAs for client certs would fix the problem I hit.",
