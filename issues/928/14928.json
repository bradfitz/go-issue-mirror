	"body": "This seems like a significant addition that should be mentioned.\r\n\r\nAssociated with this is a change to net/http/httptest.ResponseRecorder\r\nthat ended up breaking our tests because for historical reasons\r\nwe were constructing the ResponseRecorder directly with the HeaderMap\r\nfield, expecting that that be reflected in result of the Header method,\r\nbut that's no longer the case.\r\n\r\nIt was an easy fix and we shouldn't have been doing that anyway, but\r\na reminder that it's easy to break things even when keeping the\r\nexposed API ostensibly the same.\r\n",
