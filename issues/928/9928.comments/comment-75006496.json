Would I have to first TrimRight for every string or instead perform two separate calls?\r\n```go\r\ndir, file := filepath.Dir(p), filepath.Base(p)\r\n```\r\nI see your response directly helps with walking but the last sentence doesn't fit my issue which is that the dir and file should then be extracted. In the original examples, if I wanted dir, file, I would still be stuck in that infinite loop, something a user that hasn't investigated this issue would not be aware of unless they performed a trim or two separate function calls.",
