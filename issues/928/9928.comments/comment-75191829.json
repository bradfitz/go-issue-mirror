I realize that it isn't Go's behavior to make the transition from other languages to using Go intuitive, and probably change semantics just for that case since Go has its own docs and specs. However, it took me a lot of hours and a couple of bugs reported in a program that I am using this for, for me to investigate it. I was expecting filepath.Split to be deterministic the way other languages have it, regardless of whether there was a trailing '/' or not.\r\n@mattn sounds like a plan. I was actually doing a strings.Trim*.\r\n\r\nCorrection: * Go's responsibility instead of Go's behavior. ",
