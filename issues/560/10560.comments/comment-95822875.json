Instead, we use the same the trick that other Darwin ports\nuses (guess the\nTLS offset by bruteforcing the TLS slot for a pthread_setspecific key, or\nvice versa).\n\nAndroid/arm is different, we don't use .tbss either, but I don't fully\nunderstand Android/ARM\nto give a definite answer. (That's the reason my previous clean up attempt\nbroke Android/ARM.)\n",
