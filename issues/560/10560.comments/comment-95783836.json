I don't understand how not supporting TLS relocations matters when not externally linking, but I guess we're talking about things like android where we technically make a shared object but one that behaves more like an executable on a traditional platform, and they basically implement the \"initial exec\" tls model by hand?\r\n\r\nStill feels to me like cmd/internal/obj is the place to put the special casing -- the linker will need code for each special case of course, but deciding which special case to use should be done earlier IMHO (so I mean, codegen decides which reloc type to use and linker always interprets a given reloc type the same way on a given arch).",
