What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  darwin/amd64\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\n  `$GOPATH/src/github.com/petejkim/foo/foo.go`\r\n  ```\r\n  package foo\r\n\r\n  func DoSomethingWithLocation(lat, long, alt float64) float64 {\r\n  \treturn 0.0\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  $ gomobile bind -target=ios github.com/petejkim/foo\r\ngomobile: darwin-armv7: go build -p=8 -pkgdir=/Users/jihoon/code/go/pkg/gomobile/pkg_darwin_arm -tags=\"\" -buildmode=c-archive -tags=ios -o /var/folders/7t/zvcfl61j57d722hzvyxm5cym0000gn/T/gomobile-work-326555581/foo-arm.a /var/folders/7t/zvcfl61j57d722hzvyxm5cym0000gn/T/gomobile-work-326555581/src/iosbin/main.go failed: exit status 2\r\n  # _/var/folders/7t/zvcfl61j57d722hzvyxm5cym0000gn/T/gomobile-work-326555581/src/gomobile_bind\r\n  /var/folders/7t/zvcfl61j57d722hzvyxm5cym0000gn/T/gomobile-work-326555581/src/gomobile_bind/GoFoo.m:21:54: error: parameter name omitted\r\n  /var/folders/7t/zvcfl61j57d722hzvyxm5cym0000gn/T/gomobile-work-326555581/src/gomobile_bind/GoFoo.m:23:25: error: expected expression\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n  I expected it to show an error saying it cannot be compiled due to the presence of reserved keyword `long`. It would be better if it could just handle it automatically by perhaps prepending/appending `_` to the reserved keyword (`_long`) to avoid Obj-C compilation error.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n  A cryptic error message. It took me a while before I realized it was due to the argument name `long` (short for `longitude` in my case), which is a reserved keyword (a data type) in ObjC.",
