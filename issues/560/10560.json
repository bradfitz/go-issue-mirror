	"body": "Right now the tls offset for g is hardcoded to be 0x10 in the\r\nruntime. This works as long as Go program is the only thing\r\nthat uses TLS.\r\n\r\nWe should clean it up and use proper TLS relocations for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nAlso, we should also investigate removing all the special\r\ncase in cmd/internal/obj/arm and linkers for runtime.tlsg for\r\nARM by introducing a unified framework for dealing with\r\nruntime.tlsg (runtime.tls_g on arm64).\r\n\r\nSee also #10557.",
