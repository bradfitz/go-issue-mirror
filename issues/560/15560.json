	"body": "In an attempt to fix the behavior of [httptest.ResponseRecorder](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptest/#ResponseRecorder) to mimic reality more closely (issues #8857 and #14914), commit c69e6869c9793872cb0282008ea8ab643a92da65 broke reality in the opposite end: now the recorder will not display headers unless one of `Write`, `WriteHeader`, or `Flush`, is called explicitly, which is not what happens on an actual handler.\r\n\r\nThis broke actual tests we had in 1.6 after running with the `httptest` package from tip.\r\n\r\nAs a suggested fix for both cases, the recorded headers should be frozen when `Write` or `WriteHeader` is observed, rather than completely hidden from tests until then.",
