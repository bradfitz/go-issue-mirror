What happens is that if the os package sees an\nEPIPE error returned by a syscall, it calls os.sigpipe.  os.sigpipe exists on Windows,\nand just exits with an error message.  So I was just trying to say that everything\nshould work OK provided the Windows implementation of epipecheck notices the error\nreported by the original bug report.\n\nOf course if the bug report is erroneous then just ignore what I am saying.\u003c/pre\u003e",
