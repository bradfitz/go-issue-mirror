Would\nyou be able to provide some sort of stack trace, so I can at least see where it is\nhappening. Thank you.\n\nDo not worry about looking for EPIPE or ERROR_PIPE_NOT_CONNECTED in\n/mingw/include/winerror.h, because we do not use winerror.h. Any error constants we use\nare hardcoded in syscall.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
