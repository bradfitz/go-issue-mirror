Is it possible that\nyour \"less\" command is different from mine? Perhaps it exits early for some reason.\n\nIan, I don't understand what you are saying. On Windows, programs can't send \"signals\"\nto each other. The only thing that less can do is close its end of the pipe, this will\nlook like syscall returned with an error on godoc side.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
