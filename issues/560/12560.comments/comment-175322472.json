	"body": "Thanks @mwhudson for helping un-muddle my understanding of cgo vs. internal linking vs. external linking. So to build a Go program with embedded C code (via extern \"C\") that calls functions in an external library, I need just\r\n- cgo runtime support in asm_mips64x.s\r\n- external linking support in elfreloc1\r\n\r\nbut not the internal linking support in elfsetupplt, adddynsym, adddynrela. Is that correct?\r\n",
