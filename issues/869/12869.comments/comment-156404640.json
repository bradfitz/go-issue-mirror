	"body": "@db47h regarding Publish (the last of the three questions from the original TODO), yes, the question is should it look more like Upload:\r\n\r\nhttps://godoc.org/golang.org/x/exp/shiny/screen#Uploader\r\n\r\nThat is the signature would become ```app.Publish(sender Sender)```, it would return immediately and send a message to sender when it is done. I'm not in favor of adding this kind of complexity to the method without a good reason, and I cannot see a good reason. So count me against it for now.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting question here is should we have a dedicated publish.Event type? I don't know yet.\r\n\r\nThese questions are mostly being considered in x/exp/shiny and ported to x/mobile/app, as the requirements in a multi-window system are harder.",
