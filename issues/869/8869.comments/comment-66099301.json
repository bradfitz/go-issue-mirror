I'm also not sure what it would look like. \nIf the goal is simply to provide Ticker and Timer calls for testing, I think that could\nbe done entirely independently of the time package, along the lines of the old\nplayground code.  The testing package would keep its own queue of events, and step\nforward to the next event without actually waiting.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **release-none**._",
