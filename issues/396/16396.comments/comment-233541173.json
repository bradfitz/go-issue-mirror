The other FreeBSD problems are less frequent, and I have not been able to recreate them at all.\r\n\r\nI now think this is the same as issue #13926: a problem that arises when there are many simultaneous callbacks from C to Go, which is exactly what the CgoCallbackGC test case does.  The problem is that on FreeBSD you can surprisingly large delays during the callback.  My theory is that when enough of those delays occur, the test times out.  That is consistent with the failures reported on the builder, which are in all cases the program crashing from SIGQUIT; SIGQUIT is sent by the runtime test harness when the test program runs for more than 1 minute (`runTestProg` in runtime/crash_test.go).\r\n\r\nWorking on a patch.",
