(Where exactly it ends up depends a little bit on how it's built, but it'd be somewhere under `_output`.)\r\n\r\nYou should also be able to install an \"official\" version with `gcloud components install kubectl`. I don't think the version of `kubectl` should matter for this test, though @wojtek-t or @gmarek can confirm.",
