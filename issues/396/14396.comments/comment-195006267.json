	"body": "@rsc - awesome debugging thanks!\r\n\r\nRegarding Go 1.6.0 - are those failure repeatable all the time? Because we recently (~2-3 weeks ago) fixed about that caused pod startup test failing with 1-2 minutes latencies from time to time. IIUC, you were using some old branch, so that fix may not be there.\r\nSo if it is sometime failing, sometimes passing, this is probably our bug (already fixed at head).\r\n\r\n\u003e\r\nSeparately, from looking at CPU profiles to try to understand the Go 1.5.3 delta I've identified a number of simple optimizations in the kubernetes code that would likely improve API call latency across the board. I will measure and send those once all the Go-specific stuff is done.\r\n\r\nGreat - looking forward for them and happy to review them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have one more question. From what you wrote above, it seems you don't observe any difference when changing to Go 1.4.3, right? From what I know, we were observing some differences. But I was on paternity leave the whole January, when this was observed, so this is only what I've heard. \r\nIf that's not true in your experiments, I will try to verify it again tomorrow or early next week.",
