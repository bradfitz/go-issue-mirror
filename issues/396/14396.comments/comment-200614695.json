So because `time.Now()` is based on `[__vdso_]clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, ...)` [on Linux at least], when the time changes (either due to administratively changing the system's time or due to NTP making a big adjustment or due to leap seconds) the kinds of subtractions shown above will get affected in funny ways (including potentially returning negative values), and when NTP disciplines the clock, time as measured by `time.Now()` doesn't actually pass at a constant rate.",
