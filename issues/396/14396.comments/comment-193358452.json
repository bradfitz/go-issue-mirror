	"body": "@wojtek-t, thanks for the details. I got stuck, question below. I am trying to reproduce the problem using the kubemark-guide doc you linked to earlier. I tried kubernetes v.1.8.0 since that appeared to be the latest non-alpha, non-beta release, but that git tag seems to have no test/kubemark. So now I am using dff7490, which is the revision that showed the kubemark failure going from 1.4.2 to 1.5.3.\r\n\r\nI'm stuck right after 'make quick-release'. From the guide, the next step appears to be\r\n\r\n    NUM_NODES=1000 MASTER_SIZE=n1-standard-32 ./test/kubemark/start-kubemark.sh\r\n\r\nbut I get:\r\n\r\n    $ NUM_NODES=1000 MASTER_SIZE=n1-standard-32 ./test/kubemark/start-kubemark.sh\r\n    Please install kubectl before running this script\r\n    $ \r\n\r\nWhere does 'make quick-release' write its output, and how do I unpack that output to install kubectl? Or am I supposed to be using some system version of kubernetes? Thanks.",
