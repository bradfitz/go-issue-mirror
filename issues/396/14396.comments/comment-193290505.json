And I guess it should be much easier to pin down the reason of that between those two versions than between Go 1.5.3.\r\n\r\nRegarding running kubemark - yes, it's definitely possible for you to run it.\r\nDetails explanation how to do it is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/devel/kubemark-guide.md\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need any help with that (feel free to also email me directly at wojtekt@google.com)",
