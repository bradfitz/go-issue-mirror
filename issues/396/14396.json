	"body": "The Kubernetes team found that updating from Go 1.4.2 to Go 1.4.3 caused a performance regression for them, and also that Go 1.5.3 was bad as well.\n\nThe 1.4.3 bug is kubernetes/kubernetes#17524, \"fixed\" by reverting to Go 1.4.2. The error report at the top of the bug is difficult for me to interpret: to me it says mainly that 1 != 0 and 3 != 0. [A comment](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/20400#issuecomment-178853753) on the next bug says “... but we can't do what InfluxDB did, because we have some pretty massive issues on 1.4.3. 1.4.2 was the last even vaguely happy point.” Right now, I don't have any way to quantify the 1.4.2 to 1.4.3 problem other than that remark. (The InfluxDB note is referring to #14189, but we don't know that they are necessarily related.)\n\nThe 1.5.3 bug is kubernetes/kubernetes#20400, \"fixed\" by reverting to Go 1.4.2 again. That bug has clearer data: on a particular load test, [tail latencies are significantly higher](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/20400#issuecomment-179224443) in 1.5.3.\n\nThe Kubernetes team created kubernetes/kubernetes#20656 to track further investigation of these regressions. This is the corresponding issue on the Go side.",
