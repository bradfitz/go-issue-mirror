So perhaps it is a rare bug case?\r\n\r\nSince I've managed to hit it myself once, I thought I would try and reproduce it locally with Chrome, but I can't figure out a way of generating lots of requests from Chrome with keepalives disabled. I haven't been able to hit it again with normal use. Any smart ideas there? Otherwise I might try and do it generating the requests from a go client.",
