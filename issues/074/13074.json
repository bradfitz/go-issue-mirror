	"title": "crypto/tls: Implement TLS Feature extension",
	"body": "The TLS Feature extension ([RFC 7633](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7633)) allows certificates to specify TLS features that must be used in handshakes that include the certificate. This allows implementation of \"OCSP must-staple\" which requires an OCSP response to be stapled into the handshake in order for it to be valid.\r\n\r\nThis would just be a change to client chain/handshake verification, I don't believe that any fields or methods need to be exposed.\r\n\r\n/cc @agl",
