I'm not sure what\ntriggers the failure. \n\nIt only occurs when running through the whole msgpack.Decode benchmark. All tests pass,\nbut running benchmark fails. The error occurs in the benchmark after the 92'th iteration\ni.e.\n\tfor i := 0; i \u0026lt; b.N; i++ {\n\t\tlog(\"\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; i: %v\", i)\n\t\t// \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt;\n\t}\nOnly when i=92, then I get the error. So it seems to be an issue under some kind of load.\n\nInstead of waiting till I could create a small reproducer, I decided to file it hoping\nthat something may jump out to folks familiar with the code.\n\nIf running the benchmark directly will help, you can use the following steps to\nreproduce:\n  git clone \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ugorji/go-msgpack\"\u003ehttps://github.com/ugorji/go-msgpack\u003c/a\u003e .\n  git checkout dev\n  go test -bench '_Msgpack__Decode'\n\nYou may not see the error on your first run. The second time you run it (and\nthereafter), you will.\n\nNote: The benchmark above depends on:\n\tvmsgpack \"github.com/vmihailenco/msgpack\"\n\t\"launchpad.net/mgo/bson\"\n\nYou should 'go get' these libraries. Alternatively, you can edit the benchmark_test.go\nto remove references to bson and vmsgpack.\u003c/pre\u003e",
