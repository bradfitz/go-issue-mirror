This is a common pattern needed when working with file systems and especially for cross platform use.\r\n\r\nI come from a long Ruby background, there is a great [`FileUtils`](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.1/libdoc/fileutils/rdoc/FileUtils.html) class, which implements common use cases for file/dir manipulation.\r\n\r\nThe issue above, even with `--preserve` option is implemented in pure [Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/lib/fileutils.rb#L436-L445) and cross platform compatible.\r\n\r\nIf one was to provide a PR for this functionality for go, would it be accepted?",
