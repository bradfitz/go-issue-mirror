Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n1.7.1\r\n\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nlinux amd64\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\n\r\nThe trace tool gives a 404 when trying to load trace_viewer.html\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nThe trace viewer loaded in the browser.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\nA blank page instead.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is just a package issue with arch or if its a distribution issue. If its the former I'd appreciate being pointed to where I can get the viewer file and where the tool expects to find the file on disk.\r\n\r\nI've tried reading the trace tool source but didn't see where it was hosting any static files. It appears to be serving templates only.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
