	"body": "It would be great to have an analog of \"cp -r\" for the Go standard libraries. I needed this function today for storing an archive containing a couple of nested directories, and couldn't find a ready-to-go solution that is correct wrt linux file ownership and permissions. It seems to be a common enough use case (and difficult enough to implement correctly) that it should be in the standard libraries. As it is, I ended up shelling out using os/exec - which is fine for my purposes, but not cross-platform and requires creation of another process, so it's kind of heavy-weight.",
