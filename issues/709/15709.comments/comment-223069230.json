Instead it sometimes sees a write error.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is a hidden bug here.  What seems to be happening is that the server reads some data, detects a bad certificate, sends an alert, and closes the connection.  The client seems to write some data including a bad certificate, then write some more data.  The second write fails and the client reports a write error, rather than checking for the alert sent from the server.  I think.",
