I guess you're referring to [this CL](https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/17750/) and this [new rule](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/net/http/#CloseNotifier)?:\r\n\r\n\u003e CloseNotify is undefined before Request.Body has been fully read.\r\n\r\nFor me, I get the `RequestProxy` giving `http: proxy error: net/http: request canceled` whenever there is a HTTP post; which I assume is this issue.\r\n\r\nI guess the fix is straightforward and [the call to `CloseNotify()` just needs hoisting inside RunOnFirstRead](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/http/httputil/reverseproxy.go#L153)?",
