It would be great to have that linked somewhere.\r\n\r\nIn all honesty, I think that the decision should be rethought, and it looks like I'm not the only one. The go toolchain is superb, why ship a, *imho* inferior, documentation tool? It doesn't have to be HTML or Markdown either, as long as it is possible to write better docs. If the decision changes, I would love to help with this.\r\n\r\nI regularly catch myself avoiding godoc/golang.org and jump in the code instead, because I find it hard to read and find things. This has been the cause of me overlooking important details like closing response bodies ;)",
