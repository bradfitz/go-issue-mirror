I don't seriously care clicking on the links during the development. But this is a pain for private repos without a private deployment of godoc.org.\r\n\r\n\u003e Not having lists around is a real pain. \r\n\r\n`-` prefixed lists are pretty common in the godoc from the stdlib and official package. I think they look pretty ok. Why doesn't it work?\r\n\r\n```\r\n- first item\r\n- second item\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003e No inline code.\r\n\r\nYou can escape code if you indent in godoc. Like DoSometing at https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/context. Are you mentioning another type of inlining?",
