	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe net package has a fairly complete dns implementation, however it lacks\nsupport for IPv6 (AAAA) records. The following patch adds support for this. \nIt does so by redefining A and now also AAAA as IP structs.\n\nThe pack and unpack function are modified accordingly. The unpack function works, but I\ncould not yet test the pack function. 'make test' in the net/ directory is still OK.\n\nLookupHost also needs to be modified to make IPv6 actually work. Currently it still\nlooks for A records.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/996/0/go.net.ipv6.patch\"\u003ego.net.ipv6.patch\u003c/a\u003e (5687 bytes)",
