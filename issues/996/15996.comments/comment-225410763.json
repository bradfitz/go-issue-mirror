	"body": "Interesting. I think I see what is going on here. It's not that the browser doesn't support this, it supplies it in a different way. Here is the functionality I have been expecting `document.firstElementChild`, which skips the empty Text Nodes as in the html specification. However, the net/html package only supplies the functionality of the form `document.firstChild`, which does not. \r\n\r\nGiven this realization, yes you are right to say that the package isn't malfunctioning. So in effect, this is actually a feature request rather than a bug report.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Hah, I read your example and tried it before I finished reading your post and ended up discovering the same new methods.",
