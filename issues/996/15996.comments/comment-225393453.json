You can test this with a simpler version of the html, with some whitespace before the last section tag, which becomes the last child node:\r\n\r\n`\u003csection\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003c/section\u003e`\r\n\r\nAdding a test for section.LastChild.Type to your example shows it is of type TextNode (either with this simpler html or with your example). Removing the whitespace from your example means it works as you expect.\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/uGfE2LTsjg\r\n\r\nSo I don't think this is a bug?",
