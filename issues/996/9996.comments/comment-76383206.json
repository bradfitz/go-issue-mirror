	"body": "I also found that godoc reindexes every 5 minutes, displaying \"Indexing in progress: result may be inaccurate\" again. It seems that setting Corpus.IndexInterval to -1 would stop the reindexing (with tipgodoc a new instance is started on a change anyway), but there doesn't seem to be a way to control that value from outside. \r\n\r\nCoincidentally I've never encountered this message on golang.org; is it running a modified version? In that case it would seem to be the easiest to do whatever golang.org does. Otherwise, would adding an environment variable make sense? (I imagine adding a command line flag would complicate the user interface for little benefit, and according to the comment at https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/264bffc00c400ce4401cc2be15ed56e18a12e889/godoc/index.go#L1544 this may become unnecessary in case it is changed to use fsnotify in the future.)\r\n\r\nAlthough even with reindexing running every now and then, I'd consider it to be an improvement over the current situation of no search.",
