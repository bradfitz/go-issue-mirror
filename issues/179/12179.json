	"body": "The various assembly tables and the like do not belong in rsc.io/.... At the time I created rsc.io/x86 there were details of the subrepo story still up in the air, but that was never intended to be the final location. All the code there went through the usual code review processes, because we knew parts of it were going into the main distribution.\r\n\r\nI propose to create a golang.org/x/arch subrepo that will have top-level directories x86, ppc64, arm, arm64, and so on, to hold the table extractors, table generators, and table users (disassemblers, maybe later assemblers and other tools).\r\n\r\nWe will still vendor the disassemblers into the main repo for use by cmd/objdump, but golang.org/x/arch will be the source of truth instead of rsc.io.\r\n\r\n/cc @robpike @adg @minux @aramh @ianlancetaylor \r\n\r\nEdit: updated to mention code review and reformat.",
