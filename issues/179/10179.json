	"body": "In Go 1.4, we have https://golang.org/cmd/ld, which is the overall docs for the linkers,\r\nafter the c2go transition, we no longer have that page.\r\nAnd https://tip.golang.org/cmd/internal/ld/ shows the package document, not the\r\ncommand document. And https://tip.golang.org/cmd/6l doesn't show anything.\r\n\r\nWe should decide whether we want to release the old linkers, or just replace them with\r\ncmd/link. And restore the docs if we still release the old linkers.\r\n\r\n(I think we should release the old linkers, just in case there are some unknown problems\r\nwith the new linker.)\r\n\r\n@rsc, what's your plan for the new linker?",
