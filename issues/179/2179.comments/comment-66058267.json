Specifically, in the ServeCodec method in pkg/rpc/server.go, the loop only\nbreaks if the error is os.EOF or io.ErrUnexpectedEOF.  If it is any other error, the\nloop continues and tries again.  If the server returns the same error over and over\nagain, then the loop continues forever.\nThis is trivially reproducable on Windows using the standard RPC calls (not json RPC)\nbecause a closed socket doesn't return EOF on Windows.\u003c/pre\u003e",
