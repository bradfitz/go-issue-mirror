	"body": "Currently the GC doesn't always wake up idle Ps, and hence may not take full advantage of idle marking during the concurrent mark phase. This can happen during mark 2 because mark 1 completion preempts all workers; if the Ps running those workers have nothing else to do they will simply park, and there's no mechanism to wake them up after we allow mark workers to start again. It's possible this can happen during mark 1 as well, though it may be since we allow mark workers to run before starting the world for mark 1 that all of the Ps start running.\r\n\r\n/cc @RLH ",
