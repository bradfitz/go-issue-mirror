Go shouldn't be sending\nan empty NPN extension when NextProtos is nil, but that's not a big deal.\n\nThe real problem is that, in the event of a mismatch, Firefox is defaulting to sending\nan NextProtocol of spdy/3, but actually talking HTTP/1.1! I've made a note and will\nchase up the FF folks on Monday. I'll also fix the Go issue and that should solve it too.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-soon**, **go1.1.1**, **packagebug**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to @agl._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
