But, on\nthe other hand, all current uses of ECDH in the Go code are ephemeral so picking a\ndifferent curve isn't useful for an attacker.\n\nSo I can't prescribe a validation that's sufficient and minimal for everyone. At this\nlevel of the code, some understanding is required.\n\nHigher-level, friendly APIs are implemented in go.crypto/nacl/box.\u003c/pre\u003e",
