	"body": "For background see discussion at https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/Uet5p_3JhZs/discussion\r\n\r\nCurrently it is possible to determine the offset between two values' addresses by finding the difference between uintptrs converted from unsafe.Pointer values. This is the only way to be able to determine whether two slices overlap in memory since the advent of three index slicing and the only way to determine in less than linear time whether blocked sparse slices overlap (relevant for views in constructed 2D slices for e.g. BLAS operations). In the event that a moving GC is implemented this may no longer be safe; if a GC move occurs between taking the conversion to uintptr of address of the first and second values, the offset may be incorrect. Note that the GC move does not otherwise invalidate the offset between overlapping slices or falsely result in non-overlapping being construed as overlapping.",
