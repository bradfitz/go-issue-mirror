	"body": "This should be easier than #14587, as we don't have to deal with flags.  You'd just need to make sure there are no other uses of the load.  Then it would just be a simple rewrite.\r\nThe challenge is just the bulk of it.  You'd want all the possible addressing modes, plus all the ops (ADD, SUB, AND...).  In addition, this is something that only x86 can do, all the other archs are load-store architectures which can't do this.\r\nI'm leaning toward punting on this for now.  When the SSA backend gets more mature we can revisit.\r\n",
