It's wildcards vs not.\nIf you say go build \u003cdir\u003e, it resolves dir to its real value before continuing.\nIf you say go list ... it lists all known canonical paths.\n\nI don't believe your example. I think it would show $GOPATH/src/foo as foo.\nTo make your example work you'd need to give the true $GOPATH dir a different name.\n\nSymlinks cause all manner of weird behavior. It's best not to use them at all.\n\nNo intention to fix this, since I don't see what there is to fix.",
