The issue\nis not urgent and it already has a workaround (add an extra space to the comment), so\nI'm not waiting for it to be fixed. (If it is urgent I would rather fix it myself and\nsubmit a patch).\n\nI posted the issue because I think it might be interesting to understand what exact \"go\ncover\" does with the comments with special format \"//line xxx\", if one of the authors of\n\"go cover\" happens to see and answer it.\n\nI'm sorry for my impatience. The issue is simple and obvious if you actually run it.\nMore words just don't help.\u003c/pre\u003e",
