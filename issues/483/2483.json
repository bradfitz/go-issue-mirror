	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hg update default\u0026quot;, rebuild, and\nretry\nwhat you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n- If I am watching a directory, and delete it, and recreate it, \n  and watch it again, any events after that are hosed:\n  - the event.Name is incomplete, with the path stripped out e.g. \n    instead of /home/myname/a/b/c/d.txt, I get /d.txt\n    instead of /home/myname/a/b/c/, I get \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n  - RemoveWatch fails with message: invalid argument\n  - Close() doesn't really close. Most times, the reader goroutine hangs.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nUbuntu Linux 2.6.38-12-generic #51-Ubuntu SMP 32-bit GNU/Linux\n\nWhich revision are you using?
