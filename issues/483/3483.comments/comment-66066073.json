I want to be in control of the whole\ntoolchain, from assembler through C to golang, not only in control of golang. Entire\nidea of this makefile replacement seems incomplete.\n\nAlso, this \"// +build ignore\" thing is very counterintuitive. Main module should be\nignored during the build or whatever?\n\nFor now, we'll stick with bitpatch of string literal inside 8g.exe.\u003c/pre\u003e",
