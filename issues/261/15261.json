	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\nWhatever golang.org is using behind the scenes to run examples, as of 2016-4-12 ~5pm CT.\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nSame as 1.\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nRan the example code here: https://golang.org/pkg/go/types/#example_MethodSet\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI expected the program to \"Print the method sets of Celsius and *Celsius.\" as documented.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nAn error:\r\n\u003e 2009/11/10 23:00:00 celsius.go:3:8: could not import fmt (can't find import: )\r\n\r\nThe error is returned from this call:\r\n\u003e pkg, err := conf.Check(\"temperature\", fset, []*ast.File{f}, nil)\r\n\r\n\r\n~~Since this example does not specify its expected output (// Output:), this failure will not be registered via go test.~~ Edit: the source files have // Output:, so it's not clear to me what is happening.\r\n\r\nI'm new to go/types, so it's not clear to me whether the example is broken, or packages are broken.",
