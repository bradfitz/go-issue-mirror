Doing MtE/M\u0026E CBC correctly is very hard and\nwe would undoubtedly end up with some \"I hope it's good enough\" implementation, thus\nperpetuating the cycle of crypto-nonsense. Implementations capable of EtM CBC will also\nbe capable of CTR mode I believe.\n\n(The same argument applies to TLS where we don't implement MtE CBC correctly either. I'd\nlove to get rid of CBC mode there also, but the compatibility situation is sadly very\ndifferent with TLS.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
