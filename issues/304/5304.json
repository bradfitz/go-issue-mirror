	"body": "by **kodafox**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Put a build constraint comment at top of a file \u0026quot;// +build ignore\u0026quot;\n2. Put the package statement on *the next line* \u0026quot;package my_package\u0026quot;\n3. Put an init function in the file that should be ignored, so that it's easy to see\nthat it was built into the package erroneously.\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe file should not be built into the package.\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe file is built into the package.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nOS X 10.8.3\n\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo1.0.3\n\n\nWorkaround:\nAdding an empty line in between the build constraint comment and the package statement\nis an easy workaround.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5304/0/main.go\"\u003emain.go\u003c/a\u003e (119 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5304/0/mainignore.go\"\u003emainignore.go\u003c/a\u003e (228 bytes)",
