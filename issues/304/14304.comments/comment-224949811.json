	"body": "I started implementing this this week. I don't think we should put both the benchmarks and the tools in a single repository because their audiences are different. The benchmarks are for performance analysis *of the Go core* and are only useful to Go core developers. The tools, however, have a much wider audience, since they're useful for anyone using benchmarks in Go.\r\n\r\nThis suggests that we should 1) leave the benchmarks in their own repository, which might as well continue to be x/benchmarks, and 2) either create a new subrepo for performance tools and packages or put these in the x/tools repository. For 2, I don't have a strong opinion whether we create a new subrepo or use x/tools, except that x/tools is already a grab bag.\r\n\r\nI think creating x/perfdata still makes sense. And we should still modify the existing benchmarks to produce standard benchmark output and probably convert them to separate binaries for better modularity (I have several other benchmarks it would make sense to put in there, but that don't make sense to add to the existing monolithic binary).\r\n\r\n/cc @adg @quentinmit",
