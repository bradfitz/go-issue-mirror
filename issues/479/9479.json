Alternate installation instructions are available on the github.com/gonum/blas README.md.  The important thing is that I'm running the cover tool's html option with a package that uses cgo.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to see?\r\nI expected 16% of the lines of code to show green, consistent with the test tool's coverage report.  \r\n\r\nWhat did you see instead?\r\nOnly a 3 lines were highlighted green, and there were hundreds of lines colored red.\r\n![screen shot 2014-12-30 at 10 29 04 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4468162/5585284/bda4c0a6-9074-11e4-9182-fe2be6d4a99c.png)\r\n\r\nThe issue https://github.com/golang/go/issues/6333 seems to be related.  That one appears to be focused on the command line tool, which is working correctly in this case (I think).  The html report is not.",
