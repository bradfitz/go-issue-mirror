	"body": "`http.Header` is using many methods from `textproto.MIMEHeader` (see https://golang.org/src/net/http/header.go), but `textproto.MIMEHeader` is missing a `Write` method. This method is implemented in `net/http`. It seems weird to import `net/http` each time a `textproto.MIMEHeader` needs to be formatted. The `Write` method could instead be moved to `net/textproto`, and called in `net/http` as it's done for several other functions.",
