Only the\nEBNF is sometimes inexact (simplified). This simplification makes the EBNF more\ncomprehensible, even though only structurally valid (exact). Where the EBNF is not\nexact, the surrounding text specifies the exact rules. It's the same as e.g. any other\nconstraints/limitations, which are not at all expressible by EBNF (scope redeclaration\nfor example, type compatibility, number limits, ...).\u003c/pre\u003e",
