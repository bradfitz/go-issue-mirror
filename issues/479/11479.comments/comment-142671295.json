The other dot-actions translate to local HTML elements, while something like this modifies the document globally (the body tag, all pre tags, css, etc.).\r\n\r\nI ended up writing some javascript I included with `.html rtl.html` that achieves the desired effect. rtl.html is at https://gist.github.com/saljam/a97beee492aab6b66483\r\n\r\nThat's good enough for me, so I'm happy if this issue is closed now. If you think it's worth it, I can submit a CL that adds a `.rtl` action which just translates to that javascript tag.",
