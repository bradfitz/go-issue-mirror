What you have provided is not runnable.\r\n\r\nWith that said, you are ignoring the error from json decode, which if it fails will probably leave job_temp undefined. I'm guessing your program crashes at the switch on job_temp.RequestMethod.\r\n\r\nThe rest of your program is also ignoring any error checking. You must check each and every error if you want to want to use the result from an operation that can possibly return an error.\r\n\r\nI am going to close this error as there is no bug to be fixed. We do not use the issue tracker for general discussion, I recommend you ask your question in another forum, see https://golang.org/wiki/Questions.\r\n",
