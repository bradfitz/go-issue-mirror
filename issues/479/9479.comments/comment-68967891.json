	"body": "The problem here is that the line and column numbers in the cover profile refer to the cgo-rewritten file, but the file named is the original Go source file. For this particular case, a profile line refers to column 157 of line 91 of blas.go, whereas the actual data for that counter comes from 157 of line 91 of blas.cgo1.go. Line 91 of blas.go has only 122 characters; the cgo rewrite lengthens the line.\r\n\r\nWhen the HTML processor for the cover tool reads, as instructed, blas.go, line 91 has only 122 characters but the block termination is written to happen at column 157. The tool decides the block never terminates, and the HTML output is compromised.\r\n\r\nWe are fixing the cover tool to terminate the block at the end of the line so the rest of the file will work. This is a simple fix, but not fully correct: the column numbers for blocks that start or stop on all rewritten lines will be incorrect. They always were, for cgo files.\r\n\r\nA real fix will require much more complex computation to refer the column numbers back to the original Go source file, which is the one that the HMTL annotation refers to. This is not impossible, but it's close to infeasible.\r\n\r\nWe will leave this bug open to record this possibility, but don't expect it to be fixed. The updated cover tool will at least not fail so badly. Only the column numbers will sometimes be wrong. Lines will always be right.",
