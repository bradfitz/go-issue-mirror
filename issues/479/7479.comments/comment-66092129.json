From the thread it looks\nlike the big spanners you can throw in are:\n\n * Your app is a GUI/full-fledge Win32 app (this requires a flag to the go linker).\n * You're invoking other Win32 APIs such as service-related and event-loop related stuff.\n\nNone of the above were true in my testing.\n\nThe patch you want is \u003ca href=\"https://codereview.appspot.com/download/issue71900043_40001.diff\"\u003ehttps://codereview.appspot.com/download/issue71900043_40001.diff\u003c/a\u003e\n\nYour gist generates SIGINT for CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT which isn't optimal, the patch generates\nSIGTERM for reasons given in the source. Either way you must also catch the signal with\nos.Notify. There's a test program here:\n\u003ca href=\"https://bitbucket.org/anacrolix/dms/src/8d6ab94e3c8032d11b870867609ba9dd618e79fc/play/termsig/?at=default\"\u003ehttps://bitbucket.org/anacrolix/dms/src/8d6ab94e3c8032d11b870867609ba9dd618e79fc/play/termsig/?at=default\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIf you pipe the output to a file from a terminal, and then close the terminal you should\nsee the termination signal in the file.\u003c/pre\u003e",
