	"body": "The `present` tool is currently unusable with right-to-left scripts. Text is left-aligned, and punctuation and English words appear at the wrong end of sentences (see screenshot). This can be fixed by setting the right HTML attributes.\r\n\r\nCurrent output for a slide with Arabic text:\r\n![screen shot 2015-06-30 at 02 10 02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/751023/8420632/3eb8a978-1ecd-11e5-814d-8aa398d4ff5e.png)\r\n\r\nExpected output:\r\n![screen shot 2015-06-30 at 02 08 28](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/751023/8420638/4c3ae03e-1ecd-11e5-803e-a7ff3c3dc193.png)\r\n\r\nAdding RTL support would enable slides to be written in Arabic (incl. Farsi \u0026 Urdu) and Hebrew\r\n\r\nI would implement this by adding a function (e.g. \".rtl\") that when invoked would set the RTL mode for the entire presentation. The effects of this would be:\r\n- add the \"dir=rtl\" attribute to the `\u003cbody\u003e` tag.\r\n- add \"dir=ltr\" to all `\u003cpre\u003e` tags so code remains correctly formatted.\r\n- invert the slide switch animation so that the \"next\" slide is on the left and the \"past\" slide is on the right.\r\n\r\nAdding a special function to set a rarely used mode isn't ideal. I'm open to suggestions of alternatives. Automatically setting it based on the language of the first word might work but isn't \"least-surprise\".",
