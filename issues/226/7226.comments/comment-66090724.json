If $GOROOT/pkg/linux_amd64_race exists, go install -race std doesn't\noverwrite $GOROOT/bin/gofmt, so users of the binary distribution aren't affected. If it\ndoesn't, gofmt is replaced by a race-enabled one.\n\nOther than hacking on the go tool, maybe do this:\n\nThere was an issue somewhere to add a function to runtime to tell if the race detector\nis on. If that exists yet, maybe gofmt can just print a warning to stderr:\n\n\"gofmt is built with the race detector enabled and will be slow\".\n\nAlternatively, you could add a +build race file to do this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
