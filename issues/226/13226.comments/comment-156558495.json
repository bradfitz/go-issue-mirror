	"body": "I agree @natefinch that we should have a policy, and that it should be easily findable by people browsing the wiki.  I do keep an eye on the changelogs, and have only had to rollback one commit (someone accidentally added a new file), so I'm not too concerned with abuse.\r\n\r\nHow about this for a policy:\r\n\r\n* Anyone logged into their GitHub account can submit edits to the contents of the Go Wiki.\r\n* If you would like to add a new page, please first open an issue in the golang/go/issues tracker with prefix 'wiki' to propose the addition. Clearly state why the content doesn't fit into any of the existing pages.\r\n* Because renaming of pages in the wiki can break external links, please open an issue before renaming or removing any wiki page.\r\n\r\nOnce we have a finalized version of a policy, I can add it to the head/foot of the Home.md page.",
