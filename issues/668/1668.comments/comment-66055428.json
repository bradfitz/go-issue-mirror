Stu originally wanted only Makefile but people objected to the upper-case letter\nand so the compromise was made.  The road to hell is paved with compromise.\n\nGo uses Makefile.  I originally added a check for both, but then the question arises\nwhether to check for all the possible names (there are others!) or just say, Go uses\nMakefile.\n\nGo uses Makefile.\n\nCC'ing rsc, who talked me (easily) into checking only for Makefile.\n\nI could resurrect the check for lower case, but I'd feel unclean about it.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
