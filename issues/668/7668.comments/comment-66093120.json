More I see this issue,\nmore I feel the spec is wrong or pointless at least.\n\nFor example, in order to include DEL character in a quoted string, one needs to add a\nbackslash before the DEL. But the DEL is transmitted as-is. And, of course, DEL cannot\nbe confused with closing '\"'. So what's the point of adding a backslash before the DEL?\n\nIt's getting seem like a corner case that even the spec doesn't handle that correctly.\nI'm leaning to leave it alone.\u003c/pre\u003e",
