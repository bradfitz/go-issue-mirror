Set up two GOROOT entries, put packages in each, and run a test of the\n    package that depends on the other one, as follows:\n    \n        export GOPATH=`pwd`/tmp/path1:`pwd`/tmp/path2\n        mkdir -p tmp/path1/src/foo tmp/path2/src/bar\n        \n        cp foo.go tmp/path1/src/foo/\n        cp bar.go tmp/path2/src/bar/\n        cp bar_test.go tmp/path2/src/bar/\n        \n        go install foo\n        go test bar\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nThe test should pass.\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nThe test fails to link, with an error about not being able to find the\ndependency under $GOROOT:\n\n    $ go test bar\n    # cd $WORK/bar/_test\n    6l -o ./test.out -L /Users/jacobsa/tmp/path2/pkg/darwin_amd64 -L . -L $WORK ./main.a\n    cannot open file: /Users/jacobsa/go/root/pkg/darwin_amd64/foo.a\n    FAIL\tbar [build failed]\n    \n    $ echo $GOROOT\n    /Users/jacobsa/go/root\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nOS X 10.7\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\n866eb939e61f tip\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nAs I understand the gopath docs, this case should work. bar depends on foo,\nbut foo is installed locally under the first GOPATH entry. It looks like the\n'go' command is not finding foo because it's in a different GOPATH entry from\nbar.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2668/0/foo.go\"\u003efoo.go\u003c/a\u003e (36 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2668/0/bar.go\"\u003ebar.go\u003c/a\u003e (74 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2668/0/bar_test.go\"\u003ebar_test.go\u003c/a\u003e (156 bytes)",
