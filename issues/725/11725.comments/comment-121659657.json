	"body": "Thanks.  Here is what I think is happening:\r\n\r\nYou invoke go build with \"-o PATH/run0go\".  The go command passed that -o option directly to the linker.  The linker opened that exact file name as the output file, without appending \".exe\".  The linker saw this was a cgo build, and decided to invoke the external linker.  The Go linker closed the output file (PATH/run0go) but did not remove it.  The Go linker passed the same -o option to the external linker.  The external linker, being a regular Windows linker, appended \".exe\".  That created run0go.exe.  The empty run0go file was created by the Go linker and never removed.",
