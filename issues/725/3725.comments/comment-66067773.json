Hence \nI tried to design the ETL tools with Go. Then I found sometimes the Go programs ran not\nso fast as JAVA programs. That made me very disappointed and tried to find why. I really\ntried to use the appendInt or appendFloat, but when one row contains too many int or\nfloat, the data process still slowly(comparing to JAVA). \n\nIf there are no good solutions for this issue, you can pass this issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
