	"body": "@crawshaw The crash problem is not a go problem but based on what I have read, really bad webview code in several versions of android in which the webview is misusing a signal handler which results in the current \"fix\" in the wild where if you are using jni lib, it is best to force webview to load first, then the regular libs. @dskinner's crash might also be caused by webview since the google ad itself is a wrapped in a webview.\r\n\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=476831\r\n\r\nBased on our own experience, the scope of the problem is wider than just the bug above. \r\n\r\n1) There is nothing wrong with Go generated code or Go code itself.\r\n2) But if we use Go generated code, there will be lots of random crashes if any jni/library is used along with webview.\r\n\r\nNot sure what the best way to go about this but to give user the option to manually bind the context at their choosing instead of auto-binding at a random access point in which the first go code is executed.
