Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. The language definition mentions \u0026quot;infinity\u0026quot; once in a rounding context.\n2. The word \u0026quot;special\u0026quot; shows up a few times, never in float[32|64] context.\n3. Hence it seems that [-]infinity and Nan are not accessible from Go.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nn/a\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nn/a\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nb0524afd0d7c tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nOpenAL allows [-]infinity in a few places, so it would be nice to have it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
