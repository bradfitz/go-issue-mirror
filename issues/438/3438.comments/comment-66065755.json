Once you\ncan write\n    b = a.(type)\nit becomes very tempting to write\n    var v1 b\n    v2 := b(0)\n    m := map[b]b{}\nThen we have to think about global variables with dynamic types.  It's a very complex\nchange.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **languagechange**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
