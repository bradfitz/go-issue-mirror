So if you fix this, I'd prefer if you went out of your way to special case the `%2F` path with extra comments and keep the old path (even if it's redundant) just so people can read and see what the obvious way is, and why the `%2F` way is the more ugly \u0026 hard-to-read case.\r\n\r\nYou want to do this, @minux?\r\n",
