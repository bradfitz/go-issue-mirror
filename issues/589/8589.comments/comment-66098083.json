We decided\nthat for structs it's better to have to mention the types of the individual fields\nbecause they are probably not all the same and thus it would be harder to read such\ncomposite literals (except for the special cases where there's perhaps only one or two\nfields). And we decided that well aware that if we wanted to, we could permit and it\nwould be backward-compatible.\n\nIt's a conservative stance, but it has served us well so far. Call it a \"deliberate\ninconsistency\".\n\nThis issue is about making the rules for map composites symmetric, for both keys and\nvalues. This is in the spirit of the current approach, and is simply an oversight.\u003c/pre\u003e",
