	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n1.7 beta 2\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nLinux.\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nRan the tests under a new-ish version of sbuild, which prevents writing to $HOME by setting it to /sbuild-nonexistent.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nThe tests pass.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nThey failed like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--- FAIL: TestCgoPprof (1.39s)\r\n\tcrash_cgo_test.go:256: failed to access temp dir /sbuild-nonexistent/pprof: mkdir /sbuild-nonexistent: permission denied\r\n\tcrash_cgo_test.go:258: exit status 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere a few ways this could be fixed I guess (only create that directory when it is about to be written into?) but the simplest would I think be to set PPROF_TMPDIR to TMPDIR (or /tmp) in the tests.",
