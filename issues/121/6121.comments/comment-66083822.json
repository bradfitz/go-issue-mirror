Running a MITM HTTPS proxy, I\nget a lot of errors related to ECDHE_ECDSA when Chrome connects to Google sites through\nmy proxy. The problem seems to be that somehow a cipher suite using ECDSA is being\nchosen even though my server certificate has an RSA private keyâ€”and therefore it can't\ndo ECDSA.\n\nIf I disable the ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suites in  crypto/tls/cipher_suites.go, the errors\ngo away. But the real solution would be for the function that picks the cipher suite to\ntake the type of server certificate into account.\u003c/pre\u003e",
