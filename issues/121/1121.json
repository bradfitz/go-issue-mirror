	"body": "by **seth.bunce**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eProposal: Go should ignore the first line of a program if it begins with \u0026quot;#!\u0026quot;.\n\nPrecedent: The D programming language does this. (under Phases of Compilation step 2)\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/lex.html\"\u003ehttp://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/lex.html\u003c/a\u003e\n\nRationale: This would allow go programs to specify runners like shell scripts do.\n\nCost vs Benefit: Existing Go programs would not have to be modified. This capability\ncould be useful to some. Very low cost, low (maybe moderate) benefit.\u003c/pre\u003e",
