	"body": "Usually, when a user has sent a request to a server, and the request is running from a too long time, the user can send a \"cancel\" command by sending an out-of-band data to the server.\r\n\r\nThe server can then immediately take the appropriate measure.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to add a method to net.TCPConn, that would call the C function \"send(..., MSG_OOB)\" ?\r\n",
