	"title": "net/http: remove support for continuation lines in header parsing",
	"body": "Apparently HTTP gave up on some old loose parsing rules at some point and got stricter. The spec now says that HTTP field continuation lines (those starting with a space or tab) like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/2MmjLz7eqg\r\n```\r\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\nFoo: bar\r\n and a continuation line\r\nAnother: this one without\r\n```\r\n\r\n... are illegal now, per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.4:\r\n\r\n\u003e    Historically, HTTP header field values could be extended over\r\n\u003e   multiple lines by preceding each extra line with at least one space\r\n\u003e  or horizontal tab (obs-fold).  This specification deprecates such\r\n\u003e  line folding except within the message/http media type\r\n\u003e   (Section 8.3.1).  A sender MUST NOT generate a message that includes\r\n\u003e   line folding (i.e., that has any field-value that contains a match to\r\n\u003e   the obs-fold rule) unless the message is intended for packaging\r\n\u003e   within the message/http media type.\r\n\r\nLikewise in that section, space before colon is disallowed now, which we accept: http://play.golang.org/p/hCA3o7q-tb\r\n\r\n",
