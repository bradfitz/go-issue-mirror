That is, all comments that declare an exported item\nstay with that item. So if that (group of) comments contains a TODO, BUG, etc. that part\nof the comment is simply untouched and shown with the comment.\n\nAll otherwise discarded comments are then searched for notes, which are always shown\nseparately and collectively. There is no association with any specific entity. There is\nno difference between notes inside function and notes on the package level as long as\nthe latter are \"free-floating\", i.e., not associated with any declaration documentation.\u003c/pre\u003e",
