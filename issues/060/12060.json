	"body": "From https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.5 --\r\n\r\n\u003e The WaitGroup function in package sync now diagnoses code that races a call to Add against a return from Wait. If it detects this condition, WaitGroup panics.\r\n\r\n`WaitGroup` is a type, not a function.  In looking at the race-related code in the `WaitGroup.Add()` and `WaitGroup.Wait()` methods, I think this line in the docs is supposed to read more like:\r\n\r\n\u003e sync.WaitGroup's Add method now diagnoses code that races a call to Add against a return from Wait. If it detects this condition, Add panics.",
