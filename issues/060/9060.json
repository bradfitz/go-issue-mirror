	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eAt the moment, method expressions must be of the form T.m or (*T).m . There's no reason\nto generalize the notation to T.m where T is any kind of type that has a method m. The\nonly options are the ones we already have, as well as unnamed interface types and struct\ntype embedding fields with methods.\n\nThese extra cases are largely academic but there's no real reason for the restriction;\nit only adds complexity to the spec and requires extra checks in the compiler.\n\nThis would be a backward-compatible language change w/o impact to users. It would\nsimplify the spec. It simplifies the type-checker. It may simplify the rest of the\nimplementation.\n\nSee also \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/8605\"\u003eissue #8605\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e",
