	"body": "This requires more subtle changes in the spec than anticipated - simply removing the grammar in https://golang.org/ref/spec#Method_expressions and replacing MethodExpression with Type in Operand may do it, but then warrant more simplifications (regarding composite literals). Too subtle to squeeze in before 1.7. Still, would be nice to fix since cmd/compile and go/types seem to accept it effortlessly, and it's a clean generalization.\r\n\r\nBut esoteric and of no real use for now, so no urgency. Postponing again.",
