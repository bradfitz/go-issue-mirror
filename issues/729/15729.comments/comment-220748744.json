I used your exactly playground code, but I substituted a 65536 byte constant (using `\"a\"*65536` in python). I still can't reproduce.\r\n\r\nI ran:\r\n\r\n``bash\r\n$ go build foo.go \u0026\u0026 ls -l foo\r\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 josh  staff  1162496 May 20 17:41 foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I uncommented the three lines and ran:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ go build foo.go \u0026\u0026 ls -l foo\r\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 josh  staff  1162496 May 20 17:42 foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, the symbols called `main.hdr..gostring.1` are no longer produced at tip. Please see the linked CL; they are instead given content-addressable names and end up in the generic `go.string.*` symbol, where their individual names are not visible.\r\n\r\nThe fact that you are seeing `main.hdr..gostring.1` in your nm output says to me that you're accidentally using an old (e.g. 1.6) compiler. Would you mind double-checking? Thanks.\r\n",
