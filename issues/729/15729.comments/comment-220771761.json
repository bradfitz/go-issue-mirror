	"body": "Yeah, my mistake was to leave my existing Go installation (1.6) as it was, clone tip into a different directory and run `all.bash`, which put the newer `go` tool in my GOBIN, but hadn't affected anything else, so it was still using the old subtools. I blew away my old tooling and moved tip there, re-ran `all.bash`, and it worked as expected.\r\n\r\nI agree that I shouldn't have set GOROOT; it was a hangover from when I was trying to get GoSublime to work nicely.",
