	"body": "Proposal feature enhancement for discussion:\r\n\r\nProposal is to add two new flags: '_test.list_' and '_test.listbench_'.  When executed from the test binary it will list all tests (including examples with output set) or benches\r\n\r\nThe tests will be printed to stdout with one test per line and then exit with a exit code of 0.  No tests would be ran or any other operation.  It would be nice to include maybe some filering, but it's not nessisary for my use case.  This would probably be easiest just be added at the top of M.Run()\r\n\r\nUse case.  We have a custom test runner that unifies all languages test output and part of the procedure is test discovery.  Right there is isn't a great way to get a list of tests that are included in a test binary.\r\n\r\nNot included in this feature enhancement is any modifications to the 'go test' tool to map through the setting .\r\n",
