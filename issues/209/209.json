If you for example look at the\npython library it is in some places very inconsistent in coding standards\nand behavior. A good \u0026quot;standard\u0026quot; library is the recipe for success of a\nlanguage. If this process also covers the language is another question but\nthat would probably be a good idea.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://jcp.org/en/home/index\"\u003ehttp://jcp.org/en/home/index\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps\"\u003ehttp://www.python.org/dev/peps\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
