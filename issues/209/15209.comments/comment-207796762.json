	"body": "This will require allocating a slice under the covers. []int and []interface{} do not have the same memory and unless something magic happens, the only way to achieve this is to allocate the []interface slice and run the loop. In other words, except for microoptimizations this must do what the current user-written code does, and involves an allocation and an O(len(slice)) copy.\r\n\r\nI am not making an argument for or against, just saying something that should appear in the proposal.",
