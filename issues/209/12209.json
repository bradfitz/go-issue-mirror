	"body": "@crawshaw @hyangah @rakyll @nigeltao\r\nAs Go is high-performant system-level programming language, that also gained fast garbage collector in latest 1.5 release, it can become a perfect choice for game development. There are many OpenGL ES 2 emulation layers for Windows, for example Google's open-source [ANGLE](code.google.com/p/angleproject/), [AMD library](http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/graphics-development/amd-opengl-es-sdk/) and others. It would be great if `golang.org/x/mobile/...` packages were implemented for this OS aside of Mac OS X, as it is probably most popular operating system among game developers. This would be big step to Go promotion, because it would enable large gamedev community to easily develop (cross-platform) games in Go.\r\n\r\nYes, now one can build apps and launch them on real device, but such workflow is unusable because of very long build time (compile -\u003e zip -\u003e sign -\u003e upload to device -\u003e wait until installation complete). All game engines and frameworks use this scheme with desktop emulation.\r\n\r\nI personally ask for this because I chose Go as language for developing my Android game, but after investigation I decided to work on my own OpenGL binding and other mobile code. Hope this will be considered. Thanks",
