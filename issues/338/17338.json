	"body": "I would like to ask if it's possible to move package `internal/singleflight` to `sync/singleflight` for Go1.8?\r\n\r\nI've searched the issues and there is already a proposal to move `internal/singleflight` into `x/sync` =\u003e https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13058 but it never happend. I would love to see it in `sync/singleflight` instead of `x/sync`. I'm using singleflight nowadays as a copy in my repos like others also copied it. If OK, I can send a CL on Gerrit for the move to `sync/singleflight`.\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n`go version devel +79db162 Fri Sep 30 05:15:19 2016 +0000 darwin/amd64`\r\n\r\n",
