The issue is with the construction of GOTOOLDIR where the space is used\nverbatim as in C:\\go \\pkg\\tool\\windows_386 and the path will never be valid.    \n\nI guess it depends on how \"forgiving\" you want go to be. You're essentially arguing that\ngo should be so unforgiving that it doesn't even understand the quirks of the underlying\nOS/environment it runs on.   \n\nSo we get into a situation of shifting the responsibility of understanding Windows and\nits quirks from the go team onto the end users themselves. It really isn't that rare for\nusers to set environment variables in BAT or even using the dialog, both of which\nsupport quotes and extra spaces/whitespace.   \n\nOnly Powershell is likely not going to introduce these issues...\u003c/pre\u003e",
