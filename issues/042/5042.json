	"body": "by **jgodfrey@thelostsite.co.uk**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThis is a Windows specific issue. GOTOOLDIR is being incorrectly constructed.   \n\n Reproduction:   \n1. Set GOROOT using the SET command (BAT file), enclosing it in quotes (E.g.\n\u0026quot;C:\\Program Files\\go\u0026quot;). As in:\nSET GOROOT=\u0026quot;C:\\Program Files\\go\u0026quot;     \n2. Leave GOTOOLDIR undefined   \n3. Run \u0026quot;go env\u0026quot; or attempt to build anything which requires GOTOOLDIR \n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n\u0026quot;go env\u0026quot; should output: \nset GOTOOLDIR=\u0026quot;C:\\Program Files\\go\\pkg\\tool\\windows_386\u0026quot;\n\nOr: \nset GOTOOLDIR=C:\\Program Files\\go\\pkg\\tool\\windows_386     \n\nWith or without the quotes should be equivalent. \n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nset GOTOOLDIR=\u0026quot;C:\\Program Files\\go\u0026quot;\\pkg\\tool\\windows_386\n\nIt appears to take the literal variable, including quotation marks, and add\n\u0026quot;\\pkg\\tool\\windows_386\u0026quot; to the end. This both shows up incorrectly in go env\nand also stops using from compiling since no packages will ever be found.    \n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nWindows 7    \n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo version go1.0.3 \n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThis is arguably Windows' own fault for the way it handles SET values. However it is\nfairly common to quote paths with spaces in them (e.g. \u0026quot;Program Files\u0026quot; etc) so\nI can foresee this being a problem in the future if quotes aren't \u0026quot;considered.\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e",
