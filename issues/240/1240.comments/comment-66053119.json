Then dump the memory:\n\n   x/6xb 0xaddress-printed-by-foo\n   x/6xb 0xaddress-printed-by-bar\n\nMy guess is that something else is using the same memory\nfor another purpose, but I have no idea what or why we\ndon't see it on other systems.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **HelpWanted**._",
