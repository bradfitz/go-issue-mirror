With APIs like net.SetDefaultTimeout, net.SetDefaultReadTimeout,\nnet.SetDefaultWriteTimeout, net.SetDefaultConnectTimeout? While having global variables\nlike that might not be a good idea in general, usually single application doesn't use\ndifferent default timeouts for different sockets/connections, so being able to set\nreasonable defaults on per-application basic might be useful.\u003c/pre\u003e",
