How often \ndoes somebody need to specify the local address?  Usually it'll be blank.  Even the \ndocs highlight this ugliness in their examples:\n\nDial(\"tcp\", \"\", \"12.34.56.78:80\")\nDial(\"tcp\", \"\", \"google.com:80\")\nDial(\"tcp\", \"\", \"[de:ad:be:ef::ca:fe]:80\")\n\nWhy not (something like) instantiate a \"DialParams\" message, and Dial on that?\n\npendingDial := conn.DialParams(\"tcp\", \"12.34.56.78:80\")\npendingDial.SetTimeout(100)\ntcp := pendingDial.Dial()\n\nKeep Dial() if you want, but DialParams gives extensibility.  In common case:\n\ntcp := conn.DialParams(\"tcp\", \"google.com:80\").Dial()\n\nMaybe that's not idiomatic Go code, though.\n\nBut a bunch of positional parameters is ugly, especially when 1 or more of them is \noften not set.\u003c/pre\u003e",
