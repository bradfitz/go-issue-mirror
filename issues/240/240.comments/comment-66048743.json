There are\ngenerally two steps: one for allocating the data structure, and then a second one for\n\"dialing\" out.  This gives some time for further tweaking the parameters before an\naction is performed. Since Go is acting differently, it's missing an obvious place\nfor sticking the setting change.\n\nTwo high-level suggestions on how to fix this:\n\n1) Separate out the two actions in Go as well.  E.g Prepare() returns the allocated\nstruct which has some further actions on it, plus the Dial() method to connect out,\nor similar.\n\n2) Provide a generic settings parameter to Dial(), which may be given through\ndifferent structs/interfaces depending on the type of options needed by the\noperation, and also may be nil for defaults.  This ensures forward compatibility with\nnew settings, and enables custom actions to be done within Dial() itself before any\ndelaying calls take place.\u003c/pre\u003e",
