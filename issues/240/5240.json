	"body": "by **kballard**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhen running ./all.bash with GODIST_FINAL set and $GOROOT/bin not in $PATH, the final\noutput of ./all.bash incorrectly claims that I need to add $GOROOT/bin to my PATH. This\nis incorrect because I actually need $GODIST_FINAL/bin in path. Specifically, this is\nwhat I'm seeing:\n\n  Installed Go for darwin/amd64 in /Volumes/UserData/Users/kballard/go\n  Installed commands in /Volumes/UserData/Users/kballard/go/bin\n  *** You need to add /Volumes/UserData/Users/kballard/go/bin to your PATH.\n  \n  On OS X the debuggers must be installed setgid procmod.\n  Read and run ./sudo.bash to install the debuggers.\n  \n  The binaries expect /Volumes/UserData/Users/kballard/go to be copied or moved to /usr/local/go\n\nThe line starting with *** is incorrect, as shown by the final line.\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nMac OS X 10.8.3\n\nWhich version are you using?
