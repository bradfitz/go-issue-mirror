You can not real ALL\nby ReadAll since it is too big of a data block and you have to stream bytes to a file or\nsocket manually. So, at some point here will be a window (or casual bug) of data arrived\nto pipe and not readed by some sort of read command. And at the same moment tar exists\nand you lose this part of data.\n\nPlease fix.\u003c/pre\u003e",
