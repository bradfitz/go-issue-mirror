But this only on Windows. It may actually be Windows itself which prevents it\nfrom working. I'm not really sure how this could be fixed, but seems to me that leaving\nfolders around with .exe-s in them would not be expected... maybe RemoveAll or this call\n\u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/cmd/go/test.go#970\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/cmd/go/test.go#970\u003c/a\u003e\ncould benefit from waiting max 1 sec in a for look trying to call RemoveAll until either\nsucceeds or timeout expires, and show an error if it doesn't succeed, at least the user\nwould know it has some leftover files to manually delete or risk disk size decreasing in\ntime.\n\nWhat I am after, I think, is ensuring that this works as intended (that is, the temp\nfolder is deleted), in the spirit of program correctness or something:)\u003c/pre\u003e",
