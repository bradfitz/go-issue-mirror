But this only on Windows.\n\nLike I said earlier: \"folder with running executable cannot be deleted on Windows\". It\nis the way Windows works. Linux will delete any file/folder even if executable is\nrunning.\n\n\u003e ... It may actually be Windows itself which prevents it from working. \n\nCorrect\n\n\u003e ... I'm not really sure how this could be fixed, but seems to me that leaving folders\naround with .exe-s in them would not be expected... \n\nWe just need to try our best to clean after ourselves. It means, we have to wait until\nprocess is exited before attempting to delete the file.\n\n\u003e ... maybe RemoveAll or this call\n\u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/cmd/go/test.go#970\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/cmd/go/test.go#970\u003c/a\u003e\ncould benefit ...\n\nI do not see any problem with go command. If you do, then show me.\n\n\u003e ... and show an error if it doesn't succeed, at least the user would know it has some\nleftover files to manually delete or risk disk size decreasing in time.\n\nI don't see this as something that requires users attention. My TEMP directory is always\nfull of junk. Most of it is not Go related.\n\n\u003e ... What I am after, I think, is ensuring that this works as intended (that is, the\ntemp folder is deleted), in the spirit of program correctness or something:)\n\nI agree. You as a programer should try to do your best to clean after yourself.\n\nI don't think there is anything we can do here. Do you?\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
