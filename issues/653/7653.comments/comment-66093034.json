The obsoleted Linux's AF_INET/SOCK_PACKET access interface\nrequires struct sockaddr in C, syscall.RawSockaddr in Go. But syscall.Bind requires a\nstruct that implements syscall.Sockaddr interface for its argument. So, trying to make\nAF_INET/SOCK_PACKET socket work in Go is waste of time. Instead, you can use address\nfamily AF_PACKET socket (see attached for the detail), or LSF, PF_RING, other.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Invalid**._\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/7653/3/afpacket.go\"\u003eafpacket.go\u003c/a\u003e (885 bytes)",
