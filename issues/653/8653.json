	"body": "Currently when I need to rebuild race runtime (syso files) I need to find a linux,\r\nwindows, darwin and freebsd machine; ssh into them and do some manual\r\nactions. This is painful, non-reproducible and only I know how to do\r\nit. If we have linux/windows/darwin/freebsd VMs on GCE, we could automate the process of\r\nbuilding the race runtime. Basically you give it revision number, and it gives you 4\r\nrace_goos.syso files.\r\nBrad says it's totally possible.",
