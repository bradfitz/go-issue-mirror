	"body": "A common case (for me at least) is for code to be written in a given package and than to be moved to another package.\r\n\r\nCoping the code (+ changing the package) works great, but if the code was depending on the package it was moved into, go will die with import cycle. \r\n\r\nRemoving the package and running goimports adds it again - this for me happens on saving the file.\r\n\r\nIt seems reasonable that importing the current package is not desirable and in my setup (vim + vim-go) the file looks OK in vim even though it's not. \r\n\r\nI propose goimports to remove(not add) the current package.",
