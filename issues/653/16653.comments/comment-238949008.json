	"body": "The problem in this case is that the second `return a[i]` is deadcode. The second condition can be reached only `if i \u003e= len(a)` so the index is out of bounds which is why prove prints \"Disproved\". \r\n\r\nThere is indeed a missed optimization and the second condition is not fully removed. If you find a correctness issue, let me know. Otherwise, I'll address this once the go1.8 opens and I have some spare time.\r\n\r\nedit: The difference between the output is because it looks at different facts to establish the truth value. For `f` it uses `i \u003e= 10 \u0026\u0026 i \u003c len(a)` and for `g` it uses `uint(i) \u003c uint(len(a))`.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: It's not a bug. It's dead code.",
