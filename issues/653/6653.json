Obviously not\nfixable before go2.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/VXR_fZ20Qr\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/VXR_fZ20Qr\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nCompile error, floating point assignment after integer division. \n\nWhat do you see instead?\nPerforms integer division and then assigns the value to a float64. Not likely the\ndesired result.\u003c/pre\u003e",
