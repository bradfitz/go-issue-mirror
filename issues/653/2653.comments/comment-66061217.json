Some points which may (or may not) be useful:\n\n* If you cast the call to Sprintf  to float32(3.14159) then only one allocation is used,\nwhich is strange because the internal formatFloat routine expects a float64 so there are\nlots of conversions between float32 -\u003e float64 -\u003e uint64.\n* This commit,\n\u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=6cfb9f2415fab4b8fed834afac05afeb9fb9ee8b\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=6cfb9f2415fab4b8fed834afac05afeb9fb9ee8b\u003c/a\u003e,\nimproved the count from 6 to 2, it is possible it reduced it to 1 on 64bit machines\nunintentionally, or perhaps a later change improved for 64bit hosts unintentionally.\u003c/pre\u003e",
