In particular, it assumes the padding between the current entry and the next entry is no more than 16 bytes, because no Go architecture aligns functions to more than 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nBut if you're using the extra linking modes then foreign code chunks (.text sections from foreign .o files) end up in the text segment too, and they can have arbitrarily larger alignments. Perhaps that is what happened here. I will disable the test if the thing coming up is not Go code.\r\n",
