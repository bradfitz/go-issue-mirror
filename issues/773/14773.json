	"body": "The random number generator used in ioutil package is the `ranqd1` function implemented in Numerical Recipes.  The problem with Numerical Recipes is that all the code is under copyright, and it is illegal to use it inside the Go standard library.\r\n\r\nI suggest to replace the comment `// constants from Numerical Recipes` with something like `the constant a has been suggested by Knuth and the constant b has been extensively tested by H.W. Lewis`.",
