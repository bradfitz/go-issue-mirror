What it doesn't know is that they're the same directory. Worse, when it tries\nto build the two - in parallel - it writes one to $WORK\\math\\rand\\obj and the other to\n$WORK\\math\\Rand\\obj. Of course, those are the same directory too, so the one compilation\nis overwriting the first's files as the first tries to pack them into an archive. That\ncauses the pack errors.\n\nI suppose one solution is to use SameFile to decide if two directories are the same, but\nthat will be system dependent.\n\nAnother possible solution is to reject any program that imports (perhaps indirectly) two\npaths that differ only in case. That's what I'm leaning toward right now.\n\nThanks for the report.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **go1.1**, removed **priority-triage**, **go1.1maybe**._\n\n_Owner changed to @rsc._\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
