	"body": "Due to the fact that every board has different mappings of the actual physical pins, we need to introduce a higher level layer numeric system to name the pins. Being able to have such a layer will make the user code portable across multiple boards. E.g. the GPIO package might use names like \"IO25\" to refer to the physical pin 22 on Raspberry Pi boards.\r\n",
