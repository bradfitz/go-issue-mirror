	"body": "`go test` doesn't compile and report compilation errors if the example doesn't have an output section. This used to be different in the past and we were able to use examples to provide usage snippets without worrying that they are broken.\r\n\r\nThe current requirement to have an output section is impractical in complex examples such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc ExampleClientCredentialsJSON() {\r\n\tkey, err := ioutil.ReadFile(\"/path/to/downloaded-client-secret.json\")\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tcfg, err := google.ConfigFromJSON(key, datastore.ScopeDatastore)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tclient, err := datastore.NewClient(\r\n\t\tctx, \"project-id\", option.WithTokenSource(cfg.TokenSource(ctx, nil)))\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\r\n\t}\r\n\t// output:\r\n\t// something to assert\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere go test is trying to run the block and fails because it cannot find the downloaded-client-secret.json. Since we are only caring about the integrity of the examples and not willing to verify them, please give us an option to build examples without output assertion.",
