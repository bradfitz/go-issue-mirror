It's just uncommon for Linux or other Unix because most software\nare installed from source and can afford to hardcode paths. However, for\ncommercial software, it's very common to have relocatable packages in that\nyou can install it to any location and it will just work. The ELF file\nformat even has $ORIGIN to support referencing shared libraries relative to\nthe executable. Therefore I won't call the need undefined: It's actually\nwell defined and has well defined (and deployed) solutions too.\n",
