Only the little-endian \u003c-\u003e big-endian issue? I realise this code is 4 years old, so it might be hard to remember.\r\n\r\nAlso: The current version of the spec only looks for \"mp4\", not all the other types (iso, M4V, ...) that the original code checks for. How closely should the spec be followed here?\r\n\r\nIn order to follow the current version of the spec, only a number, and which strings to consider valid, need to be changed.",
