	"body": "I am currently working on porting an internal https based service that uses client certificates to establish secure connections and am running into problems where the client certificate fails to be parsed by `tls.X509KeyPair(cert, key)` because the char `@` is used in the client certificate... With current master, `X509KeyPair` returns error `PrintableString contains invalid character`\r\n\r\nQuick fix: (asn1.go `isPrintable` func)\r\n\r\n```\r\nb == '*' ||\r\nb == '@'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut not sure how well this will be accepted. Please advice. Thanks.",
