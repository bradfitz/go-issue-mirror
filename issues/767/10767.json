	"body": "I believe the functions Client.doFollowingRedirects and shouldRedirect{Post,Get} are incorrect according to http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html. Of the 4 redirect codes considered in this code, 301, 302, and 307 should redirect for GET and HEAD only. 303 should always redirect, and always convert the method to GET.\r\n\r\nCurrently 302 and 303 are redirecting POST and PUT, and converting to GET in doing so. I doubt anyone is relying on the current broken behaviour as it doesn't work as expected for due to #3665, which prematurely consumes the original request body when using POST/PUT in a safe way.",
