So there's infinitely many valid, but\ndifferent encodings carrying the same semantics for any given set of JSON encoded\nvalues. IOW, there's no such thing as a \"spurious newline\" between JSON tokens. It's the\ntest which is broken if it depends on particular white space configuration, because that\ncan change at any time without breaking the API.\n\nIMHO: #WAI\u003c/pre\u003e",
