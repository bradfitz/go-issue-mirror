But perhaps I didn't use go install -a in 1.6, or maybe my code has changed in some significant way.\r\n\r\nI reinstalled 1.6.3 and tried the same command, and got:\r\nruntime/cgo: pthread_create failed: Resource temporarily unavailable\r\n\r\nToday I get the same error in 1.7,  instead of the original error that helpfully pointed out the ulimit issue. A regular install, without -a, after modifying only a few files, doesn't have any problem.",
