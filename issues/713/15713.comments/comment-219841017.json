	"body": "DynamicRecordSizing writes the first 1MB in ~1KB chunks instead of ~16KB chunks. Some loss of throughput is expected as this trades throughput for latency early in the connection.\r\n\r\nThe 1MB constant may benefit from tuning. I borrowed that constant from the Google frontend servers. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like much thought went into that constant (or at least, the thought process was not documented anywhere) and I could not find benchmark data. I'm not even sure what the right benchmarks would be -- there are competing interests and the right value will likely depend on the underlying network speed and specifics of the application layer.",
