The idea was that other people should have domain names (with dots) in their paths, and the standard library did not. But vendoring introduces domain names into the standard library, and that vendored hpack package looks stale because it's not \"standard\", so it doesn't fall under the \"released packages are not out of date\" clause.\r\n\r\nIt looks like we want to replace the final clause above with something like:\r\n\r\n    (strings.HasPrefix(p.ImportPath, \"cmd/\") || strings.HasPrefix(p.ImportPath, \"vendor/\") || !strings.Contains(p.ImportPath, \".\")\r\n\r\nWill fix tomorrow.",
