	"body": "Oh! `go get` is trying to reinstall the standard library. I missed that. I thought it was trying to _read_ the files, not _write_ them. It makes sense that writing them would fail. The question now is why it thinks they're out of date. And the answer is probably the time stamps combined with the fact that the beta is not considered a \"release\". The rebuild logic for releases is different from being on the dev branch in cmd/go. We need to get cmd/go into the release logic for betas.\r\n",
