	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI believe we could add possessive quantifiers to the regexp package.  This would be\nuseful for people who are familiar with them from other regexp packages.\n\nx*+ would mean \u0026quot;match zero or more x, match all possible\u0026quot;.  Similarly for x++,\nx?+, x{n,m}+, and x{n,}+.  And I guess we should accept x{n}+ as well although it has\nthe same meaning as x{n}.\n\nI think the only effect of using a possessive quantifier would be to turn some matches\ninto non-matches.  For example, a*(a|b) matches aa.  a*+(a|b) does not, because the a*+\nmatches aa and there is nothing left to match (a|b).\u003c/pre\u003e",
