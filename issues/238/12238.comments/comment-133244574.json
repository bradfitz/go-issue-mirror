I'm trying to put together a reproducer, but probably won't have something until tomorrow.\r\n\r\n@noxiouz, do you happen to know if the call from C to go_stat_callback happens on a thread that was created by C or by Go? (I suspect it doesn't matter, but might help me narrow down the reproducer.)\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, there are a few things you can do to work around this.
