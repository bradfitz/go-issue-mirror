The second argument is uint64 which is used as key to get go function from global map (it's a kind of context). Inside ```go_stat_callback``` I get a proper context from a map, cast it to go function and call it.\r\nThere are many such callbacks in the code, but the occurs only in that callback. I assume, that it's connected with the size of frame. All other callbacks receives small data, but stat callback receives megabytes of data. \r\nShould I attach any code links?\r\n",
