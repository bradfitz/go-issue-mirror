AFAICT, it is necessary to have a Go-\u003eC-\u003eGo-\u003eC transition for it to happen, but that's all I know right now.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to narrow it down to a small repro case that doesn't involve the entire sqlite library, I'll update if I manage to get one. Unfortunately this isn't my day job, so it may be slow going :(",
