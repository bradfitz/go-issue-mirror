This helps because Fedora\nextracts the debug symbols during build and packages them separately. The build-id\nallows the system to correctly find (and download) the correct debuginfo package for any\ngiven binary.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.23.1/ld/Options.html#index-g_t_002d_002dbuild_002did-271\"\u003ehttp://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.23.1/ld/Options.html#index-g_t_002d_002dbuild_002did-271\u003c/a\u003e\n\nGo's linker has the build-id support, but does not currently implement the exact sha1\nhashing that the system linker does.\n\nActually, perhaps the best way forward is to figure out how to put build-id information\ninto an arbitrary existing binary. This would solve the issue in a general way without\nanything special from Go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
