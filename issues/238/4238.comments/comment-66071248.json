This solves \u0026*p and \u0026p.Field for \"small\" field offsets.\n\nThe \u0026p.F4096 panic is an implementation issue: For instance, one could conceive an\nimplementation where pointers are always a pair (base pointer, offset) and the this\npanic could be avoided (at the cost of a more expensive implementation). I'd be ok with\na short sentence mentioning an implementation restriction.\u003c/pre\u003e",
