(I\nwouldn't be surprised...)\n\n[11:30] \u0026lt;jrick\u0026gt; andlabs: I think \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/8238\"\u003eissue #8238\u003c/a\u003e is related to clang, when I build go\n1.3 with gcc, cgo doesn't panic (but I get other weirdness with *C.T and *C.struct__T\nerrors)\n[11:32] \u0026lt;jrick\u0026gt; what's even more odd is that the *C.struct__T errors don't seem\ndeterministic\n[11:32] \u0026lt;jrick\u0026gt; i.e. run go get once, and the build fails\n[11:33] \u0026lt;jrick\u0026gt; run it again, and everything works :/\n[11:33] \u0026lt;jrick\u0026gt; I wonder if my glib/gtk packages are built with clang\n\nThat being said, I can try both comments's requests on OS X later (and then remember how\nto use GNUstep for a Linux-based example).\u003c/pre\u003e",
