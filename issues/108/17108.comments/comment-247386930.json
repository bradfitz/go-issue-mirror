Examples of how I use a single\n\u003e index to identify child nodes:\n\u003e\n\u003e    - To find the i'th child Node of a CallExpr: i==0 means Fun, and\n\u003e    otherwise you want Args[i-1].\n\u003e    - To find the i'th child of an AssignStmt, i\u003clen(Lhs) means Lhs[i],\n\u003e    and otherwise you want Rhs[i-len(Lhs)].\n\u003e\n\u003e That said, I'm not opposed to field names.\n\u003e\nAh, so you would flatten out the scalar fields and the slices into one\nsequence.  Makes sense, though the bookkeeping seems onerous.\n",
