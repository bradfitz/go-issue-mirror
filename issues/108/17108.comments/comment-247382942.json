I think it can be done but it will be difficult to guarantee 100% semantic equivalence w/o manually checking each case, or an extensive test suite testing each node type and exit scenario. For one, Walk doesn't invoke the visitor if a node is nil, while Apply probably should (and my prototype currently does) so that the pre/post closures have a chance to rewrite/set the node (that feature will make it possible to implement Walk, while Walk could not be used to implement Apply since it misses nodes).",
