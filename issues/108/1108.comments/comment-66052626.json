I don't want this functionality to be masked by something\nelse.\n\nAs far as I know, ReportEvent facility is supposed to be used by \"service\" type\napplications (\u003ca href=\"http://www.commsoft.com/services.html)\"\u003ehttp://www.commsoft.com/services.html)\u003c/a\u003e only. These do not have console to\nreport errors, so it is the only way for them to be visible. Another issue, I could be\nwrong here, but as far as I know, ReportEvent require strategically placed on disk\nresources (dll/exe/...) to function. See \u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/ced5T\"\u003ehttp://goo.gl/ced5T\u003c/a\u003e for more details, but,\nsimply speaking, ReportEvent uses dwEventID (an int) that is just a reference to a\nformat string that must live in some permanent file. Event viewer program will need\nresource file to be present all the time to display error messages properly. For\n\"service\" programs, these format strings are normally part of service exe file - once\n\"installed\" at a particular location, it is always present.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
