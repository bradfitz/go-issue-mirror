See the\ndocs for it \u003ca href=\"http://go.pkgdoc.org/code.google.com/p/winsvc/eventlog\"\u003ehttp://go.pkgdoc.org/code.google.com/p/winsvc/eventlog\u003c/a\u003e. Perhaps, I could use\nmy code in log/syslog.\n\nUnfortunately, the api is different. Also code.google.com/p/winsvc/eventlog provides for\n\"event message file\" installation, so event log entries look presentable. For example,\nsimple \"error\" message looks like:\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\nThe description for Event ID ( 3 ) in Source ( mylog ) cannot be found. The local\ncomputer may not have the necessary registry information or message DLL files to display\nmessages from a remote computer. You may be able to use the /AUXSOURCE= flag to retrieve\nthis description; see Help and Support for details. The following information is part of\nthe event: error.\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\n\nwithout \"event message file\".\n\n@Russ, if you still wants to proceed with this plan, please, let me know how you want to\nfit code.google.com/p/winsvc/eventlog into log/syslog.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
