This will prefix every event with a\ndefault message, but I really don't think the log package by itself should alter the\nregistry in normal runtime. The Registry entry is so flat and there's a decent chance\nyou will overwrite a different service name. Also, a running program may be run with\nlower permissions then what is required to modify the registry at runtime. \n\nWhen running a program as a service (daemon) on windows, I have to \"Install\" it anyway,\nthat is when the registry should be modified.\n\nEmbedded resource strings don't have much to do with this issue. The main issue is\ncreating the registry entries that point to the resource strings, and as pointed out\nabove, this can be any pre-existing executable.\u003c/pre\u003e",
