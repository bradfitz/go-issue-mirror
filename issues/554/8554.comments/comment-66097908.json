The\ncurrent DeepEqual is essentially wrong, it gives an answer when in fact it doesn't know.\nSomeone decided that returning 'false' was a practical solution, but it's not practical,\nit just makes the function useless when dealing with function pointers. There is no\nthorough reasoning behind the 'false' return value that I can find, in the original\nissue it was just proposed by someone and then implemented without any comments.\n\nI don't see where the resistance is coming from not to think about a solution for this\nproblem. Basically writing unit tests for Structs with functions is seriously\nimpractical in Go, requiring me to copy large parts of the runtime. Doesn't that\nindicate a missed feature? The solution(s) I proposed are convenient and won't hinder\nany existing implementations.\u003c/pre\u003e",
