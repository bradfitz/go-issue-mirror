And if you use conditional compilation to also support older\n\u003e Go versions, you need to add the definition to your source code anyway.\n\nI'm not really concerned about this issue, it's no problem to define the constant within\ndocker in the mean time (or permanently if Go doesn't support it).\u003c/pre\u003e",
