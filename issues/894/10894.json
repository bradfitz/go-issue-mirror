It would be useful if the library also included a function to operate in the scope of the time's current Location. Otherwise, one has to code one's own solution to get, for example, the midnight time of a given time:\r\n\r\nfunc midnightOf(t time.Time) time.Time {\r\n  d := time.Duration(-t.Hour()) * time.Hour +\r\n    time.Duration(-t.Minute()) * time.Minute +\r\n    time.Duration(-t.Second()) * time.Second +\r\n    time.Duration(-t.Nanosecond) * time.Nanosecond\r\n  return t.Add(d)\r\n}",
