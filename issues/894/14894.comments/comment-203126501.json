It is available on http://9legacy.org/download/go/2016-03-29/9front.qcow2.bz2 (516 MB)\r\n\r\nYou can run it under QEMU with the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nqemu-system-x86_64 -machine accel=kvm -net user -net nic,model=virtio -m 3072 -vga std -drive if=none,id=hd,file=9front.qcow2 -device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scsi -device scsi-hd,drive=hd -boot c\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter booting the image, you get rio running with a terminal open.\r\nAn installation of Go (current master branch) is available in /usr/go. So you can run:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd /usr/go/src \u0026\u0026 all.rc\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther installations of Go 1.4 to 1.7 (pre-built) are available in `/usr/glenda/go1.[4567]`. In the current profile, the `GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP` variable is set to `/usr/glenda/go1.7`.\r\n\r\nYou can edit files with `sam` or `acme`. A minimal set of Git commands is available, so you can run `git pull` to update the tree, or `git checkout` to check another branch/tag/sha1 or `git clone` to clone a repository.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that I can reproduce the issue only if the virtual machine has been configured with more than 2480 MB of memory, approximately.\r\nThe builder used to have 4 GB of memory, and I've just lowered it to 2 GB to keep the build going.",
