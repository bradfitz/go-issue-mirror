I see the ticket remains Closed.\r\n\r\nI'm finding finance houses are offering these four due to their corporate policies and so I can't connect to them.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256\r\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256\r\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese two are the closest in cipherSuites, but are SHA1.\r\n\r\n```go\r\n{TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, 16, 20, 16, rsaKA, 0, cipherAES, macSHA1, nil},  \r\n{TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA, 32, 20, 16, rsaKA, 0, cipherAES, macSHA1, nil},  \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does seem as if crypto/tls's users should be able to specify suites, or else the default list should be bigger even if there are many that are suiteDefaultOff to allow the caller to specify them.\r\n\r\n@agl, please correct me if I've got the wrong end of the stick.",
