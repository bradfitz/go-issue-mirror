For reference: http://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Variable_declarations\r\n\r\n\"Implementation restriction: A compiler may make it illegal to declare a variable inside a function body if the variable is never used.\"\r\n\r\nIn this block, the assignment\r\n\r\n_ = x\r\n\r\nuses the variable x. There's no promise of an error if a variable is assigned to, but not used later.\r\n\r\nOne might argue that assignment to _ doesn't constitute a \"use\", but in fact this exact pattern is used all over the place to mark a use for the compiler when we don't have another one (e.g. during development).",
