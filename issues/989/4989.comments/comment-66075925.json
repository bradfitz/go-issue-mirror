Go 1.0.3 I\nbelieve has the same caveat, I was rather surprised that it built correctly.  I am only\nbuilding out of curiosity - for testing and bug tracking.  \nIf go 1.1 cannot support rhel5, this is not really an issue as far as I'm concerned -\nalthough I do feel it's some size of the enterprise market.  Since 'go' was not in\nexistence even at the time that RHEL5 was released, it's not necessarily a package that\nshould remain as outdated as the OS for some legacy reasons - unless of course that has\nbecome a requirement. \nI only wanted to note the issue in the case that this is truly a bug in the code change,\nrather than a purposefully designed change.  I don't keep up on all of the happenings\nand changes as I'd like, but I didn't recall an explicit note/reason/announcement\nregarding this.  I understand also it's not the developer's job to provide this\nnecessarily, as it's covered in the 'not supported' realm, but I'm curious nonetheless.\n\nThank you for your time and reply.\u003c/pre\u003e",
