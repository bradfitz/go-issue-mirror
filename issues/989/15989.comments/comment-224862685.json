In fact, if we could implement it today NewSignerFromKey() should probably take a crypto.PrivateKey.\r\n\r\nI think in principle it is OK to add a Key method to ssh.PublicKey returning the crypto.PublicKey.\r\n\r\nHowever, since PublicKey is an interface, this potentially breaks compatibility with existing code. It probably doesn't in practice (since I think you can't write useful key implementations outside the SSH package). If you can make a case (with data) that this won't break anyone, I'm happy to accept such a change.  \r\n\r\n",
