	"body": "I am using the ssh protocol in an atypical scenario and would like to perform additional checking in my PublicKeyCallback function.  I would like to have access to the underlying crypto.PublicKey that sits behind the ssh.PublicKey.  I can't find a clean way to achieve this currently.\r\n\r\nWould it be acceptable to expose this in come way?  I'm happy to submit a CL if so.\r\n\r\nThe two ways I can see would be a new method on ssh.PublicKey to expose it directly, or to export various types that implement ssh.PublicKey so that I can type assert to them and act accordingly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if this is seen as breaking the intended encapsulation of ssh.PublicKey, I'd be interested in knowing other (evil, hacky) ways I might do so without modifying golang.org/x/crypto/ssh ?",
