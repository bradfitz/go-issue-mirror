	"body": "This block\r\n{\r\n    x := 0\r\n    _ = x\r\n    x = 1\r\n}\r\ncompiles without error, whereas I would expect an error on the \"x=1\" line.  Something like \"x assigned and not used\".\r\n\r\nFor precedent we have the existing \"x declared and not used\" error.  This is essentially the same error.\r\n\r\nFor someone bitten by the lack of this error, see http://www.qureet.com/blog/golang-beartrap/",
