This\nis useful for removing temporary paths from the binary, so that repeated builds produce\nbyte-for-byte identical outputs.\n\nWe need this functionality, but probably not in pack. We've arranged so that pack is not\nnecessary for most packages: 6g writes out .a files directly, and 'go' appends other\nsupporting files directly too. There is no invocation of pack during make.bash, for\nexample. Putting the P functionality into pack would require invoking pack again. The\ntheory behind not invoking pack is that instead of using pack to convert to the format\nyou want, you can save an I/O round if you make the original writer write out the format\nyou want in the first place. This suggests that the P functionality should be in 6a, 6c,\nand 6g instead.\n\nCL 88300045 does this.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Started**._",
