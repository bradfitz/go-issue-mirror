The basic motivation here is that when you run 'go build' (to build the code in the current directory) you want to see a compiler error reported in 'foo.go' and not 'c:\\the\\directory\\you\\are\\already\\in\\foo.go'.\r\n\r\nImport paths are different: they are always printed fully qualified (even including unvendoring them). And go list is really just shorthand for go list -f '{{.ImportPath}}'.\r\n\r\n",
