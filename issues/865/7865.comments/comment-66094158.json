To test this theory, I split the 'filetype plugin\nindent off' into two statements: 'filetype plugin off' and 'filetype indent off'. When\neither one of those lines is present, it causes the error status to return 1 again.\n\nI would replace the whole block with (this works for me, I also verified go syntax\nhighlighting to be active):\n\" Some Linux distributions set filetype in /etc/vimrc.\nset runtimepath+=$GOROOT/misc/vim \" replace $GOROOT with the output of: go env GOROOT\n\n\" Now toggle filetype after changing runtimepath to force Vim to reload them.\nfiletype off\nfiletype on\u003c/pre\u003e",
