If you cancel a request before it has been started, RoundTrip might block indefinitely when the request does issue, leading to a leaked goroutine and a leaked net.Conn since you never end up calling resp.Body.Close() on the response.\r\n\r\nClearly this is a punt to go1.6 issue, but still think we need to address this. The current API makes it too easy to write code that is subtly wrong.",
