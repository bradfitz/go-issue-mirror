	"body": "As pointed out in that thread, the documentation is correct. You can't cancel it until it's been started.\r\n\r\nThis code is also \"racy\":\r\n\r\n```go\r\nvar mu sync.Mutex\r\nm := map[string]string{}\r\ngo func() { mu.Lock(); m[\"foo\"] = \"bar\"; mu.Unlock() }()\r\ngo func() { mu.Lock(); delete(m, \"foo\"); mu.Unlock() }()\r\n```\r\n\r\n... sometimes the map entry will be there and sometimes it won't, because you're not waiting to delete it until it's been added.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean there's a bug with maps or with `delete`.\r\n\r\nWe could add more words if that would help, but we can't start adding contexts to APIs for cancellation because the standard library a) doesn't have them, and b) is frozen.\r\n",
