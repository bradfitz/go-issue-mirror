	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\nThis is a godoc.org issue, so whichever version gddo is running at the moment (go1.6?)\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nThis is a godoc.org issue, probably linux.\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nBrowse to https://godoc.org/encoding/xml and compare with https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/xml/\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nA link reasonably high up on the page linking to the single BUG section.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nNo link.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to either reflect the behaviour of golang.org/pkg, or IMO preferably have a link next to \"Index | Examples | Files\".\r\n",
