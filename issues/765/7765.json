	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe scanner's interpretation of a //line directive that lacks a filename, such as this:\n\n//line :1\n\nis very surprising.  I would have expected it to mean either \u0026quot;line 1 of the current\nfile\u0026quot;, or \u0026quot;line 1 of the file specified by the previous //line\ndirective\u0026quot;, but instead it means \u0026quot;line 1 of the directory containing the\ncurrent file\u0026quot;.  This is obviously nonsensical since directories don't have lines,\nbut this is actually seems to be the intended behaviour, if\ngo/scanner/scanner_test.go:497 is to be believed:\n\n497: {\u0026quot;\\n//line :1\\n  line1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;dir\u0026quot;, 1},\n\nI think this is a bug.  I would prefer either of the two interpretations I suggested\nover the current one.\n\n(Why do I care?  Because the cgo preprocessor emits files containing \u0026quot;//line\n:1\u0026quot; prior to each field of a struct type.  I suspect that is probably unintended\ntoo, but that's another story.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
