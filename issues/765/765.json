	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. install sdl (i used macports)\n2. install go-sdl (github.com/banthar/Go-SDL). you can't use goinstall, and each\nmakefile needs to be tweaked to include the following line:\nCGO_CFLAGS:=`pkg-config --cflags sdl | sed 's:\\(-I[^ ]*\\)/SDL:\\1:'`)\n3. build and run Go-SDL/test/test\n\nthis gives the error:\nlibcgo: could not obtain pthread_keys\n\twanted 0x108 and 0x109\n\tgot 0x10b 0x10c 0x10d 0x10e 0x10f 0x110 0x111 0x112 0x113 0x114 0x115 0x116 0x117 \n0x118 0x119 0x11a\n\nit looks like libsdl has grabbed too many thread keys already\nbefore libcgo gets a look in. perhaps 0x108 and 0x109 should be\nconsiderably higher numbers.\n\nand indeed, when i change my local repository to use 0x128 and 0x129 (0x4e8)\nthings get much further (still doesn't work, but that's another issue)\n\ndarwin 386 ad738cffc309+ tip\u003c/pre\u003e",
