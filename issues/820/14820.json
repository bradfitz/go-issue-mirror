	"body": "Hi, I'm in the middle of implementing support for iterating over [grapheme clusters](http://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries) in a project that I am working on and it seems like something that would be a good fit for the `golang.org/x/text`. I wanted to reach out and see how much interest there would be around this and whether I should work on making something that would fit into this project. I was thinking the interface could be somewhat like this (naming just a stand-in for now, not a big fan of the name decode) :\r\n```go\r\npackage grapheme\r\n\r\n// Decode reads the first grapheme cluster out of s and return it. To get the length of the\r\n// grapheme simply take the len() of the return value.\r\nfunc Decode(s string) string\r\n```\r\n\r\nI didn't want to go through the whole proposal process until I get an idea of whether there might be interest for this. I hope this is the right forum for this, if not, I'd appreciate being pointed to the right place.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",
