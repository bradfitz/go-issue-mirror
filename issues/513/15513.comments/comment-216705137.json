I can, however, see this for a particular project or set of packages, in which case this becomes very useful. Think e.g. of cross-compiling all the tests for your project and having to only scp a single binary.\r\n\r\n\u003e cmd/go doesn't support negative patterns\r\n\r\nYes, this is unfortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\nI apologize, but I don't quite understand the resistance here. It seems like the resistance is \"something could go wrong\". But this doesn't really seem like a big footgun to me. And when this is helpful, like cross-compiling all tests for a big project or keeping around an old version for benchmarking or testing compilation speed, it is very helpful, and users will be motivated to make it work (or not use it). And it is entirely backwards compatible.\r\n",
