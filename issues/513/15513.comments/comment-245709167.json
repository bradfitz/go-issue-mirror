I want the test binaries, to ship around the network and shard out isolated test execution. But I want to burn CPU as hard as possible where it's not latency sensitive. (That is, I can run compilation jobs at 100% CPU, but tests are often flaky at 100% if they sleep or depend on time.)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
