	"body": "I'm new to Go, but FWIW, the lack of this feature is one of the most frustrating things that I have found so far about the tooling. I tend to write production code and test code at the same time, and during my normal dev cycle I want to see if things compile many more times than I want to run the tests. So right now I'm doing roughly the same thing as stated above inside my project with a few packages: basically\r\n\r\nfor i in `go list ./...`; do go test -c $i; done\r\n\r\nIt would be great if this could be done in one pass with a single link and have it be up to the user to deal with conflicts as suggested by @bradfitz",
