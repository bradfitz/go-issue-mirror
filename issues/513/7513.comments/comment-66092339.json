And that, I\nsuspect, works on your system (Please confirm). If you run tests out of context (with\nsome GO... variables set in a particular way), then some tests might fail.\n\nI have no problem with your change \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/74160043/\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/74160043/\u003c/a\u003e in general,\nbut I don't know enough about how gcc works. I'm worried it might break in some\nscenarios. Given that nothing is broken (if you confirm all.bat runs to success on your\nsystem), I would suggest we do nothing.\n\nClosing issue for now.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Invalid**._",
