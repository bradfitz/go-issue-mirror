I like to make sure the build tree is alright so I will run\nthe tests if I'm compiling from windows. Technically I'm cross-compiling, but Windows\nblurs the line here a bit.\n\nAs we both mentioned, they are due to different bitness. My 64-bit host system is\ntesting 32-bit go, and gcc is trying to make a 64-bit dll in this test.\n\nAgain, I know testing while cross-compiling isn't typically done, I think it can make\nsense here. If this still doesn't make sense, feel free to close the issue. Probably not\nworth spending much more time one.\u003c/pre\u003e",
