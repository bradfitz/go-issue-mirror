I found a \"break\" when I was prepping\nthe 386 compiler chain for initial 1.3 testing now that the builders are green(-ish),\nthen looked into it. Found it was a false issue (the build would be fine, but thought\nI'd look into fixing the test before 1.3 got baked.\n\nSo for me, all.bat fails when I build my 386 tools on my amd64 system.\n\nThanks again,\n-Daniel\u003c/pre\u003e",
