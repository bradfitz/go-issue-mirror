	"body": "by **per.arneng**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhen coding I (and others) normally write some code and notice a strange\nbehaviour and then comment out the newly written code to get back to a\nworking state. It is then very annoying to have to scroll up to the head of\nthe file just to toggle comments of any unused imports. I think a warning\nwould be more suitable. This would enhance productivity to be able to\ncompile with warning on this instead of error.\n\nThe same issue goes for unused variables.\u003c/pre\u003e",
