	"body": "This was indeed the problem.  $GOPATH was set to $HOME/go, but $GOROOT was not set. There was also an old installation in /usr/local/go instead of in $HOME/go. Interestingly, $HOME/go/bin was in the path ahead of /usr/local/go/bin. I'm not sure why it was picking up the old installation.\r\n\r\nI was having problems building some things, but not others. I should have checked the environment variables, but this setup worked perfectly fine in 1.5; also the nature of the error message lead me to believe that GOROOT was set.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
