	"body": "see #13809\r\n\r\nhttps://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Environment_variables\r\n\r\nThe above documentation is very sparse and should be expanded. It is not clear enough on what this variable does and what it's used for. Some questions that should be answered in the documentation:\r\n\r\n* What are valid values? Does it have to be a valid go installation path, or can it be any value? (The documentation makes it sound like it should to be a valid go installation, but maybe not? It just says it's used to overwrite the stack trace, not that it's used for actual building)\r\n* Does it overwrite paths that are relative to GOPATH (i.e. user source), or only paths relative to GOROOT? (The documentation makes it sound like only GOROOT paths are overwritten)\r\n* When should the variable be used (i.e. under what use cases)? Currently, the documentation makes this variable seem downright useless. It doesn't appear to offer any benefit over the standard GOROOT.\r\n\r\nMaybe more clarification could be added that I didn't think of.",
