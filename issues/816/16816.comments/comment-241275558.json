	"body": "That would work for now, adding the constants manually to a new file `types_linux_arm.go`. But since `types_linux.go` contains the `FADV_*` constants, the next time `mkall.sh` is run for/on Linux/arm, they will also be written to `ztypes_linux_arm.go` and the code won't compile any more.\r\n\r\nIn order to mitigate this, the constants need to be removed from `types_linux.go` (the \"template\") and `ztypes_*.go`.\r\n\r\nI'd really like to solve my problem here, but I don't that this is a good idea.\r\n\r\nHow is `mkall.sh` supposed to work? Is it required to execute it on the target platform?\r\n\r\nIf I understood @ianlancetaylor in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15114#issuecomment-207676930 correctly, rebuilding the machine generated files produces many unrelated changes (which confirms my observations).",
