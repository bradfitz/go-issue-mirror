Replace the following with s[0] = 'b':\r\ns := \"rob\"\r\nb := []byte(s)\r\nb[0] = 'b'\r\ns = string(b)\r\nThis can be extended to a general ToUpper kind of loop, so looks useful.\r\n2. When you do:\r\ns += \"\\n\"\r\nIf runtime sees that there is an unused space in the string buffer of s, then it will just mutate it by appending \\n to it.\r\n\r\nDo you want to say that they are prohibited by the spec?...",
