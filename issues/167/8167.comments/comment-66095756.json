The encoder does\nnot know about them and may step on you (or vice versa). If you want to put the name\nspace definition in an outer element, the easiest thing to do is to use it in an\nattribute on that element: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/2-Y-CrhaP7\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/2-Y-CrhaP7\u003c/a\u003e, which will let the\nEncoder define it instead.\n\nThe test program in the initial report may be just invalid for trying to define an\nattribute named xmlns:l. Perhaps we should disallow all attributes named xmlns:* in a\nfuture version of Go. Not for 1.4 though.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.5**, removed **release-go1.4**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
