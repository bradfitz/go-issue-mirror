	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ntip\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nUbuntu 16.04\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\nReviewing performance for bytes functions, saw very poor performance on bytes.Compare.\r\n\r\nThe asm code for bytes.Compare loops through the compare buffers, loads and compares a single byte at a time, which is especially slow on ppc64x as buffers are longer.  The performance can be improved by checking lengths and using more efficient code sequences, such as doubleword loads and compares where possible.\r\n\r\n",
