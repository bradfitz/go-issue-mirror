	"body": "http://play.golang.org/p/67oKm8TFcm\r\n\r\nWhen I pass the URL in the playground into the http transport, it will call .RequestURI() and do a GET http://foo/bar%2f, while what I actually wanted was GET //foo/bar%2f. It looks like there is no possible way to construct a URL that will query for //foo/bar%2f.\r\n\r\nNot quite sure how to distinguish between the case of Opaque containing a qualified URI and an unqualified one starting with //. Does it make sense to look at the host part after the // and see if it matches what's in Host?",
