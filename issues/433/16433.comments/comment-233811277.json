Useful for error checks but not the way you want your data to be represented in the long term.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to define a new method, along the lines of `UnmarshalJSON`, that takes an offset as an argument.  That lets the user of the package choose how to handle the offset.\r\n\r\nEither way it's not clear to me this is worth the additional complexity in the standard library package.",
