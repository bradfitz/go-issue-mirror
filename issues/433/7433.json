	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eFrom golang-dev:\n\nBefore the 1.3 release, could the documentation be improved on RunParallel (and probably\nby extension SetParallel). I was looking at it today and I am confused on the intended\nusage.\n\nFor my case, I believe I don't need to use them, but I don't think the documentation for\nRunParallel and SetParallel gives a good enough sense for when they should be used.\nRunParallel says \u0026quot;It creates multiple goroutines and distributes b.N iterations\namong them\u0026quot;. Is the purpose to make the benchmark go faster by executing it\nconcurrently? Is the point to measure how concurrently executing processes interact with\none another? In addition to an answer to that question, it would be great to add more\nprose explaining the kinds of benchmarks where one would want to use SetParallelism and\nRunParallel. All SetParallelism says is that you shouldn't do it if you are CPU-bound.\nAdding text like \u0026quot;SetParallelism is useful, say, to measure the memory used by\nspawning many worker goroutines\u0026quot; (assuming that's correct).\u003c/pre\u003e",
