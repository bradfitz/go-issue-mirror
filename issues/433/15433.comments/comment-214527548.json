The Debian package `golang-go` ships only the static variants of the standard and runtime libraries, which are installed in `/usr/lib/go`. Compiling with `-buildmode=pie` requires the shared variants, however, which are not available; hence `go install` builds and tries to install these, which (rightly so) fails due to permissions.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the recommended way to install the Go compiler including both static and position-independent shared variants of the standard and runtime libraries? Debian uses `src/make.bash` for installation, but simply passing `GO_LDFLAGS=-buildmode=pie` does not seem to work.\r\n\r\n",
