The `net/http.*Server` does not have a way to close all open connections and does not even track the currently-open connections. Doing so would involve a new map and mutex, which is a cost everybody would have to pay for a little-used feature. It's unclear whether it should be opt-in, but that's kinda gross.\r\n",
