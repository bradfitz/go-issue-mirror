In your provided case, if you add the leading slash when setting u.Path it works\nfine. I've attached a proposed fix for the issue in url.go, as well as a source file\nthat shows which cases work and which do not.  I can push up a CL if there's interest.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5927/1/slash.go\"\u003eslash.go\u003c/a\u003e (338 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5927/1/urlfix.diff\"\u003eurlfix.diff\u003c/a\u003e (423 bytes)",
