	"body": "\u003e there is very little reason for Go to load shell32.dll to begin with. With some small changes we can eliminate that and at least one other DLL; this has the advantage of significantly improving the launch performance of Go processes on Windows. I will open a separate issue for that soon and provide some fixes I've prepared.\r\n\r\nPlease do. Thank you.\r\n(We, obviously, won't be able to change anything until after go1.7 is released).\r\n\r\nAlex",
