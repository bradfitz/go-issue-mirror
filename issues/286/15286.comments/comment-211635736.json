	"body": "Thanks bradfitz, alexbrainman, and rsc for the quick and helpful response on this. Alex -- I think there is a small problem with my proposal, but see below for an alternative that should be simpler anyway.\r\n\r\nDocker is working around this for now by rolling back to Go 1.5.3 when building for Windows. This takes the pressure off getting a fix into Go, but of course is not ideal in the long term. I believe we can move to Golang 1.6.x for Docker when building on Windows -- Docker for Linux is stuck on 1.5.x due to some net/http compatibility issues that do not apply for Windows: https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/20865.\r\n\r\nFor Nano Server RTM, we may be able to fix this in the OS, but given our release timelines this will add some complexity that the OS team would like to avoid. We'd like you to consider a fix in Go 1.6.2 as an alternative. *Edit*: We are evaluating solutions to determine the simplest working one; I'll post back with updates when I have them.",
