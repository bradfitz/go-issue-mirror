The change was motivated by a desire to reach *more* Chinese uses, not to discriminate against them.\r\n\r\nQuoting @jbuberel replying to @minux from [the original change](https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/14190/):\r\n\r\n\u003e \u003e Why do we block sharing requests from Chinese users?\r\nIs there a policy for this? Thanks.\r\n\u003e \u003e And I think the reason Chinese users are not able\r\nto access *.golang.org is not due to IP based\r\nblocking at Google's side. Each and every one of\r\nGoogle's public IP is being black-holed by a\r\nfamous firewall.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e You are correct in that Chinese users are unable to access *.golang.org sites because those network blocks have been firewalled by the GFC. However, Google does have several network blocks that have not yet been black-holed from which the *.golang.org services can be served. \r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e But in order for that to happen, we are required to ensure that we do not permit the *.golang.org sites to be used for creating User Generated Content by Chinese internet users in accordance with those laws. And the Go Playground was highlighted as a method of creating User Generated Content that could get the sites banned explicitly. \r\n\r\nI hope we can agree that it is better for Chinese users to be able to access golang.org, even if that means they can't share or retrieve shared playground snippets.
