Bugs are inevitable.\n\nWe are committed to not using bash, nor any of cygwin,\non Windows. I rewrote the bash files in batch for exactly\nthat reason, and Brad is rewriting the test/run script in Go.\nTrying to keep the Windows port of bash happy is\nnot worth the trouble.\n\nWhat does uname print on Windows?  We should put\na check in all.bash to print an error and exit on Windows.\nThey should use all.bat.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-go1**, **go1-must**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to **builder@golang.org**._",
