Literals are\n\"homeless\".\n\nHowever, the legal composite literal address taking syntax `foo := \u0026T{whatever}` is an\nexception. It's a handy shortcut for\n\n    foo = new(T); foo = whatever\n\nThe difference to your proposal is that this is allowed only for _named types_. AFAICS,\nallowing the same for anonymous type would introduce a new ambiguity to the grammar. I\nsuppose that's the reason why the \u0026T{} is an \"exception\" and not a general concept.\n\n#WorkingAsIntended\n\nPS: Please send language _proposals_ to golang-nuts as the first option; to be discussed\nthere before optionally entering the issue tracker as an agreed on change.\u003c/pre\u003e",
