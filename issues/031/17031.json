	"body": "For arrays [N]T where T is not a pure memory type, we currently generate separate algorithms for each distinct value of N.  Instead, we could emit simple stub algs that load N into a register/argument, and then jump to a common []T implementation.\r\n\r\nUnclear if this shows up often enough in practice to be beneficial though.\r\n\r\nRelated #17029.",
