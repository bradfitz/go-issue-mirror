Thus, should vendor be treated in similar ways to internal?\r\n\r\nAs it currently is, the following program compiles under go1.6beta2 (with the vendor experiment on):\r\n```go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport \"vendor/golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack\"\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\thpack.NewEncoder(nil)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this expected behavior? It seems kind of odd that I can import hpack as part of the \"standard\" library.\r\n\r\nThis is related to #13961 and #13929.",
