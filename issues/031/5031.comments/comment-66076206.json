Trailing commas are always allowed in comma-separated list,\nand in this example the trailing comma inhibits the insertion of a semicolon at the end,\nbecause a semicolon after a comma is never useful. In contrast, a semicolon after a\nstring is sometimes useful, like in:\n\nx := \"hello, world\";\n\nThe semicolon insertion rules are not sensitive to parse state, in order to keep the\nrules simple and to avoid the truly magical behavior people associate with JavaScript's\nsemicolon insertion. In particular they are not sensitive to whether the parser is in\nthe middle of a parenthesized list (in fact, some parenthesized lists can have\nsemicolons; think about import or var blocks). \n\nSo to avoid the semicolon, insert the comma.\u003c/pre\u003e",
