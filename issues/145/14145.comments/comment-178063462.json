	"body": "To be very precise, the \"issue\" is that Go, by way of its asn1 package, only supports the stricter/subset \"DER\"/\"Distinguished Encoding Rules\" and not the superset \"BER\"/\"Basic Encoding Rules\", impeding interoperability as both are valid asn1 encodings.\r\n\r\nQuoted from the latest version of the asn1 package (see https://github.com/golang/go/blob/7f96e266ec684943acfc1164a18d2cf005e03ef6/src/encoding/asn1/asn1.go#L5-L6):\r\n\r\n\u003e // Package asn1 implements parsing of DER-encoded ASN.1 data structures,\r\n\u003e // as defined in ITU-T Rec X.690.\r\n\r\nI have tried to address this on the Paramiko side (see https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/pull/572), but was led to believe the problem would be shortly addressed in a different manner, which I will re-engage based on this new/renewed interest.  Regardless of Paramiko, it would improve Go's general crypto interoperability to support BER (ie Postel's Law).",
