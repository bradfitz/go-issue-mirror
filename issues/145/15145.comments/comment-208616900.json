	"body": "I don't see anything obviously wrong from the code.\r\n\r\nThis is the autogenerated code for `(*rwTestConn).RemoteAddr`.  It is autogenerated because `rwTestConn` contains an embedded type `noopConn` that provides the `RemoteAddr` implementation.  The stub basically does:\r\n```\r\nfunc (x *rwTestConn) RemoteAddr() net.Addr {\r\n    return (\u0026x.noopConn).RemoteAddr()\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe call out to `noopConn.RemoteAddr` is inlined so you don't see the actual call.\r\n\r\nIt's weird that the error is \"index out of range\".  There are no bounds checks in this stub.\r\nOne possibility is that with -race we call racereadrange with a size of 0 (for the read of `noopConn`, which is a `struct{}`).  Maybe race is confused by zero size? Seems unlikely, but @dvyukov just in case.\r\n\r\nThe only non-race thing it calls is `convT2I`, which is basically malloc+memmove.  Hard to see how a bounds check could fail down there.  It might be helpful to get a `GOTRACEBACK=system` trace for this failure.\r\n\r\nI don't know what might be windows-specific about this.  I'm going to try to reproduce on linux overnight.",
