Still I personally rather not have this functionality in go test tool (others may disagree):\r\n- the first version of the test from your proposal is actually shorter, more explicit and understandable without any explanations\r\n- the proposed functionality provides an alternative way to implement something that is already possible, it doesn't enable anything new\r\n- it requires more conventions to know about and remember in order to understand Go tests\r\n",
