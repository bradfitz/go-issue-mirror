Naturally it should be decided by someone who submits a patch; they're\njust notes.\n\nThe data hiding is a *real* PITA, especially as the language is new, many things are\nhidden so that rewriting or patching entire core libraries is necessary to expose\nthings. That's a separate complaint.\n\nIt would be great if the socket handle was just exposed (and the dangers of abusing it\nmade clear in the documentation, naturally). I don't really want to duplicate it; my end\ngoal is to get at a `syscall.Handle` for the socket to set the TTL.\u003c/pre\u003e",
