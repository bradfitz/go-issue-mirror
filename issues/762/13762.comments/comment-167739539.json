	"body": "@mikioh I saw #10527, but I think this is a little different. #10527 is basically that the socket isn't closed since `Accept` has a reference to the underlying socket. However, the `Accept` should return an error when it is scheduled since the socket is closed.\r\n\r\nIn this case, `Accept` is *not* returning an error after the `Close` call. If you run the repro code, you'll see that it only fails on Linux and not OSX, so I'm not sure if this is a platform independent issue.",
