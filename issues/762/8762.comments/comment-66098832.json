JS, CSS, or HTML seems a\nreasonable level of granularity.\n\nI'm concerned that if we try to expose the whole context object publicly, then we risk\nconfusing users, expand the API unnecessarily, and possibly paint ourselves into a\ncorner should the languages change in radical ways (string templates in JS) or some\nweird zero-day arrives.\u003c/pre\u003e",
