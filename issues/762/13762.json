	"body": "I've written a repro test here:\r\nhttps://github.com/prashantv/listener-repro/blob/master/main.go\r\n\r\nIt basically does the following:\r\n - Start a listener\r\n - Create `connectionsBeforeClose` connections to the listener (which should succeed)\r\n - Close the listener\r\n - Create another connection to the listener\r\n\r\nOn the listener side, I expect to receive at most `connectionsBeforeClose` successful connections. Any extra connections causes the `runTest` method to return an error.\r\n\r\nThis works as expected on OSX, but on Linux, it seems to receive a successful connection after the listener has been closed.\r\n\r\nSome things I noticed:\r\n - If `connectionsBeforeClose` is set to 0, then no unexpected connections are made after the listener is closed\r\n - The issue also disappears if I `enableSleep`\r\n\r\nI would expect that a Listener will not accept any further socket attempts after `Close` has returned.",
