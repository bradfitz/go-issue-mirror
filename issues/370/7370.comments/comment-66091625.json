Removing directories from the list in run.go\ncause failures in other ways -- panics, deadlocks, faults. It appears that some code,\nsomewhere, is now having a fun romp through other people's memory, unfettered from the\ncruel shackles of null termination.\n\nIf anyone wants to take over, let me know. Otherwise, I'll keep poking at this for a bit\nlonger.\u003c/pre\u003e",
