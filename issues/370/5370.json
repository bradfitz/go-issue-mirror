	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe compiler is not very smart about compiling away closures.  The following function\nneedlessly allocates a closure at runtime\n\nfunc main() {\n  s := \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n  f := func () { println(s) }\n  g(f)\n}\n\nThis example should succumb to closure analysis.  The closure should be eliminated at\ncompile time and replaced by an ordinary function.\u003c/pre\u003e",
