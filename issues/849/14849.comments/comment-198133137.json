This means that v41 is not replaced by v30 which means fuse cannot collapse the branch.\r\n\r\nStupid jumps and empty branches after trim are a sign of missed opportunities for fuse.\r\n\r\nI'm going to submit a fix tomorrow, but if anyone wants to take care make sure the proper canonicalization rule is added: (AddPtr x const) -\u003e (AddPtr const x).\r\n\r\n",
