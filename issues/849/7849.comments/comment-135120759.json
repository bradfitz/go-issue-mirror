I think the solution would be just adding support for if_msghdrl into x/sys/unix and internal/syscall packages. It provides TLV-style data access view (at last) so we can make a type like ``` type IfMsghdrl struct { FixedHeaderFields; Len int; Data []byte }``` for freebsd10 and beyond without worrying about future ABI changes.",
