	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhile adding syscall.Unsetenv, I notice that plan9's environment handling in pkg syscall\nseems inconsistent.\n\nIt sometimes does copyenv, but sometimes not. And things like Getenv can lazily populate\nit. It seems like there are possible bugs with different orderings, but I didn't look\ntoo hard.\n\nTalking to Russ, he points out that plan9 processes can share environments, so keeping a\ncached copy of anything in syscall is probably wrong.\n\nI will do the bare minimum to keep plan9 compiling, but somebody should probably own\ncleaning this up.\u003c/pre\u003e",
