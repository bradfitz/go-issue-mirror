Please change the IP address of golang.org and\nmake it ioslated from Google's IP. The firewall usually doesn't ban the pure technical\nsite, golang.org might be banned together with the google.com.\n\nIn a world, all of the Google's productions have been banned by the firewall, the go\nteam should change a IP which is not sensitive.\u003c/pre\u003e",
