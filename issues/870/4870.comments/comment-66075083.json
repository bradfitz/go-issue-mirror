I'd much rather find a mechanism that doesn't require\nlast-minute tweaking of the tree.\n\nHere is an alternative:\n\n1. Move go/types to the go.exp subrepo.\n2. Arrange so that cmd/vet has all its references to go/types in one file\nthat can be dropped from the build. Mark that file with // +build gotypes.\n3. People who want the typed vet run 'go install -tags gotypes cmd/vet'.\n\nIt also gives people who have Go 1.1 and want to try go/types a way to do\nso.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
