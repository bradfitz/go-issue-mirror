The Enable call only\n   // works from main.main.  If go/types is used without being enabled,\n   // it panics.\n   exp.Enable(\"go/types\")\n\n   foo.Something() // ... which uses go/types. But foo can't Enable itself. Only main can.\n}\n\nBy making main declare that, it prevents:\n\n  user A's main -\u003e user B's foo -\u003e go/types 1.1 (works)\n  user A's main -\u003e user B's foo -\u003e go/types 1.2 (explodes)\n\n... and surprising user A, who didn't know how user B's foo was implemented.\u003c/pre\u003e",
