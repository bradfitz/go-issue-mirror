I have now commented out some code, so that the package can be built without this\nso-file (see robot/sensors/lidar/driver). This version is tagged \"issue5094\" in the\nrepo. I'm sorry i didn't think about this the first time. Apart from that, there\nshouldn't be any \"magic\"; the \"robot\" and \"hectormapping\" folders are located in the\nsame \"src\" folder at GOPATH.\n\nFurther, following suggestions at Stack Overflow\n(\u003ca href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15544601/nosplit-stack-overflow-when-building-go-project)\"\u003ehttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/15544601/nosplit-stack-overflow-when-building-go-project)\u003c/a\u003e,\nI have now installed the tip version of Go. I'm happy to report that the tip version\ndoes not have the \"nosplit stack overflow\" problem!\n\nIt may have given me another problem, as it now won't compile with the .so-file\nmentioned above (\"malformed pe file: unexpected flags for PE section .idata$2\"). But\nthis is likely unrelated to this issue report.\n\nThank you!\n\nMikael\u003c/pre\u003e",
