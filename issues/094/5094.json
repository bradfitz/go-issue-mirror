I don't know if this is a\nhint at where the bug might arise.)\n\nThis happened after I moved some code to create more logical and reusable packages. If I\nremove all references to the \u0026quot;hectormapping\u0026quot; package, the program will build\nsuccessfully. \u0026quot;go build hectormapping\u0026quot; also works.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1.

(run 'go version')\ngo version go1.0.3\u003c/pre\u003e",
