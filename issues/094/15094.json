What did you do?\r\n\r\nI have several packages in GOPATH/src, some mine, some from other people. I run the Godoc server locally (using the installed shortcut) and browse the packages.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nI expect to see only the standard library in the \"Standard library\" section, and GOPATH packages in its own section (possibly in Other packages)\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nThere is a first section called \"Standard library\". However, all available packages (from the standard library and at GOPATH/src) are listed here, mixed. Later, there is a section called \"Other packages\" with two subsections (Sub-repositories and Community) but no packages from GOPATH listed there.",
