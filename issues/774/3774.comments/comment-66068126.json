In the general case it might be left holding locks, not freeing memory, etc. \nI don't think it's a good idea to simply assume that the non-Go code is OK after a\nsynchronous signal and to just keep running the program.  I think we could assume that\nit is OK if we throw a signal, since that will run any destructors; I don't think we\ncould assume it is OK if we don't do that.\u003c/pre\u003e",
