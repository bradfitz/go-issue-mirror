I am not sure what triggered the flakiness (probably what 144120043\nfixed), but we have a panic running a deferred function calling Goexit, and then goexit\nincorrectly also calls the deferred function, which (for the same reason as last time)\ncalls Goexit, and so on.\n\nThere should be a real test of this, and Goexit should be updated to skip over started\ndefers. In fact I think it should probably clean them up the same way that Panic does.\nWithout looking carefully I'm not sure exactly how much of the gopanic loop needs to be\ncopied into Goexit.\n\nKeith, interested?\u003c/pre\u003e",
