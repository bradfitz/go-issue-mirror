	"body": "While reading the source code of many packages lately I  stumbled a lot over the following function declaration:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc stringInList(list []string, str string) bool {\r\n\tfor _, val := range list {\r\n\t\tif val == str {\r\n\t\t\treturn true\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have the feeling that searching a slice of strings for the first occurrence of a string is a very common need and might be a good addition to the standard library.\r\n\r\nI would propose the following function for the strings package:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc ListIndex(list []string, str string) int {\r\n\tfor i, val := range list {\r\n\t\tif val == str {\r\n\t\t\treturn i\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn -1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know adding stuff to the standard library is a big thing, but I had to give it a least a try. ;)",
