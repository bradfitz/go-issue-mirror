My client library receives an initial Settings frame with SettingMaxConcurrentStreams = 1 and once the connection is authenticated, receives SettingMaxConcurrentStreams = 500.\r\n\r\nlogged via: https://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/http2/transport.go#L1735\r\n\r\nMy initial thought was to gain access to the settings data via some API (possibly like httptrace?). Then I could manage the number of goroutines sending requests. \r\n\r\nBlocking all the requests currently in flight could actually work better though. I'd be curious to try it out.",
