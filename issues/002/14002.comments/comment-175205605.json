	"body": "OK, well, the fact is that zone identifiers are allowed to have spaces, and this code was trying to make sure they were minimally escaped. Since you can't have a space in a URL, the space must be escaped. This code didn't allow that, and now it does. So I think everything here is in order.\r\n\r\nThere's some question about whether zone identifiers in practice use spaces, but it appears that at least in Go programs on Windows they do. Maybe that's a mistake, or maybe not, but it's too late in the release cycle to make a fundamental change like that in package net. The acceptance of %20 in the zone identifier is trivial, clearly safe, and consistent with RFCs. (The code in question was actually  being stricter than the RFCs and still is.)\r\n\r\nIf someone wants to open a separate bug, for Go 1.7, about maybe using %1 instead of \"%Windows Ethernet Adapter\" or whatever, that's fine.\r\n",
