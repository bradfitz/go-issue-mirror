	"title": "Proposal: Make x/crypto/scrypt API match x/crypto/bcrypt",
	"body": "*Summary*: The x/crypto/scrypt package has a very simple API that puts the onus of figuring out salt generation and sensible N/r/p values on the package user. We should attempt to mirror the bcrypt packages' API and provide sensible defaults.\r\n\r\n*Details*:\r\n\r\n* Add a `GenerateFromPassword` function that generates output in the form `N$r$p$salt$dk` (noting that there is no 'standard' for scrypt here)\r\n* Add a `CompareHashAndPassword` function\r\n* Add a `Cost` function that can return the cost of a given output (i.e. for determining whether to upgrade or not)\r\n* Provide sensible default params that provide reasonable values of N, r, p and document why/when you may wish to change them.\r\n* Potentially provide a way to automatically determine values of N, r, p given memory (MB) and time (ms) constraints.\r\n\r\nNote that I've done most of this work in https://godoc.org/github.com/elithrar/simple-scrypt and would seek to bring most of this in.\r\n\r\n",
