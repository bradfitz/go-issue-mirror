If you apply attached diff to 620fea2e0220, you\nwill see some debug output as well as required source changes. Perhaps you can give me\npointers at what I could do next.\n\nAlternatively you could try and debug the problem on our windows-amd64 builder, if you\nlike. Just let me know.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5971/6/a.diff\"\u003ea.diff\u003c/a\u003e (18183 bytes)",
