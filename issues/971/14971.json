	"body": "Per [RFC 6960](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960#page-15), ResponseData includes ResponderID. It's useful for clients to be able to validate ResponderID against the issuer certificate they are expecting. The `Response` type should include this field (which may be composite), and ParseResponse should fill it and validate it if provided with an issuer certificate.",
