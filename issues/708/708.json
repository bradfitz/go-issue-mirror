Rationale: (a) This is\nquite a heavy restriction of my freedom to choose variable names that are\nthe most appropriate in my context \u0026amp; programming style; (b) it's not well\ncompatible with the freedom to use UTF-8: there are many scripts that don't\nhave a full fledged lower case / upper case distinction; (c) what if I want\nto change visibility - I have to change every single occurence of the\nvariable. Why not use a keyword like \u0026quot;export\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;public\u0026quot; ? Little\nmore\ntyping, but huge gain in flexibility and readability.\u003c/pre\u003e",
