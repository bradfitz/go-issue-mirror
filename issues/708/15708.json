	"body": "My reading of the Go spec is that this is valid:\r\n\r\n    package p\r\n    \r\n    type S1 struct { *S2 }\r\n    type S2 struct { *S1 }\r\n\r\n    func (*S1) M() {}\r\n\r\n    var _ = S1.M\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n  1. Because of `func (*S1) M() {}`, `M` is a member of `*S1`'s method set.\r\n  2. Because of the `*S1` embedding into `S2`, `M` is also a member of `S2` and `*S2`'s method sets.\r\n  3. Because of the `*S2` embedding into `S1`, `M` should also be a member of `S1`'s method set.\r\n\r\nHowever, cmd/compile, gccgo, and gotype all reject it.\r\n\r\n/cc @griesemer @ianlancetaylor ",
