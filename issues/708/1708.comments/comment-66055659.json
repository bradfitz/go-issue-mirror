But if it's a const, '2.0 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; ui' is a standalone\nexpression, therefore compiler must be able to evaluate it in place to a certain value.\nAnd gc compiler compiles this code just fine (as it should):\n    var ui uint = 5;\n    var a int = 2.0 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; ui;\n\nAlthough it is confusing, very confusing.. :(\u003c/pre\u003e",
