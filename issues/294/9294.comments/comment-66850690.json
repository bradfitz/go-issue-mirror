Do you want to add something to cmd/cgo\ndocumentation?\nAlong the lines of: if the exported function is used within a Go file, then\nit's not possible\nto use the _cgo_export.h header to get the correct declaration. One way to\ndo is to\nuse go build -work and then look up and copy the correct declaration from\n_cgo_export.h\nto the cgo preamble.\n\nThis solution is still fragile, as the user might also need to copy out the\ndefinition of\nGoInt8, ..., GoString, GoInterface and GoSlice to the preamble. And that\nwill prevent\nus from changing any of those definitions.",
