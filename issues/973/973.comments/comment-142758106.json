	"body": "@brendensoares @robpike mentioned later: \"Therefore the narrower case is explicitly permitted, but the general case is still not.\" Per the spec.\r\n\r\nSo there's no reason to make any spec changes. If there's no concrete issue filed (proposal, or bug) it's unlikely that it will get any attention. We do make minor spec adjustments, either to clarify a situation which is not well documented, or to remove an inconsistency (one part of the spec says one thing, another part says something else). In extremely rare cases we loosen the spec (e.g., most recently we allowed the omission of the key type for elements of map composite literals if the key was a composite literal as well.\r\n\r\nThis is not one of those cases. It's been fairly uncontroversial, the compilers all agree, and the spec seems reasonably clear.\r\n\r\nHope that helps. And again, please move this discussion elsewhere if you are still not satisfied, or follow the proposal process. Thanks.",
