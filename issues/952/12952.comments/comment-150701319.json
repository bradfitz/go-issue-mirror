Any objections to that?\r\n\r\nRationale: Currently it's rather unfortunate that Gerrit sorts os1_\\*.go files together, then os2_\\*.go files, etc.  That makes it more annoying (at least IMO) to review CLs like https://golang.org/cl/16176, where it would be nicer to see the os_foo.go and os1_foo.go changes together.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, CL 16176 is the only pending CL that touches the os\\*.go files, but I have a couple more similar cleanups in mind.",
