The code is loading a 32-bit value, which on ARM may only be loaded from an\naligned address.  So the bug is that for some reason on tip the value is not being\nstored at an aligned address.\n\nI'm not completely sure, but I think the right place to fix this is the floating point\nconstant code in obj5.c, obj6.c, obj8.c, and objfile.c.  It calls adduint{32,64} without\nenforcing any sort of alignment.  But there doesn't seem to be any general alignment\nsupport in liblink.\u003c/pre\u003e",
