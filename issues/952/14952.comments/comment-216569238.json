	"body": "Where this gets interesting is with custom error pages.  We have a project that was already doing some validation of its own and then returning not just a 400 status, but an error page with details (similar to what's suggested in #10123).  Now with Go 1.6, the request doesn't even reach the handler infrastructure, so we don't have the ability to return a custom error page.  It seems like there are two solutions to this:\r\n\r\n1. Allow user of http.Server to disable certain validation as this ticket suggests\r\n\r\n2. Allow user of http.Server to register custom error handlers for any validations that are performed\r\n\r\n1 seems easier to implement initially and more broadly applicable.  2 seems more convenient for the specific case of displaying custom error pages.\r\n\r\n@bradfitz What do you think?\r\n\r\ncc: @uaalto",
