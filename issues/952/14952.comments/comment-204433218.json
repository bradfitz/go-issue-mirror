Because it is a commercial product it is not easily modified unlike a custom build application.  The Server is a Java Tomcat Server.\r\n\r\nThe javacript in this commercial application is obviously not supposed to send `//foo` requests.  But, the desire here is that regardless of this client invalid request we'd like to write a transparent proxy using go http that doesn't munge a request like this.",
