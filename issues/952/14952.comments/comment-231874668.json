	"body": "@bradfitz This is the bug we were just talking about.  Basically our main use for this is that we have an HTTP proxy server that mimics an unconfigured Apache server under certain circumstances.  In the case of a 400 bad request, Apache has specific HTTP headers that it sends when responding, as well as specific HTML body content.  We'd like to be able to continue responding with these.\r\n\r\nThis may be a slightly different use case than for this original bug, namely we're not interested in being able to handle and process bad requests, we just want to have control over the specifics of the response.  However, if it was possible to let these bad requests just fall through to a regular http.Handler, that would allow us to do what we need.",
