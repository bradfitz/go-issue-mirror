	"body": "@bradfitz I believe the root problem is that when a client requests `GET //foo`, as it passes through the go written transparent proxy it is transformed to `GET http://foo` which as it passes onto the final destination server becomes a 404 since the destination server was expecting `//foo` or `/foo` but not `http://foo`.  You can see it @crhino playground example that what the go request handler thinks it got a request for `http://foo` instead of `//foo` that was originally sent.\r\n\r\nI think you're simple example only deals with generating the request.  I think the problem is on the go request handler side not the go client request side.\r\n\r\nDoes that help?\r\n\r\nMike",
