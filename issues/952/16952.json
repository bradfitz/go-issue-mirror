	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\ngo1.7\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nn/a.\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nSee https://play.golang.org/p/pWT6IMacni.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nExpected the `Response.ContentLength` to be set. Since a bytes.Buffer is used for recording the response body, the content length can be set using Buffer.Len.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nAs seen in https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/http/httptest/recorder.go#L143-L188, the `Response.ContentLength` is never set.\r\n\r\nI could write a patch if it would be accepted.",
