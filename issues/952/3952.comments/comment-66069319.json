For example, it looks like this on linux:\n\ntype Stat_t struct {\n    Dev       uint64\n    X__pad1   uint16\n    Pad_cgo_0 [2]byte\n    X__st_ino uint32\n    Mode      uint32\n    Nlink     uint32\n    Uid       uint32\n    Gid       uint32\n    Rdev      uint64\n    X__pad2   uint16\n    Pad_cgo_1 [2]byte\n    Size      int64\n    Blksize   int32\n    Blocks    int64\n    Atim      Timespec\n    Mtim      Timespec\n    Ctim      Timespec\n    Ino       uint64\n}\n\nDo you want it all on windows? I do not think so.\n\n\u003e It looks like FileInfo.Sys() from a FileInfo returned by os.Stat could easily ...\n\nLets not design things here. Just tell use what you need. What is your problem?\n\nOnce we know what your problem is, then, perhaps, we can decide how to help you.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
