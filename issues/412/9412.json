	"body": "After updating to 1.4, I wanted to check out the sample Android applications. At first, `go get golang.org/x/mobile/example/basic` failed, as it couldn't find `EGL/egl.h` and `GLES2/gl2.h` (solution: install `libgles2-mesa-dev` and `libegl1-mesa-dev`, after which `go get` succeeds). \r\n\r\nAfter installing these, I attempted to set up cross-compilation for the android/arm platform. For convenience, I used [davecheney's helper script](https://github.com/davecheney/golang-crosscompile/blob/master/crosscompile.bash) (it does not include `android/arm`, so I added it manually). Using this script, I am able to build Go for all the platforms *except* `android/arm`, which gives the following error:\r\n\r\n`gcc: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-marm’`\r\n\r\nHowever, `freebsd/arm` and `linux/arm` succeed with no such issue. (Attempting to compile the sample Android application fails with the same error message, for what it's worth).\r\n\r\nI initially thought this was an issue with Debian (Wheezy) packages being out of date, but I run into the same issues on Arch as well (both machines are x86_64, and both have the Android SDK installed).",
