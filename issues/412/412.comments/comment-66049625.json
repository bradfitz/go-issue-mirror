It destroys the strict \nseparation between implementation and interface. Once the feature is available, it \nwill be (mis)used, and the resulting code will become less flexible because such \ninterfaces can only be satisfied by struct with the respective field. We had discussed \nthis feature very early on in the language design and decided against it.\n\nA better approach is to use accessor functions (and one might argue that Go should \nprovide automatic accessors, but that is a different discussion).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
