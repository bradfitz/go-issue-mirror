Package reflect's current API makes it difficult to extend to support distinguishing them: we can't add new fields to `reflect.StructField` without breaking backwards compatibility, so we would need to do something clunky like a `FieldHasTag(i int) bool` method to `reflect.Type`.\r\n\r\nThere also seems to be little value in distinguishing them.  The conventional usage of struct tags involve key-value pairs, for which empty and absent tags can be treated identically anyway.",
