	"body": "Success! Here's what I had to do:\r\n\r\n1. Reinstall the NDK toolchain (perhaps it was stale before):  \r\n    `./android-ndk-r10c/build/tools/make-standalone-toolchain.sh --platform=android-21 --install-dir=$NDK_ROOT`\r\n\r\n2. `CC_FOR_TARGET` was indeed the key missing environment variable.\r\n\r\n`CC_FOR_TARGET=\"$NDK_ROOT/toolchain/arm-linux-androideabi/bin/gcc\" GOOS=android GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 ./make.bash`\r\n\r\n3. Edit `make.bash` in the project directory (not the one in `/usr/local/go/src`) to use the full path to `ndk-build`. (I think there is a $PATH issue here: while `ndk-build` is in the $PATH, if I didn't use the absolute path, it wouldn't look in the right directory for a number of .so files.)\r\n\r\nAfter that, it was able to build `./bin/nativeactivity-debug.apk`, which I've confirmed runs on my phone. \r\n\r\nThanks!",
