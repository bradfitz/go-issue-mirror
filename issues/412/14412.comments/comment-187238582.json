	"body": "@griesemer, thank you for clarifying. Perhaps this needs a documentation update, since the tabwriter documentation says this:\r\n\r\n\u003e The Writer treats incoming bytes as UTF-8 encoded text consisting of cells terminated by (horizontal or vertical) tabs or line breaks (newline or formfeed characters). Cells in adjacent lines constitute a column.\r\n\r\nCells can be terminated by line breaks; I'd think that the line breaks after the right-most column in my example code would have led tabwriter to interpret that last column as align-able.\r\n\r\nShould the documentation be updated to say that the cells can only be terminated by horizontal or vertical tabs? I might still be misinterpreting.",
