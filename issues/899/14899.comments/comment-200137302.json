	"body": "OK I figured out why the syscall is failing.  It's returning `EINVAL`, which according to the xnu source of `sigaction` is because it's being passed `SIGKILL`.\r\n\r\n```C\r\nif (signum \u003c= 0 || signum \u003e= NSIG ||\r\n\t    signum == SIGKILL || signum == SIGSTOP)\r\n\t\treturn (EINVAL);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason changing the flags on SIGKILL must cause `sigaction` to be called on it.  I still can't figure out why that is, but since the handler can't be changed anyway I don't need to set the flags on that one.",
