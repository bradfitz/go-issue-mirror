	"body": "One possibility would be to simply return from the Go signal handler, after restoring the old signal handler.  That should cause the instruction to be executed again, raising the signal again, this time invoking the old handler.  I'm not sure but it seems worth a try.\r\n\r\nBut a serious problem with that idea, or in general with any attempt to fix up the stack in the signal context, is that there would be no way to reinstall the Go signal handler if the program did not simply crash.  In this case, of course, it does crash, but in the general case the non-Go signal handler might handle the signal and continue executing.",
