Operations like `wg.Add`, `wg.Done` and creating many goroutines probably limit scalability and skew results.\r\n\r\nI think a better approach would be to use 1 reader and 1 writer goroutine and let RunParallel handle concurrency level for you. Also avoid using atomic operations and wait groups.\r\n\r\nAlso I want to point out that the following result:\r\n```\r\nBenchmarkLFChan         50000000               325 ns/op\r\nBenchmarkLFChan-4       50000000               270 ns/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nshows that the benchmarked operation became `270*4/325=3.3` times slower.",
