Delve compiles programs with optimizations disabled for this reason, however when it is debugging a binary compiled by other means this still becomes an issue. I'm certainly in favor of preferring DW_AT_start_scope over the DW_AT_decl_* attributes, should be more correct generally and save some space as well.\r\n\r\nAdditionally @ianlancetaylor and @aclements if the decision is made to move DWARF generation into the compiler I'm more than happy to help work on that, as it's something that I have a direct interest in improving.",
