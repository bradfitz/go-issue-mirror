	"body": "I was trying to use regexp to do some pattern matching with the or operator but I got some odd results. I have stripped out everything but the essentials to show the problem with my result.\r\n\r\nThis is my code:\r\n```golang\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport \"fmt\"\r\nimport \"regexp\"\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tauthRegexp := regexp.MustCompile(\"^token=(llll|(.+))$\")\r\n\tmatches := authRegexp.FindStringSubmatch(\"token=llll\")\r\n\tfmt.Println(\"MATCHES\", matches, len(matches))\r\n        // MATCHES [token=llll llll ] 3\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUrl: http://play.golang.org/p/nLtWQQgveY\r\n\r\nThe matches array has a length of 3, when I think it should have a length of 2. The last value is an empty string. I dont understand why it does this. Is this a golang bug? How do I submit golang bugs?",
