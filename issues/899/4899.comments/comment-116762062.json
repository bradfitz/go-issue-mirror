But being able to ask the runtime package to filter frames sounds useful in building a nice high level API here and might fit nicely in with the considerations in #11432. However, package name is probably not what we'd filter on. Helper functions can occur within the same package, within other packages, etc. The API style I propose (which might not be what we want) is to be able to mark a function as a helper function by making a call from within it. To implement that, you might need some opaque identifier for a frame that could be used later with the frame filter.",
