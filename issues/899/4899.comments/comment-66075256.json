The proposal in #19 differs from what Brad and Rob had in mind. Before\npolishing a CL to send, I'd like to get their input.\n\n2. The implementation. Using runtime.Func's Entry is a bit of a hack, and one that won't\nwork for closures, I think. (Maybe we don't care?) And I don't see another obvious way.\u003c/pre\u003e",
