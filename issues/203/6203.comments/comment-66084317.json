The Go runtime assumes that it creates the stacks,\nand it sets up the stack bounds to implement the split stack code.  When your code calls\nmakecontext, you start running on a different stack that Go does not know about,\nalthough you are still running in a thread that Go thinks it knows about.  The only\npossible result is complete confusion.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
