	"body": "by **junyer**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u0026gt; The standard package makefile rules in Make.pkg automate the\n\u0026gt; process of using cgo.  See $GOROOT/misc/cgo/stdio and\n\u0026gt; $GOROOT/misc/cgo/gmp for examples.\n\n`go build' just does it all automagically now, so the documentation (and the examples,\nmost probably) should be updated to reflect that.\n\nIncidentally, please document `CGO_CFLAGS' and `CGO_LDFLAGS' for the benefit of those\npeople using libraries such as LLVM, which has its own `llvm-config' tool.\u003c/pre\u003e",
