Contexts need to be passed explicitly. Automatic contexts leads to tons of problems of confusingly-annotated traces (as witnessed in C++ and Java code trying to use TLS), which is why goroutines don't have accessible ID numbers. This won't be added to Go as an automatic thing.\r\n\r\n\u003e I literally want to know what caused the errors now.\r\n\r\nModify the Go code and see. The error can only come from a few places.\r\n",
