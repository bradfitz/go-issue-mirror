	"body": "**What version of Go are you using (go version)?**\r\n\r\n1.5.3.\r\n\r\n**What operating system and processor architecture are you using?**\r\n\r\nLinux. AMD 64.\r\n\r\n**What did you do?**\r\n\r\nI'm using `httputil.ReverseProxy` to proxy to a host behind ELB, and I'm getting the errors \"http: proxy error: net/http: request canceled\" \u0026 \"http: proxy error: net/http: transport closed before response was received\" occationally. The line that printed the error is [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.5/src/net/http/httputil/reverseproxy.go#L196). And the error came from [`http.Transport.RoundTrip`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.5/src/net/http/httputil/reverseproxy.go#L194).\r\n\r\nAfter more digging, [the errors](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.5/src/net/http/transport.go#L1093-L1094) could come from a couple places in `http.Transport.RoundTrip`. I was trying to find a way to print the callstacks of the error from `http.Transport.RoundTrip` to understand why it was returned but there's currently no way to do so.\r\n\r\nDetails can be found in [this golang-nuts thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/apVfiayC01I).\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\n\r\nI would expect I could instrument a method of either application code or Go's standard library and find out the callstacks at runtime.\r\n\r\n**What did you see instead?**\r\n\r\nNo way to find out the callstack of a method from Go's stdlib. This is a feature request.",
