	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.5 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"darwin\"\r\nGOOS=\"darwin\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nLooked at: https://golang.org/src/crypto/elliptic/\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nA really easy to use implementation of p128\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nOnly p224 and p256\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIs there any reason why p128 is not implemented?  \r\n\r\nIf there is no strong reason against it, if I was to contribute p128 in my spare time would it be rejected for some reason such as \"It isn't cryptographically strong enough to be added into golang\"?\r\n\r\n",
