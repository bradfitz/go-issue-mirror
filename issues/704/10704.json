	"body": "The GCE implementation of BuildletPool's quota accounting is way too dumb \u0026 conservative.\r\n\r\nIf it counted better, it could push our quota limits a lot harder.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it could push things as hard as possible until it hit limits, learn the limits, and then count from there.\r\n\r\nOr it could poll quotas?  (is there an API?)\r\n\r\nCurrently we have quota for 200 CPUs (and N RAM and disk, etc) but we limit ourselves to 60 builds at once, just because we haven't done the work to count how much of resource $X each build uses.\r\n\r\n/cc @adg @crawshaw ",
