	"body": "Thanks.  Looking more closely, I guess the stack dump for running threads only happens when using GOTRACEBACK=crash.\r\n\r\nI see now that you have two running goroutines (28 and 69) and you also have two goroutines that are locked to threads (17 and 21).  That may account for the four threads permitted by GOMAXPROCS.  Unfortunately we don't really know what any of them are doing, except that 21 is running ensureSigM which ensures that signal masks are correct when using the os/signal package.",
