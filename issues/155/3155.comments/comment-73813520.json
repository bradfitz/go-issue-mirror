	"body": "The FLATE algorithm can also adjust its memLevel (the zlib name; compress/flate calls it hashBits). This also is important to be able to scale. Both of these are very important for reducing memory usage when dealing with many connections. See https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/DDz3-X1JNVI/vBdjTT1tvYoJ for more discussion. \r\n\r\nNote that these will impact compress/zlib, which currently has CINFO hardcoded as 0x78. That interface needs to support modifying window bits as well.\r\n\r\nIt may be helpful to make maxStoreBlockSize configurable as well. It currently allocates 64k per instance in the NoCompression case.\r\n\r\nServers implementing http2 and spdy can generate thousands or tens of thousands of long-lived zlib writers and readers, so minimizing memory usage can be critical.",
