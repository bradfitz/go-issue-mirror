What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOOS=windows\r\nGOARCH=amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nWhen using golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal the MakeRaw function for Windows modifies the state before returning it, despite the intent being to return the _original_ state so that it can be restored.\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/hc1ssZfv_o\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nSuccess\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nFAILURE\r\npanic: Expected \u0026{423} to equal ${416} but it does not!\r\n\u003ctiny stack trace from panic\u003e",
