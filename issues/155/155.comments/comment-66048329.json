And you are \nmaking it more difficult for developers to share code with each other. (I want to\npublish my UPnP \nimplementation, but I'm blocked in doing so by the 3 bugs in the net and HTTP code.)\n\nYour stated reason for keeping Send private is to make it easier for you to change the\nhttp API compatibly. But \ngiven that Response is already public, I can't imagine any significant change to the\nhttp API that wouldn't \nbreak existing clients.\n\nAnd given that Go changes incompatibly every month anyway, I see little benefit to\nkeeping the http code \nespecially stable.\n\nI expect that you will give in to temptation and change http incompatibly before go\nbecomes API stable, so all \nyou're doing now is making the http library less useful.\n\nThe alternative is for developers to start maintaining an \"extended\" version of the net\nand http libraries, that \nhas these additional features.\n\nIs that what you recommend?\u003c/pre\u003e",
