All of the fixes I tested were entirely local to cmd/internal/obj/x86/obj6.go, which doesn't seem substantially altered in the dev.ssa branch.\r\n\r\n(Also, FWIW, my fear is gofmt.after3 could result in worse instruction caching, because the morestack-call instructions will appear in the middle of functions with multiple RETs, whereas at least with gofmt.after2 they'll stay out of the way with other unlikely/cold instructions.  But performance predictions/measurements aren't my strong point.)",
