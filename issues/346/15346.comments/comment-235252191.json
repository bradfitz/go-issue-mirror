	"body": "Sorry to resurface this. Editors are integrating `golint` and it would be more helpful and convenient to reduce the warning noise by avoiding the use of underscore in this particular case.\r\n\r\nPlease note that `golint` does in fact accept the first/prefix underscore that you already have in there to minimize collisions. (not sure if this is a feature or a bug in `golint`). So there is really not much need for the second underscore that causes the `golint` warning. \r\n\r\nMoreover, I'm sure there are other unlikely names that could be used to further minimize collisions, for example `...StringerName` and `...StringerIndex`.",
