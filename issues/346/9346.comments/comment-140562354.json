I received a good answer [on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32592458/why-cant-go-parse-the-time-represented-by-the-provided-formats) just today that was more helpful for me than the docs, probably because it used complete real examples and was specific to the particular layout string I was using:\r\n\r\n\u003e The time.RFC3339 format is a case where the format string itself isn't a valid time. You can't have a Z and an offset in the time string, but the format string has both because the spec can contain either type of timezone specification.\r\n\r\n\u003e Both of these are valid RFC3339 times:\r\n\r\n\u003e `\"2015-09-15T14:00:12-00:00\"`\r\n\u003e `\"2015-09-15T14:00:13Z\"`\r\n\r\n\u003e And the time package needs to be able to parse them both using the same RFC3339 format string.",
