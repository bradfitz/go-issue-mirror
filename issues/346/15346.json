	"body": "on `go version go1.6 linux/amd64` (and previous as far as I know) the generated code by stringer has some:\r\n* const/vars with '_' in their name \r\n* uses `i -= 1`  instead of `i--`\r\n\r\nboth of which are things golint will (rightfully) complain about.\r\n\r\nCurrently this means that I would not use stringer (luckily my usecases are small enough to not be much of code), because I would have to hack my way around the automatic golinting of all (non vendor) code in our project.
