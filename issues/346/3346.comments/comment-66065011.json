It sounds like the Go program is producing UTF-8,\nbut the thing trying to print it is not configured for UTF-8. That doesn't sound like a\nGo bug to me; it sounds like either a bug in the program (e.g. if it needs to work in an\nenvironment that can't render UTF-8 then it shouldn't output UTF-8), or a configuration\nissue for the Windows terminal.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
