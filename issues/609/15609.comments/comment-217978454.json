I don't know how to write this instruction with the old assembler, so I don't know whether it was broken then.\r\n\r\nThere is a reasonably easy workaround:\r\n    MOVL\tÂ·pointer(SB),AX\r\n    CALL\tAX\r\n\r\nI think 1.8 is the right target.  We could consider a clearly correct fix for 1.7 but I don't see the CL that was sent out as clearly correct.",
