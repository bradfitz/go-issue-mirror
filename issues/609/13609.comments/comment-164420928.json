And I am not really sure how to reproduce it. We have 5 active high-load web services running on go 1.4.2 without issues. Since we started using 1.5.1 we are experiencing regular crashes related to cgo.\n\u003e \n\u003e I will try with 1.5.2 and update the issue if there are anymore issues.\n\u003e \n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n\u003e \n",
