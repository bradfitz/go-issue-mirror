Per \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/\u003c/a\u003e, pointers are flattened, so encoding\nstruct{x *int}{\u00260} (using \"\u00260\" as a notation for pointer to an int with value zero) is\nintended to be equivalent to encoding struct{x int}{0}, which is specified to not be\nexplicitly encoded.\n\nIt's a shame that this means that encoding/gob can't preserve things like protocol\nbuffers, but that's just the way it is. The workaround there is to encode the proto\nyourself, and encode []byte via gobs instead.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **packagechange**, removed **priority-triage**, **go1.1**._\n\n_Owner changed to @robpike._\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
