There are multiple representations for both positive\nand negative infinity, and for NaNs.  Go does permit denormalized numbers but I don't\nthink that affects this issue.\n\nI don't think it is possible to justify having two key values that are == not return the\nsame value in a map.  Go doesn't have any notion of \"different bit pattern but ==\", and\nI can't see any good reason to introduce one.\u003c/pre\u003e",
