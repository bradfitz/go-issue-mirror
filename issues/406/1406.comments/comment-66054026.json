Go will clone() as it feels it should, and with this\npatch, the system presumably could run out of pids.  A reasonably successful fork() bomb\non the machine could well panic a Go init process if the process table is full.  This\npanic could be averted with use of a non-existant GOMINPROCS that forced the scheduler\nto reserve an appropriate number of pids, though I imagine a better solution exists.\n\nSurprisingly in retrospect, I've not yet built an exec() type functionality into my init\nprogram, but I am curious to see what the launched+patched inits 'ps ax' looks like.\u003c/pre\u003e",
