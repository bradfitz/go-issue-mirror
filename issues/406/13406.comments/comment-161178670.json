What would people expect in a Windows environment?\r\n\r\nI am certainly not a git expert. I suppose if you need an editor available on any Windows computer, you cannot go past \"notpead\". It is very basic and noone uses it, but you can open a text file with it to allow editing. I don't expect it to return any useful exit code. And it is GUI program (not command line).\r\n\r\nMaybe it is possible to invoke git shell via git command somehow?\r\n\r\n\u003e Should we just disable this test on Windows?\r\n\r\nI have no problem with that. But it also means that \"git submit -i\" is broken too. Isn't it? Mind you, I don't use that facility myself.\r\n\r\nAlex",
