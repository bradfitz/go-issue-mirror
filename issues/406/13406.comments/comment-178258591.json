It looks like it split the arguments on the space after echo. How do you quote things in command prompt so they get passed as one argument and not expanded? Does `git -c alias.x=\"!echo $PATH\" x` work? I just want to see that PATH that git aliases are run with. Alternatively, you could add `x = !echo $PATH` to the `[alias]` section of .gitconfig and just run `git x`, which would avoid any shell quoting/splitting issues.",
