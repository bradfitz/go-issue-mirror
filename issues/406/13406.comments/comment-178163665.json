	"body": "Ah hah, so git is adding stuff to PATH when it runs an alias. That's missing in the test, so it fails. The only thing I see if obviously adding is the compiled-in `GIT_EXEC_PATH`. Mind running a few more things?\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit --exec-path\r\ngit -c alias.x='!echo $PATH' x\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second one works on Unix and I think git will run the alias with its built in POSIX shell, so it should be the same on Windows. If it doesn't work, you may need to tweak it by changing `$PATH` to `%PATH%` or something.\r\n\r\nAlso, is there a sh.exe in the exec path printed by the fist one?",
