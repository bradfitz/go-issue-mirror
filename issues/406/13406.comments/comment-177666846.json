But the test is still broken.\r\n\r\n\u003e That may be the best we can do.\r\n\r\nYes, I don't see way to improve TestSubmitInteractive. But I am also concerned that, perhaps, \"git submit -i\" doesn't work on windows too. If someone tell me how I can test \"git submit -i\" manually, I will try it on my windows computer. Alternatively we can just document that \"git submit -i\" is not supported on windows. Or we can also do nothing too.\r\n\r\nAlex",
