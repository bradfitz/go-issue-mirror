CL 20700 PS 1\r\n5. CL 20700 PS 1 with MPOL_BIND set to all numa nodes\r\n\r\nRunning on a two-socket host, when the application has GOMAXPROCS=16, GODEBUG=gctrace=1, ~60k goroutines, and ~200MB live heap, the sweep termination and mark termination pauses are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. 3.5ms and 42ms\r\n2. 0.70ms and 19ms # this data was collected several hours later than the others, so may not be directly comparable\r\n3. 0.17ms and 11ms\r\n4. 0.21ms and 1.3ms\r\n5. 0.085ms and 1.0ms\r\n\r\nDisabling memory migration via MPOL_BIND (configuration 5 vs 4) still has a measurable effect on the STW times, but both configurations are well within the 10ms budget now. Thank you!",
