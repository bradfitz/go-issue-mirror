	"body": "The migration can be disabled by binding the memory to particular nodesâ€”even the set of all nodes. Within `mpol_misplaced`, if the page's policy is set to `MPOL_BIND` and the page is already on an allowed node, the kernel will leave it where it is. This is why `numactl --membind 0,1` has the effect it does (the c4.8xlarge machine has just two nodes), even though it would logically seem to do nothing.\r\n\r\nhttp://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/mm/mempolicy.c?v=3.13#L2353\r\n\r\n@aclements, is the GC able to bind all memory to the full set of NUMA nodes for the duration of the STW phases via `set_mempolicy` with `MPOL_BIND`? \r\n",
