I'm a little confused by why this doesn't make concurrent mark also insanely expensive, since it's all random access. I see your sweep termination times are also very high. That also surprises me. We hardly do anything do sweep termination. We certainly aren't hitting all of the stacks or anything like that.\r\n\r\nOf course, the \"right\" solution to this is to be more NUMA friendly. That would improve things on NUMA systems whether or not they're doing still migration tricks. That may be necessary in the long term, but for now it would be great if we could just disable the migration.\r\n\r\n@rhysh, you may be more familiar with this feature. Do you happen to know if there's a way to just turn it off? I didn't see anything obvious in mbind or set_mempolicy. If you don't know, I'll dig around.",
