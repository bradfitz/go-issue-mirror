When the `innerxml` of the `\u003cSOAP-ENV:Body\u003e` is parsed, the xmlns:vbox=\"http://www.virtualbox.org\" mapping is unavailable to the newly created `xml.Decoder` inside the second call to `xml.Unmarshal`.\r\n\r\nHaving access to the namespaces from the outer `xml.Decoder` and being able to pass them to a new `xml.Decoder` would be one way to deal with this issue. :+1: ",
