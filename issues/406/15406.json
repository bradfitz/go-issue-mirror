	"title": "proposal: file system notifications library",
	"body": "Propose new package(s) under golang.org/x/ that provide wrappers around x/sys (syscall) or cgo implementations for the following file notification systems:\r\n\r\n* inotify and/or fanotify on Linux/Android\r\n* FSEvents on OS X\r\n* ReadDirectoryChangesW and/or USN Journals on Windows\r\n* kqueue on *BSD, OS X, and iOS\r\n* FEN on Solaris\r\n* (optionally) an efficient polling library intended for watching file shares and for Plan 9 \r\n\r\nCompared to syscall:\r\n\r\n* **Provide a slightly higher level API.**\r\n  For example, using EpollCreate1 with the file descriptor returned by InotifyInit.\r\n* **Specifically for file system notifications.**\r\n  For example, only supporting EVFILT_VNODE for kqueue.\r\n* **Rigorous test suite.** \r\n  Checks for compatibility across architectures (Go builders).\r\n* **Go-friendly APIs.**\r\n`Write` or `NoteWrite` rather than `NOTE_WRITE`.\r\n\r\nCompared to fsnotify:\r\n\r\n* **No attempt to provide common behaviour across notification systems.**\r\n* **Expose the full underlying API.** For example `InCloseWrite` and `InMoveTo` for inotify.\r\n* **Not a common API.** Each notification system would have a slightly different API.\r\n* **High quality reviewed code.** The Windows code in fsnotify is particularly difficult to follow.\r\n\r\nThe intent is that libraries such as fsnotify and @rjeczalik's [notify](https://github.com/rjeczalik/notify) could then depend on fsn instead of depending on syscall directly. Such libraries could offer common APIs and behaviour, including user-space recursive watching, filtering, etc. Various APIs could be explored in this space, while relying on the same solid underpinnings.\r\n\r\nrelated: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/4068\r\n",
