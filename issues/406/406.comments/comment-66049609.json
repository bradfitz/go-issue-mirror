The checkout on windows\ndiscards many of the important permission bits, and then\nthe build doesn't run cleanly.\n\nMercurial should install fine on any Linux box; there is a\nDebian package, or you can use easy_install.\nI think if you install check the tree out using Mercurial\non Linux, you will find that it works much better.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
