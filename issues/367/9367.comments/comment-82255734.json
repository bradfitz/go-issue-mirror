It's generally good (for performance) to avoid branching, except that branching code is often more clear.  In any case, I suspect it's moot because *I* can't think of an implementation of int() that wouldn't involve a branch somewhere under the hood.  int() just hides the branch, and it is less clear... although the brevity is admirable.",
