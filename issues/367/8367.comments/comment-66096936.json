The missing If-Range date handling is\nin ServeContent.\n\nAdding ETag in the way proposed could actively hurt: imagine a load-balanced environment\nwith Go servers on many backends with different filesystems. The inode number could\ndiffer and cause problems if mixed in to the ETag. Again, please open a separate bug for\nthat if you feel strongly and it can be discussed or designed separately. This bug\nshould be about the date handling only.\u003c/pre\u003e",
