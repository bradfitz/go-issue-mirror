	"body": "I don't necessarily want more SIGPIPE in #11845, although that was my initial suggestion.  What I really want is to get away from the magic number 10.  I think we should either ignore SIGPIPE or raise SIGPIPE immediately.  Since different programs have different needs, I think we may need to have a function that sets the desired behaviour.  For an HTTP server, indeed for any program that calls net.Listen, I think the correct default to ignore SIGPIPE.  For a command line program that is not a server, I think the correct default is to die on SIGPIPE.",
