	"body": "It's correct for the signal loop to report getting SIGPIPE, because the process _is_ getting SIGPIPEs (writing to closed connections). That's a fact of Unix, with nothing we can do about that.\n\nIf the process can be made to exit, it means that something wrote 10 times in a row to a specific closed network connection, ignoring the error. That causes the runtime to turn off its SIGPIPE handler and raise SIGPIPE itself. If an HTTP server can be forced to do that, either the SIGPIPE heuristic is buggy or the HTTP code is.\n\nFWIW, #11845 wants more SIGPIPE; this issue wants less SIGPIPE.",
