	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe arm tool chain uses MOVH for mem-\u0026gt;reg 16-\u0026gt;32 sign extended copy.\nIt assumes the same behavior for MOVH reg-\u0026gt;reg, which means that MOVH\nthat would otherwise not need a shift get unnecessary shifting.\n\nI think we should have MOVB, MOVH for just move, and then MOVBS/MOVBU\nand MOVHS/MOVHU for sign or zero extending move.\n\nIt's an involved change but would improve the efficiency of 8- and 16-bit math.\u003c/pre\u003e",
