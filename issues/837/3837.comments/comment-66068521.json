The syntax for adding a \nport to an IPv6 address is [addr]:port, but the [] are not part of the \naddr. \n\nIn addition to being consistent with the RFCs, this appears to be \nconsistent with other Unix programs. For example, on my Mac: \n\n$ telnet '[::1]' \n[::1]: nodename nor servname provided, or not known \n$ telnet ::1 \nTrying ::1... \ntelnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused \ntelnet: Unable to connect to remote host \n$ \n--\n\nMakes sense.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
