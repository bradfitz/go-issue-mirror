But taking a step back, isn't source address selection supposed to be the kernel's job?\r\n- If you specify an IPv4 source but connect to an IPv6 destination (or vice versa), the failure requires a timeout to elapse.  Instead, `Dial` should either filter out incompatible destinations, or ignore `LocalAddr` when using an incompatible destination.",
