	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.6 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOOS=\"darwin\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nrun any benchmark with the `-count` option set to more then 1 (for instance 3) and for at least 2 benchmark (eg. `A` and `B`)\r\n\r\nall `n` instance of `A` will be run before any instance of `B` is ran (`AAABBB` instead of `ABABAB`)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is that if I run my benchmarks several thousand time and the CPU is slightly less or more busy during the begining or the end it may bias the benchmark, while if they we're alternating at least it would affect the results equally\r\n\r\nI have a feeling this will get rejected but I wanted a second opinion\r\n\r\n",
