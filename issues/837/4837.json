Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\npath.Dir(\u0026quot;abc/def/\u0026quot;)\nfilepath.Dir(\u0026quot;abc/def/\u0026quot;)\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nabc\nabc\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nabc/def\nabc/def\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nplayground\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThe docs for both functions claim that trailing slashes are removed before processing. \nHowever, the Split() is actually done before Clean()ing.\n\nWhile we're at it, it seems that Split() ought to Clean() its input.  When am I ever\ninterested in the file named \u0026quot;\u0026quot;?\n\nI guess this would have been fixed by now if the authors actually thought it was broken.\n If not the code, then the docs should be fixed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
