Given\nthe following:\n\nurl.Parse(...)\n\nIf you were new to go, is url a variable or a package, just by looking at that line?\nBeing able to shadow package names with variables are even worse as it blurs lines\nbetween two concepts.\n\nAs I said, I realize this is a breaking language change, but I feel that developers\nshould be given the choice to prefix their package names with something reserved just\nfor package names.That way if I import net/url like this:\n\nimport #url \"net/url\"\n\nAnd then later do this:\n\n#url.Parse(...)\n\nI know that \"#url\" is a package and not a variable because \"#\" cannot be used in a\nvariable name.\u003c/pre\u003e",
