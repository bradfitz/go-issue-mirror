After\ndropping the final element using Split, the path is Cleaned and trailing slashes are\nremoved. If the path is empty, Dir returns \".\". If the path consists entirely of slashes\nfollowed by non-slash bytes, Dir returns a single slash. In any other case, the returned\npath does not end in a slash.\"\n\nThis seems pretty clear that the Split happens first, then the Clean, which is what's\nhappening. \n\nAs for why Split can return an empty string:\n\n\"Split splits path immediately following the final slash. separating it into a directory\nand file name component. If there is no slash path, Split returns an empty dir and file\nset to path. The returned values have the property that path = dir+file.\"\n\nThe empty string result in this case preserves the path = dir+file property, which is\nthe whole reason Split exists.\n\nIf we had it to do over again, we might change Dir and Base to Clean the path first (and\nI wouldn't change Split at all). Unfortunately, we don't have it to do over again: the\nGo 1 semantics are not something we can change.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
