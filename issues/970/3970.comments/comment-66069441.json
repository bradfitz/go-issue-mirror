Can we leave this issue\nin some postponed state?\nIt must be somehow solved for ThreadSanitizer - one way or another it must\nnot produce reports here for user tests. To date I have no special means to\n\"suppress\" some reports, that would be good to preserve.\nOne possible future solution would be - if/when runtime Processors are\ncommited and we have support for per-Processor caching (there are exactly\nGOMAXPROCS Processors), the blackhole woule be a good candidate for such\ncaching.\u003c/pre\u003e",
