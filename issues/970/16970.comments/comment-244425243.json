That's your choice.\r\n\r\nIf you change your environment or upgraded compiler to put CoreFoundation.h in your C include path, it should work.\r\n\r\nSupporting every possible compiler configuration is not a goal for the project. Most users install binaries. Users who are compiling Go from source usually use the default C compiler. You're off in on-your-own land. At this point we assume you know what you're doing. For a user who's chosen their own compiler, it would be equally surprising for us to override it.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could emit a warning on failure, though, noting that the compiler used is not what is typically seen.\r\n",
