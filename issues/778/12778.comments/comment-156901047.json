I believe in the current Go implementation the returning of [this error](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/25a28da0807f3fa85588fb219f6fa40314bde675/src/net/dnsclient.go#L88) when a response contains no useful answers does the same thing. I haven't found anywhere else in glibc where the RA bit factors in when deciding whether to accept an answer or not.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the one linked for this issue there is also [this check](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/735c65fa9c8569a8d40411056f6cfa7dbe28a689/src/net/dnsclient_unix.go#L185) that considers the RA bit. I think at least that part of the greater condition could be removed, if not reducing it to just `if err == nil` as it seems to duplicate checks that `answer` does already.\r\n\r\nWill open a CL for this.",
