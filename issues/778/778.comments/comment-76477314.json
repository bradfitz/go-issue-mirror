Not sure why I even thought it would in the first place (how embarrassing).  What I conflated, in my head, was my example and:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc TestFunc(m interface{}) {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike I said new to Go (and Github Issues format)...\r\n\r\nI can delete my post if that's acceptable.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
