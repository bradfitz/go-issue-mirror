You are passing a map of a different type (map[string]int) as as argument to a parameter of type map[interface{}]interface{}.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to other languages, in Go types have to match much more closely, there's no contravariance in play when passing arguments, and there's no implicit dynamic checking either.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't and shouldn't compile and is unrelated to the issue at hand that was fixed a while back. (The issue is about concrete key values used in a map with interface{} key type. Your example is about assigning a map of one type to a map of another.)",
