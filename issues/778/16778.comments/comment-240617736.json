You have always been able (and continue to be able) to have Go pointers point to differently allocated memory (globals, cgo-allocated stuff, syscall.Mmap, etc.).  What's currently newly breaking in go 1.7 is pointer arithmetic on pointers that point to no memory, i.e. faulting pages.\r\nI'm thinking about maybe fixing this in some way.
