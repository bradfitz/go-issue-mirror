	"body": "From:\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/ced0646fe5ed9abb3b51fa99748b090f1dfe90e8/src/net/dnsclient.go#L43\r\n\r\nit looks like any NXDOMAIN reply where the server doesn't allow recursive queries is treated as \"server misbehaving\". I would expect this to be treated like any other case where the name doesn't exist and get a \"no such host\" error instead.\r\n\r\nAny reason why we have the \"\u0026\u0026 dns.recursion_available\" part of the condition?",
