I changed my rules from:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo install -x\r\nGOARCH=386 go install -x\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo install -x\r\nGOARCH=386 go build -x -o $(GOBIN)/linux_386/binary\r\n```\r\n\r\nand it's now working as before.\r\n\r\nThough, to be honest, I liked the previous way better, less typing, more streamlined rules for building. 386 binaries are executable on the amd64 platform, so makes sense to have them in the subdirectory of $GOPATH/bin.\r\n\r\nIf this change in policy is final, certainly the error message should be improved to tell that `go install` won't work for cross-compiling and that `go build -o` should be used.",
