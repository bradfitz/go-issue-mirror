Supporting an \"array\" tag, even on struct fields only, is much faster for this type of problem, and will probably help a lot of people that currently unmarshal json into an interface slice and then type check each item in the slice by hand, since stuffing your actual pointers into an interface slice is not what people think of first when they bump into this sort of problem.",
