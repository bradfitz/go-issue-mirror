What happens is that the inlining information is missing the\nparentheses that make the if statement grammatically correct.\n\nSee the spec:\nA parsing ambiguity arises when a composite literal using the TypeName form of the\nLiteralType appears between the keyword and the opening brace of the block of an \"if\",\n\"for\", or \"switch\" statement, because the braces surrounding the expressions in the\nliteral are confused with those introducing the block of statements. To resolve the\nambiguity in this rare case, the composite literal must appear within parentheses.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **compilerbug**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
