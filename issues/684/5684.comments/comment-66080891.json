Evaluate how other proxies (mod_proxy, nginx proxy_pass, haproxy) handle the\nsub-delims in each of path, userinfo and password.\n2. Evaluate how url.RequestURI is being used in the stdlib, identifying any places that\nmight be impacted negatively by this change and a plan to test / evaluate the impact.\n\nI will also review the history of the CL as per rsc in #2\u003c/pre\u003e",
