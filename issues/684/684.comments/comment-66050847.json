To avoid \ndoing a dns lookup inside Dial() every time, I would call net.LookupHost() and pass the \nreturned IP to Dial.  The program failed when I would call net.LookupHost with an IP, \nwhich was unexpected (I was used to the gethostbyname behavior).  Not a big deal, but \nperhaps the behavior should be documented.\u003c/pre\u003e",
