Curiously in testing this I saw hangs at 60,600 and 13,500 so I don't think\nthere is anything special about the number of connections.\n\nIn my testing, while ./6.out stopped processing connections, I could telnet to the\naccepting socket and it picked up my connection, read a byte, then closed the socket as\nexpected, but that did not unblock the test program.\n\nI ran this code on a darwin/6g system and got the familar\n\n2011/04/22 15:03:24 at 16200\n2011/04/22 15:03:24 at 16300\n2011/04/22 15:03:24 Accept: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:51630: address already in use\n\nHave you run this test code on and linux hosts ? I'm trying now on an 8g and a 6g system\nbut the results are inconclusive so far. If you can't reproduce the hang on a linux\nsystem then I would like to close this issue and open another one against the kqueue\npollsters in fd_darwin.go and fd_freebsd.go. What do you think ?\u003c/pre\u003e",
