	"body": "by **micha@bit.ly**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIf I make an HTTP request that utilizes the doFollowingRedirects method using a\nredirectChecker that always returns an error (ie: doesn't allow any redirects), the\nresulting http.Response is nil.\n\nI would expect that the response for this call could include a http.Response object with\nthe appropriate status code for the redirect and any headers that were sent.\n\nThis can be seen in the code at \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/CjWLK6hfX3\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/CjWLK6hfX3\u003c/a\u003e (it doesn't run on\nthe page, you have to run it locally).  If you are using go1.0.3 you will have a runtime\nerror (although things work fine with go1.0.2).\n\nA simple fix to this would be not to send a nil response at the end of the\ndoFollowingRedirects when an error occurs (ie: simply set err to the appropriate error\nin \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/src/pkg/net/http/client.go?s=6551:6611#L276\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/src/pkg/net/http/client.go?s=6551:6611#L276\u003c/a\u003e and then return).  The\nbody can still be closed (as I would expect since an error occurred), however I also\nexpect to be able to inspect the metadata of the transaction.\u003c/pre\u003e",
