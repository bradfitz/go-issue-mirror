That is truly thinking out of the box that makes Go great!\r\n\r\nI came across this (white/grey/black hat?) article: http://spth.virii.lu/eof2/articles/WarGame/vboxdetect.html, but then realize it may be dependent on the guest OS and a bit too complicated.\r\n\r\nHowever, since we know that we want to disable sendfile() *if and only if* sendfile() fails to do its work, perhaps we can use sendfile() itself to test for this errant behaviour?\r\n\r\nI have just done a quick test, i.e. after running `hugo --watch server` and edited `content/about.md`, changes are instantly visible if I do `cat public/about/index.html` from the shell, but running `curl http://localhost:1313/about/` gets the same old content unchanged, even if I were to restart the Hugo server!  The only way to remedy this is to `rm -rf public/` and restart `hugo --watch server`.\r\n\r\nSo yes, I think it will work!  :-)",
