This accommodates\nWindows safely without having to define a syscall.Handle type on Unix.\n\nDelete O_NDELAY, O_NONBLOCK, O_NOCTTY, O_ASYNC.\nPeople can import syscall for those very system-specific ones.\nMaybe delete some error constants (ENXIO,...).\n\nDoc for Environ: s/array/copy/ (it's a slice, but get across that it's not the real\nthing either).\n\nDelete Exec, which is a trivial wrapper around syscall.Exec, cannot be implemented on\nWindows, and does not work on OS X?  (On OS X, only single-threaded programs can use\nexec.)\n\nDoc for ShellExpand: s/operating system's/current/ (as in current process, current\nprogram).\nRename ShellExpand -\u0026gt; ExpandEnv.  Shell implies other expansions that are not being\ndone\n(like globbing).\n\nDoc for Stat: delete talk about FollowedSymlink.\u003c/pre\u003e",
