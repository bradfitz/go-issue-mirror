	"body": "\u003cpre\u003e1.\nImagine yourself coming to play.golang.org for the first time.\n\n2.\nTrying to experiment with something from package time, you edit the imports to include\n\u0026quot;time\u0026quot;: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/CZpUiGyVho\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/CZpUiGyVho\u003c/a\u003e\n\n3.\nNoticing the \u0026quot;Format\u0026quot; button, you press it.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/-oPFe90KmG\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/-oPFe90KmG\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/duRF5gXJEP\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/duRF5gXJEP\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThe intent of goimports is good and everything - but only in the hands of a well\ninformed hacker who welcomes what goimports do (I don't). For a newbie coming to\nplayground, it's inexplicable why the \u0026quot;Format\u0026quot; button \u0026quot;eats\u0026quot; her\nedits so far.\n\n- There's no information and/or warning about this behavior available to the\nplayground's user.\n\n- Moreover, \u0026quot;Format\u0026quot; is probably rightfully expected to change only the white\nspace of a program, not its semantics.\n\nI have missed the change on the dev-list and was thus genuinely surprised the same as\nany dev-list non reader could/would possibly be.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n- Remove the goimports functionality.\n- Or make it a standalone button.\n- Or disable/enable goimports by a check box.\n- Avoid the confusion by providing a prominently visible information that\n\u0026quot;Format\u0026quot; will remove your unused imports (and insert missing used ones, but\nthat's a welcome \u0026quot;surprise\u0026quot;).\n\n----\nI personally avoid any automatic source changing \u0026quot;on save\u0026quot; for good (for me)\nreasons. It's just my personal preference and no one is pushing such thing on me, so no\nproblem; neither for me nor anyone else. However, at the playground we are now forcing\nsuch thing on the playground users in a potentially quite confusing way, which I believe\nis a good intended mistake.\u003c/pre\u003e",
