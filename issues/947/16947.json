	"body": "The `URL.ResolveReference` method uses the unescaped version of the path (rather than `RawPath`), and so loses the URL's desired escaping and makes incorrect decisions if the path contains escaped slashes (%2f).\r\n\r\nAs a simple example:\r\n```\r\nbase := http://example.com/foo%2fbar/\r\nref := ../up \r\nurl := base.ResolveReference(ref) // == http://example.com/foo/up\r\n```\r\nThe correct answer should be `http://example.com/up`\r\n\r\nSee https://play.golang.org/p/Xptwz1obCZ for an example comparing the behaviour of %2f and %20 (an interesting case is also with %2d â€“ the final URL is correct, but you lose the desired escaping of the hyphen).\r\n\r\nI think the fix is to make `ResolveReference` operate on the `EscapedPath` values, and unescape at the end.\r\n\r\n/cc @bradfitz\r\n\r\n\r\n",
