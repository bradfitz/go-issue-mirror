We can't help with problems\nthat require being a Postgres admin and that involve \napparently undocumented functions (lo_unlink).\n\nI spent a half hour on this trying to install prerequisites\nand set up the environment properly and it's just too much.\nSorry.\n\nIf you can produce a smaller example that doesn't involve\nPostgres, please file another issue.\n\nOne possible way for you to debug this problem is to change\nyour calls like C.lo_unlink to be C.my_lo_unlink and\ndefine (in the import \"C\" comment) your own wrappers\nthat print the arguments to the function before calling\nthe C version.  Then you can make sure that the sequence\nof calls is exactly the same in the Go version and the C\nversion, by looking at the prints.  If it's not, then you'll\nhave a demonstration that doesn't involve Postgres.\nAnd if it is, then it's not cgo's fault.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Invalid**._",
