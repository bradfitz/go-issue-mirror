	"body": "@mdempsky Some of the wording here is historic - it's not clear that a field x.f is a \"variable\" hence some of the repetition. Furthermore, while I like your general rephrasing, it's less precise: unsafe.Alignof doesn't work on types, only expressions (including constants):\r\n```\r\npackage main\r\nimport \"unsafe\"\r\nconst c = 2.718\r\nfunc f() int { return 0 }\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tprintln(unsafe.Alignof(3+4))\r\n\tprintln(unsafe.Alignof(c))\r\n\tprintln(unsafe.Alignof(f))\r\n\t// println(unsafe.Alignof(int)) // doesn't work for types\r\n}\r\n```\r\nShould be clarified but is not urgent.",
