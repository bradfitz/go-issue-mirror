Normally calling\nlo_close() on unlinked large object is safe, but if I do it in Go that will corrupt my\ndatabase.\n\nI am attaching my C and Go test programs, both are same (difference being only\nlanguage). See my comments in Go program.\n\nCreate new database. Then run the Go program connecting to new database. If you run it\nfirst time you shall see that you were able to open unlinked large object. If you run it\nnext time (and all next successive calls) lo_create() will always fail.  Also see my\ncomments in Go program.\n\nThe same C program is ok.\n\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux 386\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?
