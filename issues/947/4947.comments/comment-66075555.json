Are\n\u003eyou sure that's all of them?\n\nWe may also need FETCH_OR for GC to manipulate bitmasks, or maybe not.\n\nI would expect ORDER to be represented as enum and type as Type (for codegen only size\nis relevant so int32/uint32/int64/uint64/inptptr/uintptr is only 2 cases), so it's only\n4 intrinsics -- LOAD, STORE, COMPARE_EXCHANGE and FETCH_OP.\u003c/pre\u003e",
