	"body": "I'm not sure I would single out that particular change.  After that change, the builder consistently timed out and looked flaky.  The first time I see an error other than a timeout or a SIGTRAP signal was in http://build.golang.org/log/d8be87e27545cca84e8d0721c7b663ddb15ac7e4 for the change  https://github.com/golang/go/commit/d75acd67eccbfe6f03b6474baea3b569cd0135d6 (which was clearly not the cause).  So I think the error could have been introduced anywhere between those two changes, which is unfortunately a fair amount of ground.",
