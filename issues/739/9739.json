	"body": "syscall.PtraceGetRegs uses syscall.PtraceRegs. syscall.PtraceRegs depends on the host, e.g. if your binary is linux/386 syscall.PtraceRegs has 16 registers. But it's possible to run that linux/386 on an amd64 kernel, and attach to an amd64 process. In that case, syscall.PtraceRegs is not good anymore because the amd64 variant has 26 registers.\r\n\r\nI have found this while trying to debug an arm64 Go process using an arm Go debugger.\r\n",
