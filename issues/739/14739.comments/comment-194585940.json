We could make it work if required, but I don't think GPG signing adds much anyway. We already have an API now to let you fetch (over HTTPS, with Google certs) the SHA-256 of the downloads, and then you can verify your curl with sha256sum or whatever. But even that is a little redundant, since we offer the downloads over https too.\r\n\r\nPut another way: what's the threat you're concerned about?\r\n",
