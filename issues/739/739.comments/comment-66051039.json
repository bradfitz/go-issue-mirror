The compiler behaves by the spec, but my point is that\nthe spec seems too convoluted:\n\n(1) According to the spec the following two functions are different, but\naccording to common-sense programmer's assumption, they shouldn't be:\n\nfunc f() (n int) {\n n,err := Read(...)\n return\n}\n\nand\n\nfunc f() (n int) {\n {\n   n,err := Read(...)\n   return\n }\n}\n\n(2) I have made the following error over and over again in my code\nover the past few months, *despite* having known of this issue at various\ntimes (and forgotten it):\n\nfunc f() (err os.Error) {\n if _,err := Read(); err != nil {\n   return\n }\n}\n\nAnd consequently, in complex programs, this takes forever to debug,\nespecially because while you are debugging it you still have the wrong\nidea in your mind about what this code does, so you eyeball it and\nyou think, the error is not there.\n\n--P\u003c/pre\u003e",
