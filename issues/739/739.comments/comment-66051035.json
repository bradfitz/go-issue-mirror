Because \"the new\" n shadows the return parameter n.\nOn the other hand, the following is allowed:\nf() (n int) {\n  {\n    n := 4\n    ...\n    return  // MARK\n  }\n  panic(\"x\")\n}\nSo, it seems that as soon as we are in a sub-block of the function body, the compiler\nceases to check whether locally defined new variables shadow the return parameters.\nThis creates a very easy spot for programmer confusion at the MARK, because the \nprogrammer is thinking that the local copy of \"n\" is what is returned, when in fact\nit is not.\u003c/pre\u003e",
