I'm using this code to marshal and unmarshal XMPP traffic,\nwhich uses namespaces quite a bit.\n\nIt's not important to me whether my patch is the one that fixes this bug; I'd just like\nto see it fixed. But if nobody else is going to fix it, I'd appreciate an explanation of\nwhat requirements my patch needs to meet in order to be accepted.\u003c/pre\u003e",
