Would it be possible to see the offending code so that compiler folks can look into compiler work, if necessary (perhaps after you tried the suggestions)? If this impacts performance by 12% I'd assume it to be part of extremely \"hot\" code, so perhaps even a small code snippet should show the problem?\r\n\r\nFinally a request for clarification: I'm not sure I understand the difference between `push(stack, a, b, c)` and `append(stack, a, b, c)`. Is there one?",
