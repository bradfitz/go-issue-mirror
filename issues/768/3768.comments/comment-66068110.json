C/C++ code can only call back to Go by calling a function\nmarked as //export in the cgo input file, and function must be called by name, not via a\nfunc value passed from Go.  If you want to call an arbitrary func value from C/C++, you\nneed to pass the value to an exported Go function that calls it for you.\n\nThere is an example of a callback (though not one using a func value) in misc/cgo/life\nin the Go sources.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
