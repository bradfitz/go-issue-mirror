It's easy enough to use as is, and things like IDEs can and do take care of this, or the user can write a shell script if the \u0026\u0026 burns the fingers.\r\n\r\nAnd, as you observe, trying to flow things like this automatically raises lots of issues of error handling and recovery and expands the space of interacting flags. The go command is already FAR too complex, and go test one of the worst offenders, and go test -cover its worst piece.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to leave things as they are, but I will not veto a complete, implementable, clean proposal. At the moment this is just brainstorming.",
