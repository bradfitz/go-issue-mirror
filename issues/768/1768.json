	"body": "by **staura**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eFeature request: It would be practical to have filename easily available from\nmime.multipart.Part, since FormName() is already implemented. Although it would be\ncleaner to have neither FormName() or filename:\n\nIn my opinion I don't see why you need to have different implementations for multipart\nforms. Why do I need to read the whole request body in order to use FormValue()? As\nthings are now I need to parse the multipart.Part mime header to get the filename, if I\ndon't want to read in the whole file. What if I want to check the file extension first?\nYes, there are ways to get around this, but I don't see why ParseMultipartForm would be\nneeded; ParseForm should work on a multipart forms as well, and the reading of the files\ncontent should be separated.\n\nYou already have FormFile(), why not move reading the file into to that function and\nmake the parsing free of file operations?\u003c/pre\u003e",
