Currently it only exports\nImportPaths, more would be added by request.\n\nIn my opinion, however, this is only a workaround. Having go tool related functionality\neither in the standard library, or the go.tools repository (even though then the go tool\nitself couldn't use it) would encourage writing 3rd party tools that behave correctly,\ni.e. support the same functionality and input that the go tool supports. Right now,\neveryone is writing their own code -- some tools do not support the \"...\" pattern, for\nexample.\n\nAs an aside, however, the format of \"go list\" can be normed however you want, it accepts\na template as one of its arguments, that specifies exactly what it outputs. And its\ndefault output is also documented.\u003c/pre\u003e",
