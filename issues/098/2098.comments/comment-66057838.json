There is specific code (go/printer/nodes.go:803) that\n\"shrinks down\" the expressions of function calls with more than one argument to make the\narguments stick out better (between the commas). You can put parentheses around the\nentire expression, e.g.:\n\n\tr := make([]string, (5 * *s))\n\ts := make([]string, (-5 * -*s))\n\nThen you get the extra spaces again.\n\nObviously, this is a matter of taste, but there is not bug in the code as is.\u003c/pre\u003e",
