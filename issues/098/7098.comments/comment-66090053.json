There is a whole class of degenerate results when the sum of the\nweights is small. Naturally, the uniformity of the results improves measurable once the\nsum of the weights increases to ~100.\n\nProbably the best thing is to add a weight multiplier to minimize the error when the sum\nof weights is small.\u003c/pre\u003e",
