We will collect a minimum of 1 sample every ~10MB, and the loop in that function allocates 180MB.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that sampling is disabled on this platform, or that the sampling rate has been changed? Or could there be background goroutines allocating memory? How flaky is the testcase, does it fail frequently?",
