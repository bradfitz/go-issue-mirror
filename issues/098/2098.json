	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThis is pretty close to tip. The program at the bottom of this bug demonstrates the\nspacing problem.\n\nThe multiply expressions for p and r are the same, but are laid out very differently by\ngofmt. In r's case, it's a little misleading; it looks like an exponentiation operator.\n\nThe same expression, with a unary negation added to the product terms is more of the\nsame, and the confusion due to spacing is even more pronounced.\n\n----------\npackage main\n\nfunc main() {\n        s := make(int)\n        *s = 3\n\n        p := 5 * *s\n        q := -5 * -*s\n        r := make([]string, 5**s)\n        s := make([]string, -5*-*s)\n}\n----------\u003c/pre\u003e",
