It's more likely that the code is\nmessed up and failing to get a home directory than the user not having a home directory.\n\nIt doesn't respect $HOME because the Lookup and LookupId functions look up any user (not\njust the current one), so $HOME wouldn't be correct in the general sense.  Current() is\njust a convenience wrapper around LookupId.\n\nWhat is the home dir on Debian buildd accounts set to?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @bradfitz._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
