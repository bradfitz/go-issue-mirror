What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nlinux/amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/S_vq5DdCzu\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n`true`\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n`false`\r\n\r\nThe doc for `reflect.DeepEqual` says:\r\n\r\n\u003e Map values are deeply equal if they are the same map object or if they have the same length and their corresponding keys (matched using Go equality) map to deeply equal values.\r\n\r\nEmpty and nil maps both have a length of zero, so I would expect this to be true.",
