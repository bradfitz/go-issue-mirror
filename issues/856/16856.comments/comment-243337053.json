However Ian's\nview is reasonable too. Namely, if you only read what you\nwrite, and this will help detect cases where the stream is\nout of sync.\n\nAll the other supported types have the one-to-one property\nwrt. encoding/decoding, but bool doesn't have that property,\nwhich opens the door for such discussions as whether we\nshould allow 2 as true or not.\n",
