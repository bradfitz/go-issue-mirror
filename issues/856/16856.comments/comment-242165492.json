Note that this implementation considers zero `false` and non-zero `true` when decoding, just like the aforementioned standard libraries. I could not see any possible performance or LoC improvement to restricting the values to `0` and `1` (in fact, additional error checking would be required).\r\n\r\nSee the referenced commit (https://github.com/blixt/go/commit/39e39df093a57fc698a224c3b4eebb8dc6477851).",
