	"body": "Inconsistent use of ReadError has existed since the first commit of [inflate.go](https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/lib/compress/flate/inflate.go?spec=svn69284ac063ffebd34827268e328a33647090e34b\u0026r=69284ac063ffebd34827268e328a33647090e34b). You can see that the error returned by ReadByte is never wrapped.\r\n\r\nI vote that compress/flate stop wrapping IO errors with ReadError and just return the error ad-verbatim since this seems to be the behavior of most other libraries (not to mention that it was rare for the ReadError wrapping to occur in the first place). In the documentation, it should note that ReadError and WriteError are deprecated (#10909) and no longer used.\r\n\r\nI also vote that we remove use of InternalError and switch to panic if we can prove that the 3 uses of it really can't happen.",
