	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThis issue perplexes me to the point that I'm not able to reproduce it using a minimal\nexample.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/andlabs/ui/issues/29\"\u003ehttps://github.com/andlabs/ui/issues/29\u003c/a\u003e\nA bunch of people have reported in my GUI package (github.com/andlabs/ui) is spitting\nout numerous errors such as\n\ngithub.com/andlabs/ui(.text): undefined: github.com/andlabs/ui(/1124)\ngithub.com/andlabs/ui(.text): undefined: github.com/andlabs/ui(/1081)\ngithub.com/andlabs/ui(.text): undefined: github.com/andlabs/ui(/1031)\ngithub.com/andlabs/ui(.text): undefined: github.com/andlabs/ui(/982)\n\nduring the executable link process.\n\nWhat Wessie in #go-nuts and myself have gathered is:\n\n- this happens with any configuration of gcc 4.9.x from MinGW-w64\n- this happens on real Windows, not with the Linux cross-compilers\n- Windows version doesn't matter (I've confirmed this with the Windows 10 Technical\nPreview)\n\nAs mentioned, I tried writing several different possible minimal examples, but none of\nthem have exhibited this problem.\n\nThanks...\u003c/pre\u003e",
