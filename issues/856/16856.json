	"body": "The only fixed-size built-in type that's not supported currently is `bool`. Since it's arguably one of the more commonly used data types, I would propose its inclusion in `encoding/binary`.\r\n\r\nThe `bool` encoding would be equivalent to `uint8` where zero maps to `false` and non-zero (`1`, usually) maps to `true`.",
