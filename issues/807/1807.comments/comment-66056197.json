This issue tells you\nthat there is a recognized problem that affects Go users and what its status is.\n\nThe issue doesn't have to be an issue that the Go team can solve to be included in the\nGo issue tracker, just an issue that Go users should be aware of. For example, Ubuntu's\nproblem with the gold linker affects Go users.\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/1588\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/1588\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\nThe issue has now been fixed.
