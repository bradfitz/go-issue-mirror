Often the Overview documentation includes examples of how to use the package,\nbut these are not compiled and tested as example functions; they are just text.  I'd\nlike to be able to include package-level examples that are compiled and tested.\n\nOptions:\n- Just as we extract ExampleF() as an example for function F in the package, we could\nextract Example() as a package-level example (and Example_note() for a secondary\nexample).  The primary example could be opened by default, immediately following the\noverview.\n- Or we could adopt a model similar to the present tool: allow the Overview (and\npossibly other godoc comments) to embed code from other files in the package, extracted\nwith subcommands like the one present uses:\n  .code example_test.go /START/,/END/\u003c/pre\u003e",
