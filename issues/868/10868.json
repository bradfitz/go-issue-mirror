	"body": "I'm using Go 1.4.2 on Linux/amd64 and was unpleasantly surprised that the functions in the `os/user` package aren't implemented for GOARCH=386, e.g. a call to `user.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat usertest.go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n\t\"fmt\"\r\n\t\"os/user\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tu, err := user.Current()\r\n\tfmt.Printf(\"current user: %#v %#v\\n\", u, err)\r\n}\r\n\r\n$ GOARCH=amd64 go run usertest.go \r\ncurrent user: \u0026user.User{Uid:\"1000\", Gid:\"1000\", Username:\"fd0\", Name:\"Alexander Neumann\", HomeDir:\"/home/fd0\"} \u003cnil\u003e\r\n\r\n$ GOARCH=386 go run usertest.go \r\ncurrent user: (*user.User)(nil) \u0026errors.errorString{s:\"user: Current not implemented on linux/386\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect that the functions work as advertised, it sad that there are  functions in the stdlib that (at least for me as a user) just don't work on some architectures. Is this documented somewhere and I overlooked it?\r\n\r\nWhat's the reason for this?",
