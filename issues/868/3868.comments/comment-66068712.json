If you've created a go executable called 'go-logger', and execute it from a\nshell as:\n\n    $ go-logger a b c\n\nos.Args in this case will be [\"go-logger\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].  If you don't explicitly set\na prefix for syslog, then it will use 'go-logger', which seems quite reasonable to me.\u003c/pre\u003e",
