I didn't know that cgo can't handle static libs\nlacking -fPIC, etc.  (And it took me quite a while to figure it out,\nespecially with \"Go links statically\" branded into my brain.)\n\nMaybe this should be documented at \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cmd/cgo/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cmd/cgo/\u003c/a\u003e ?  Perhaps\nCGO could fail descriptively?  Actually, I think it does fail in an earlier\nversion, but only with \"undefined symbol\" or something.\n\nSo my trouble is past, but I guess you've still got trouble in that I was\nable to (successfully?) link against libglfw.a but failed to call into it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
