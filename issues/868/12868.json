	"body": "I'd like to add a method to `os/exec.Cmd` to ease setting environment variables on commands before they're run.\r\n\r\nManipulating `Env []string` lists is tedious and error-prone, especially considering potential duplicates. (since programs would others choose either the first or last occurrence, unpredictably)\r\n\r\nThe proposed `Cmd.SetEnv(key, value string)` method would be documented as removing duplicates.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, environment variables are case-insensitive, so the method on Windows should de-dup case insensitively.\r\n\r\nThis method would replace a handful of copies of `func mergeEnvLists` that exist in various forms around the standard library, tests, and x/* repos.\r\n\r\n/cc @ianlancetaylor @adg @rsc @griesemer @robpike ",
