It's already being executed within a function, and the function\nreturns on each of those iterations.\n\nWhat you are seeing in the log above may just be a side effect of garbage\ncollection timing.\n\nFor example, here is your original sample modified to be closer to this\nuse case:\n\n  \u003ca href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/570502/\"\u003ehttp://paste.ubuntu.com/570502/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nHere is an output log from it:\n\n  \u003ca href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/570503/\"\u003ehttp://paste.ubuntu.com/570503/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nNote how it increases but then goes back and forth.  This proves Andrew's\npoint, that the behavior described should not affect the application in normal\ncircumstances.\n\nA separate point above is about your use of maps.  You describe them as being\nslow, but then it sounds like you're finding that while ranging over them.\nMaps are optimized for random access, not linear, so it feels like the wrong\ndata structure for what you're doing.\n\nThis is getting off topic, though.  For discussions on usage of language\nfeatures and performance characteristics, please use the go-nuts mailing\nlist.\u003c/pre\u003e",
