	"body": "Hey @rakyll!\r\n\r\nYour modification shows how dangerous it may be to have to manually add a forward declaration. You added:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint callOnMeGo(int);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the real prototype of this function is (on my platform):\r\n\r\n```\r\ntypedef long long GoInt64;\r\ntypedef GoInt64 GoInt;\r\nextern GoInt callOnMeGo(GoInt p0);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`sizeof(int) == 4` and `sizeof(long long) == 8`. You can't use `GoInt` here and I suppose that the size of `GoInt` depends on the platform. The best we should be able to do is to include `_cgo_export.h` but it is not generated yet.",
