	"body": "by **jason.swank**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe base64 package does not decode base64 encoded content with newlines, as is typical\nw/ email attachments and most base64 implementations every 76 characters.\n\nThe Mime RFC (2045) section 6.8 specifies all non-alphanumeric characters must be\nignored by a compliant decoder, but warnings/errors might be appropriate under some\ncircumstances.\n\nAttached is a small go base64 program- base64.go.  Using it along w/ the system's base64\ncommand, it is easy to reproduce the issue:\n\n1) WORKS, no newlines: \n   $ echo -n \u0026quot;Hello, World\u0026quot; | base64 -w 0 | ./base64-go\n   Hello, World\n\n2) BROKEN, newlines every 12 characters:\n   $ echo -n \u0026quot;Hello, World\u0026quot; | base64 -w 12 | ./base64-go\n   Hello, Wo\n   illegal base64 data at input byte 12\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)? 8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using? Linux i686\n\nWhich revision are you using?  0beb796b4ef8+ weekly/weekly.2011-12-02\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2541/0/base64-go.go\"\u003ebase64-go.go\u003c/a\u003e (407 bytes)",
