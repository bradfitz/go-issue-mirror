The only thing left what I still think is a\nreal mistake is that \"very dark text\" on black background. Yes, it's not relevant to the\ncoverage but it's very relevant to visual navigation in the source. Yet its contrast is\nso low that it's a challenge to read it, probably even for young eyes. I'd guess that\nany typographer/graphic designer would judge the contrast unacceptably low in the same\nway there are lower limits on font sizes for anyone to read comfortably.\n\nAnd lastly, I was not aware my slight visual impairment is so rare. I thought that's the\nreason why there are AFAIK no books with white (or \"very dark\" for that matter) text on\nblack paper.\u003c/pre\u003e",
