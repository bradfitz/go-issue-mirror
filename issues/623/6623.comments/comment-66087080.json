The color scheme was designed with that in mind,\nobviously, and also to make \"heat maps\" work. With a white background, the colors\nindicating different levels of execution were too hard to decode.\n\nTo help with color blindness, the green has a lot of blue in it and the intensity alone\nis used to define the value, so that the color is not discriminatory.\n\n*Most people do not understand red-green color blindness. It's a contrast problem more\nthan an inability to see red and green.
