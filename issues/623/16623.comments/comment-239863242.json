The refactored cmd/cgo package would provide the logic for processing the `import \"C\"` preambles such that (e.g.) go/types could directly construct an appropriate go/types.Package.\r\n\r\nIt's true that there are other tools that generate Go source code, but those produce .go files that the user is responsible for managing themselves.  Cgo is distinguished from them because it's transparently handled by cmd/go, not to mention having explicit runtime and toolchain support.",
