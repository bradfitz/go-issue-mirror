That was the reason for your\nchange. Russ said (\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/1834?c=1)\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/1834?c=1)\u003c/a\u003e:\n\n\" ... It would be nice if we got the English text all the time on Windows, to match the\nbehavior on other systems. ...\"\n\nAlso, I undestand your reasoning - \"...to avoid outputting multibyte CJK characters to\nthe console...\".\n\nWe could just say:\n\nWindows retuned error #2\n\ninstead of more confusing\n\nerror 2 (FormatMessage failed with err=15100)\n\nLets wait for others before we decide.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
