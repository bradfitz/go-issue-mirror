This doesn't merit a language change.\nIf we need to support baked-in copies of binary data - and that's\nunclear to me - then it would be easy to define:\n\npackage resource\nfunc Load(name string) ([]byte, error)\nfunc Install(name string, data []byte)\n\nand then have the \"resource compiler\" arrange to call resource.Install\nduring a func init. No language change needed.\n\nHowever, I am not suggesting that we do this. It's a big topic and\nit's unclear that that's the right API. I'm merely pointing out that\nit doesn't require a language change.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
