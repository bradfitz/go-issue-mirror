This can be down with a custom\nhandler wrapping a Handler.\n\n2) It [the server] cannot be given a list of roots to give to the client.\n\nI'm not sure what this means.  I've never used this part of TLS.  Jeff, Adam?\n\n3) The client side does not choose certificates according to the incoming trust list.\n\nDoes this logic exist elsewhere in the crypto/tls package?  Is the\nhttp.Transport.TLSClientConfig just not being used somewhere it should be?\n\n4) The marchalling/unmarshalling of the certificateRequest message is wrong, meaning\nthat it only works in the case where the server elects to send no trust list.\n\nThis sounds like a bug.  More details / repro test case?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **HelpWanted**._",
