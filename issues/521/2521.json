	"body": "by **jeff.allen**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eTLS client authentication as implemented as of rev 10679\nis not good enough for production use.\n\nThe server side cannot be instructed to require certs. It cannot be given a list of\nroots to give to the client.\n\nThe client side does not choose certificates according to the\nincoming trust list.\n\nThe marchalling/unmarshalling of the certificateRequest message is wrong, meaning that\nit only works in the case where the server\nelects to send no trust list.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. configure a lighttpd to require client certs signed by a certain CA:\n$SERVER[\u0026quot;socket\u0026quot;] == \u0026quot;0.0.0.0:443\u0026quot; {\n    ssl.engine                 = \u0026quot;enable\u0026quot; \n    ssl.verifyclient.activate  = \u0026quot;enable\u0026quot; \n    ssl.verifyclient.enforce   = \u0026quot;enable\u0026quot;\n    ssl.ca-file = \u0026quot;ca.pem\u0026quot;  \u0026lt;-- cert of CA that signed the client cert\n}\n\n2. use get.go (attached) to try to fetch something, you will get a handshake error\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nGo's client certificate support should work.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nHandshake error, and when the unmarshaler is fixed, the HTTPS client does not send the\ncert due to the simple check for len(trust list)==0.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g and 8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nLinux\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\n10679\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2521/0/get.go\"\u003eget.go\u003c/a\u003e (596 bytes)",
