For instance, if the code would have been\r\n```\r\nfunc main() {\r\n   for := \"f\"; g(); {}\r\n   // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nit's not even clear what the error should be: When the compiler sees the `for` it assumes a `for` loop, and the error might be that there's a missing identifier after the `for`. Or it might be that `for` was taken as an identifier.\r\n\r\nGiven that Go has only 25 identifiers, it's not unreasonable to assume that Go programmers actually know them all.\r\n\r\nLeaving open for now, in case somebody wants to play with this.",
