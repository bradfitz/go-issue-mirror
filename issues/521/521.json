Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Compile code:\npackage main\nimport \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\n\nfunc main() {\n\tx, y := 2, -5\n\tif x\u0026lt;-y {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\u0026quot;2 is lower than 5.\u0026quot;)\n\t}\n}\n2. Note how it refuses to compile.\n3. Of course, a space between \u0026quot;\u0026lt;\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;-\u0026quot; is the solution, but\ngofmt \ndoesn't see that.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThis might lead to a programming experience similar to the famous space \nin nested templates in C++: we'll need to add a space between \u0026quot;\u0026lt;\u0026quot; and\n\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;. \nIs there any way out, even though we're using yacc?\n\nWhich revision are you using?
