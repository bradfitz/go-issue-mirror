(And because the server didn't\nread the entire request body, it also notes that the connection is to be closed after\nthe response, since it can't reuse that TCP connection....)\n\nWe should also wait to know whether we finished writing the request before we return\nsuccess to from the RoundTripper.\u003c/pre\u003e",
