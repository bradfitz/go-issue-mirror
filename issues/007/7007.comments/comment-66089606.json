In a cross-platform GUI library, you probably want to have separate files for\ndifferent platforms with lots of OS-specific code. But if you want to merely \"n /= 10\"\nfor race build, adding 2 new files does not look like a good solution. Race-ness is a\nminor aspect here, so you don't want to partition your code based on it.\nAnd sometimes aspects overlap, if you have to use different files, you will need N^K of\nthem.\u003c/pre\u003e",
