	"body": "Some programs expect their users to write templates. One of these programs is [`docker-gen`](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen), and one of its users filed issue #14992 as they found the template language too restrictive for what they were trying to do.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, `docker-gen` provided the a template function to let the user do what they wanted (filter a set of structs based on the value of a field, and print something different if no structs with that field set to that specific value are found). That function is documented by the `docker-gen` README:\r\n\r\n\u003e `where $items $fieldPath $value`: Filters an array or slice based on the values of a field path expression `$fieldPath`. A field path expression is a dot-delimited list of map keys or struct member names specifying the path from container to a nested value. Returns an array of items having that value.\r\n\r\nThe `docker-gen` program provides many such functions (see the [README](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen/blob/master/README.md) for the full list). Some of them are specific to `docker-gen`'s purpose, but many of them are general purpose (such as `where` above).\r\n\r\nShould we add some of these functions (or functions with similar behavior) to the built in set of template functions?\r\n\r\ncc @robpike @bradfitz @JonasT",
