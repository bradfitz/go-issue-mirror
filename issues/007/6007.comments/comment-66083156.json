If we use wall time we get weirdness like this when the\ncomputer's reported wall time jumps around. If we use some other kind of monotonic \"time\nsince boot\" time, then things like:\n\nt := time.Now()\ntime.Sleep(10*time.Minute)\nfmt.Println(time.Since(t))\n\ncan literally print any value, something arbitrarily far from 10 minutes, even a\nnegative number.\n\nI don't think there's anything we can do here that is significantly better than what we\nhave.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
