It will not have\nmonotonic timers on OS X, Windows, and NetBSD. The 1.3.x updates will not change this\n(they are only for critical bug fixes, not new features).\n\nThe marking as Release-None means that we are not planning to do the work for OS X,\nWindows, or NetBSD ourselves in any particular release.\n\nMore generally, it is fine if someone wants to send in CLs working on a Release-None\nissue; the tag just means that we won't plan to. It is also fine to comment on a\nRelease-None issue and explain why you think the issue is important enough to be worth\ntargeting to a specific release.\u003c/pre\u003e",
