E.g. as in the above examples, you start a ticker for 1 secs, set back the OS timer a few hours, and the ticker will never fire (at least not until the OS time reaches the original ticker time).\n\n  And to give you two real-world examples when this happens: daylight saving (OS updates the date, all tickers pause for an hour). The other is what I got hit with: you boot up the OS, automatically start a Go program, and after a while the clock syncs up and all tickers within the program get corrupted (and this is what actually happens on Google Compute Engine VMs).\n\nCheers,\n  Peter\u003c/pre\u003e",
