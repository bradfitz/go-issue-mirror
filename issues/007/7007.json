This is\nfrequently needed to disable tests, reduce number of iterations or scale timeouts.\nSee e.g.:\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/44180043/diff/60001/src/pkg/runtime/pprof/pprof_test.go\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/44180043/diff/60001/src/pkg/runtime/pprof/pprof_test.go\u003c/a\u003e\nwhere we have to completely disable the test, while we want to do it only under race\ndetector.\n\nDavid noted that this is a more general problem, and proposed to extend it to all build\ntags, e.g.:\nif runtime.Tag(\u0026quot;race\u0026quot;) { ... }\u003c/pre\u003e",
