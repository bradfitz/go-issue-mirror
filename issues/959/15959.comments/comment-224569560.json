This flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.\r\n\r\nI'd be a little concerned that this would be confusing if not provided in the other supported systems, but then I actually didn't realize till now that you actually could use hg, svn etc, so perhaps if you're using those you also know to look for some inconsistencies as the masses swarm git.",
