I\ndon't know of any other way even on new systems.\n\nI think that means that we need a runtime function for this, to reset the signal handler\nfor some core-dumping signal (e.g., SIGABRT) to the default, and then to send that\nsignal to the process.\n\nAlternatively, we could avoid installing a signal handler for SIGABRT, and leave it\navailable to generate a core dump.  I think it's unusual for a program to want to handle\nSIGABRT in any other way.\u003c/pre\u003e",
