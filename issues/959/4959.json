I'd like a way to get core dumps generated for later analysis with gdb, using some\ngo call.\n\nSomething similar to what a null pointer resolution would do in a C program; running\nthat program in a proper environment will dump a core file for analysis.\n\nThread related to this: \u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/forum/#\u003c/a\u003e!topic/golang-nuts/ZK720ICum8E\u003c/pre\u003e",
