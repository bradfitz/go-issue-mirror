The post also mentions the Edge browser (the default Microsoft browser) and comments suggest it hasn't been updated. I haven't tried.\r\n\r\n\u003e As to CL 21140, I think it breaks existing valid programs.\r\n\r\nhttps://golang.org/doc/go1compat says \"A security issue in the specification or implementation may come to light whose resolution requires breaking compatibility. We reserve the right to address such security issues.\"\r\n\r\nI believe calling `syscall.LoadDLL(\".\\\\foo.dll\")` is unchanged in behavior, if people really need to use the standard library to load DLLs out of the current directory.\r\n\r\n\u003e If you think there is something for us to fix here, perhaps we could create new syscall.LoadSystemDLL (or similar) that does what you want, and change all standard packages to use syscall.LoadSystemDLL.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to add that not to the standard library, but to x/sys. (See the original comment at the top of this bug).\r\n",
