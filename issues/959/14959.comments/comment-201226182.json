I went to the page pointed by the article which is suppose to automatically download malicious DLL, but my Chrome actually refused to download the DLL. Chrome told me that DLL looks suspicious and I shouldn't be downloading it.\r\n\r\nAs to CL 21140, I think it breaks existing valid programs. Somehow CL assumes that syscall.LoadDLL is onle used to load \"system\" DLLs. But that is not true. It is quite common to put application specific DLLs into  application directory - directory where executable is located. How do you propose we handle this scenario if CL 21140 is accepted?\r\n\r\nIf you think there is something for us to fix here, perhaps we could create new syscall.LoadSystemDLL (or similar) that does what you want, and change all standard packages to use syscall.LoadSystemDLL.\r\n\r\nAlex",
