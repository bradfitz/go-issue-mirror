Maybe it can write to stdout, or crash the process with a certain error code.\r\n\r\n@mattn, could you provide such a minimal DLL \u0026 source code? From https://github.com/golang/go/issues/14959#issuecomment-202064402 it looks like you know how to make them easily. I only have gomote+trybots for Windows testing. I don't have a Windows development machine at the moment. I found some information online about how to generate Windows DLLs from Linux which I can try otherwise.\r\n\r\nOne DLL is probably fine, but maybe a 32-bit one and a 64-bit one would be better?",
