I think this is preferable to hard coding a thread stack size in `runtime/cgo` or the `runtime` tests, as I'm sure no matter what value we choose it'll be wrong for someone, and they'll be mad that we took away the one configuration knob (ulimit) that they had.\r\n\r\nI'm going to assign this to @rsc to decide, but my recommendation is not make a code change, and instead advise rpi owners to use ulimit instead. I can do a blog post to explain the situation.\r\n\r\ncc @ajstarks ",
