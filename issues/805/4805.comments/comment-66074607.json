We like the model, even if we still occasionally find bugs, and parts\naren't as tuned as we'd like.  Please report specific bugs, though.  See \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/5323\"\u003eissue #5323\u003c/a\u003e for\nan example of a specific reported bug being filed and fixed.  We want to fix them.\u003c/pre\u003e",
