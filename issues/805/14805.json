	"title": "proposal: official struct tag registry",
	"body": "**Problem**: Due to increased usage of Go and thus Go struct tags, clashes become inevitable.\r\n**Proposed Solution**: Offer an IANA like registry for struct tags for publically available projects/libraries.\r\n\r\n**Background**: \r\n\r\nGo offers [struct tags](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Tag) which are discoverable via [reflection](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#StructTag). These enjoy a wide range of use in the standard library in the JSON/XML and other encoding packages. The community welcomed them and build ORMs, further encodings, flag parsers and much more around them.\r\n\r\nSince esp. while handling encodings and ORMs [single sourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) data structures is beneficial for data structures.",
