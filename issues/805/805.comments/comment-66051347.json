I've got a workaround, but it is s...l...o...w.\n\nI'm digging into this from the bottom up now. The Go distro has test netchan_test.go.\nRunning as separate processes I get the behaviour documented in \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/790\"\u003eissue #790\u003c/a\u003e of last\nmessage not being sent and receiver hanging as it doesn't see the close from the sender.\nThis can be fixed by the exporter (sender) calling Drain, but then the reader sees the\nclosing 0 (for ints) or \"\" (for strings) (couldn't find the bug report I saw for this).\n\nIf the sender closes without Drain, then the reader doesn't see closed. Importer doesn't\nhave a Drain method so can't successfully signal closure to a reader. This requires\nseparate processes to demonstrate, not goroutines.\n\nSo... Importer needs a Drain method at least.\u003c/pre\u003e",
