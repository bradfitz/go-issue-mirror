This is really just an inconvenience. It can be hacked around\nwith r.URL.Host = r.Host\nr.URL.Fragment is empty\nr.URL.Scheme is empty.\n\nThese were tested using localhost, so I could understand if Host wasn't set (though, I\nthink it probably should be), but Scheme should really be set.\n\nThis is relatively simple to reproduce. Just set up a handler for http.ListenAndServe\nand check what's set in r.URL.\u003c/pre\u003e",
