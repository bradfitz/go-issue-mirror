	"body": "Our builders for the most part only run on Haswell CPUs on Google Compute Engine.\r\n\r\nA number of Go packages in the standard library and runtime use assembly to choose alternate paths depending on the capabilities of the processor.\r\n\r\nI feel like we're not getting good test coverage, only testing the Haswell paths.\r\n\r\nWe do have a GOARCH=386 builder, though, which is at one extreme, but there are a number of steps in the middle untested.\r\n\r\nCan we put an abstraction over CPUID etc somewhere (unexported) such that the builders can fake it before assembly code can?\r\n\r\n/cc @ianlancetaylor @minux @adg ",
