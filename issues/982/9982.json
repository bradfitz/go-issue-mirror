	"body": "Hi Folks,\r\n\r\nOne of our virtual machine name is pdx-srv2012-wv01. And os.Hostname(..) return hostname as pdx-srv2013-wv0 in this case. The native hostname.exe of windows from sysinternals return the right hostname. It looks like the implementation in GO seem to use GetComputerName(..) instead of GetComputerNameEx(..) to return the NetBIOS name. Is there any reason for it? Can we change this to return the dns hostname as NetBIOS seem to be getting old with later version of windows?\r\n\r\nThe version of GO I am using is 1.3.\r\n\r\n-Karthik",
