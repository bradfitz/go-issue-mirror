	"body": "Still not reproducible. Could you provide me more information by running `gomobile build -target=ios -x`? I am not sure if I am building it against the same iOS SDK version you do.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, I found another bug that might be relevant.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the Audio sample.\r\n2. Open the system wide settings bar by sliding from the bottom.\r\n3. Resume playing the current song.\r\n4. Return back to the Audio app, there is no sound.\r\n\r\nIt behaves normally when I switch to the Music app and resume the playback there.\r\n\r\nKilling the app and relaunching it is the only way to get the OpenAL playback back. Could you be experiencing the same problem?",
