I will run them today and update the ticket. \r\n\r\nBTW, we are still using go 1.2 and doesn't want to upgrade for our current product release, so I just applied the code upstream into our custom package's Hostname() and added a similar nightly build test to  inform when the result between os.Hostname(..) and custom package's  Hostname(..) match for machine name greater than 15 characters.  This will help us to move to your change with go 1.5.",
