It was a compromise to the \"purity\" of the VM because looking at L4 headers is very common, and it requires some annoying math to calculate the IPv4 header length - so the designers put it in as a standalone opcode.\r\n\r\nI'll check the BPF source code for freebsd/netbsd and see if it's implemented there.",
