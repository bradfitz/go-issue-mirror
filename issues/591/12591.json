Code should use context.TODO when it's unclear which Context to use or it's is not yet available (because the surrounding function has not yet been extended to accept a Context parameter). TODO is recognized by static analysis tools that determine whether Contexts are propagated correctly in a program.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that's a search-replace mistake? Wasn't this called something like Root before?",
