And in cases like your example, the\ncompiler must know that s.str is not live, since otherwise it would not know that it\ndoes not have to store it (right?).  So it seems preferable to me to produce more\naccurate live bitmaps.\n\n(It also seems better to not allocate space on the stack that is never set, and it seems\nbetter to not load BX at address 0x56 and then do nothing with the value.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
