If you invoke syscall.ForkExec directly then you need\nto set the Files field in the SysProcAttr struct.  Your program is leaving the Files\nempty, which means that all file descriptors are closed in the child.  You will probably\nwant to set the Files field to something like []int{0, 1, 2}.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
