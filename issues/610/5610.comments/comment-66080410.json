Specifically, do we agree that Go should not be turning a request to set an env\nvar to an empty string into a request to delete an env var?\n\nI am yet to be convinced. For example, someone needs to confirm that what you are trying\nto do (set environment variable to an *empty* string, whatever *empty* means) is\npossible. Also how would I remove environment variable, if that ability is taken away?\nWhat do other OSes do in these situations?\n\n\u003e My key issue continues to be that this corner case Go code os.Setenv(\"AN_ENV_VAR\", \"\")\nbehaves differently on WinXP and Win7.\n\nLets decide on our main problem first, then we could consider this in light of our new\nproposal.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
