The call fails with ERROR_ENVVAR_NOT_FOUND (I have\nused panic(int(err.(syscall.Errno))) to print error number).\n\nI don't see a problem here.\n\nI don't see a problem with Windows telling you that it cannot delete non-existing\nenvironment variable. It thinks you want to delete existing environment variable. As\ndescribed in SetEnvironmentVariable doco\n\u003ca href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/library/windows/desktop/ms686206(v=vs.85).aspx\"\u003ehttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/library/windows/desktop/ms686206(v=vs.85).aspx\u003c/a\u003e: \"... If\nthis parameter is NULL, the variable is deleted from the current process's environment.\".\n\nI don't see problem with Go syscall package passing all that information as expected. \n\nCould you, please, explain again what your problem is? Thank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
