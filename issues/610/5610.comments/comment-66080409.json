Specifically, do we agree that Go should not be turning a request to set an env\nvar to an empty string into a request to delete an env var?\n\nMy key issue continues to be that this corner case Go code\n\n   os.Setenv(\"AN_ENV_VAR\", \"\")\n\nbehaves differently on WinXP and Win7.\n\nPeter: I will swing back and dig into this again, but in the interest of forward\nprogress for pinning down \"correct\" behavior, please post the tests you mentioned in\n\n  \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/9945044#msg8\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/9945044#msg8\u003c/a\u003e\n\nJon\u003c/pre\u003e",
