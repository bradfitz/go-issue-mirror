It's\nclients (at home, behind crappy NAT boxes and crappy ISPs) who need Happy Eyeballs the\nmost, so this is somewhat low priority, even though it'd be fun.\n\nIt's also likely that in a year's time, IPv6 will be much better deployed in the wild. \nIf it gets done before Go 1.2, great, but it shouldn't block Go 1.1.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: removed **go1.1**._",
