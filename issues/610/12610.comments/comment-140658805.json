	"body": "The Chromium test case you linked as [5] shows that Chromium allows a cookie to be set with a domain attribute if that attribute is an exact match (L470-L472 in the same file). \r\n\r\n\u003e RFC 6265 is not really clear here. I read the following\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e\u003e The string is a host name (i.e., not an IP address).\r\n\r\n\u003e RFC 6265 section 5.1.3, second bullet, third star [7] as a definition of host name in\r\n\u003e the sense of: \"a host name is not an IP address\".\r\n\r\nThe third star is so that suffix matching is only applied on host names. 5.1.3 also states that if the two strings matches each other exactly, they domain-match. \r\n\r\nRegarding RFC6265 5.3:\r\n\u003e If the canonicalized request-host does not domain-match the domain-attribute:\r\n\u003e Ignore the cookie entirely and abort these steps.\r\n\r\nIf I visit the URL http://127.0.0.1/ in my browser, it is my understanding that \"the canonicalized request-host\" is \"127.0.0.1\". If the domain-attribute in the Set-Cookie header is set to 127.0.0.1, the canonicalized request-host domain-matches the domain-attribute under the rules of 5.1.3 (exact match).",
