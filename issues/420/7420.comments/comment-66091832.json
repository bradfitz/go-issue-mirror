But before we get to sweepgen += 2, we do some\nallocation which refills the mcache of the thread doing gc.  Then when we do sweepgen +=\n2, we have a span in the cache that hasn't been swept.  Adding a flushallmcaches() just\nbefore sweepgen +=2 gets rid of the fault, although I don't think it is the right\npermanent fix.  Need to sleep on it...\n\nThe bug would be in\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=13f8dc6e750f4ceb744fdd3154f772c5eb5a9382\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=13f8dc6e750f4ceb744fdd3154f772c5eb5a9382\u003c/a\u003e ,\nor at least its interaction with Dmitry's concurrent sweep.  It seems exacerbated by the\nstack copying change, I'm guessing because of the allocations used to shrink stacks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
