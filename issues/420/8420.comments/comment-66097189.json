I've prepared \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/121550043/\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/121550043/\u003c/a\u003e to make use\nof this in cgo.\n\nIt also looks like -Werror=unused-variable has been supported since GCC 4.2, so it\nshould be available on OS X and BSD too.  Though even if we wanted to support an\nold-timey platform using an older GCC, we could just add an appropriate \"// +build\n!openbsd,vax\" line to issue8420.go.\n\nsnyh: Can you please confirm whether the above CL adequately addresses your needs?\u003c/pre\u003e",
