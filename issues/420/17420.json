	"body": "Hi, this is a proposal for a new function in the sync package.\r\n\r\nThis is a small pattern I use with WaitGroup to wait for a group of go routines that I repeat for almost every go program I write. I have been copy-pasting it around until recently, now it's tiny library:\r\nhttps://github.com/anderejd/syncext\r\n\r\nIs there something similar in the standard library already? Am I going about this all wrong? It's just 14 lines of code, but to me that means 14 lines less to write every time I want to use this pattern.\r\n\r\nThe details of the proposal including a use case is in README.md in the repos.\r\n\r\nAny kind of feedback welcome! :)",
