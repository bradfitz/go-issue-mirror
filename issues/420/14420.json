	"body": "When profiling the reproducer for #14406 with \"go version go1.6 linux/amd64\", stack shrinking off, and numactl disabling memory migration, I see calls to `runtime.gcResetMarkState` as called by `runtime.gcStart` in nearly all sampled stacks that include `runtime.gcStart`.\r\n\r\nThe lines reported by GODEBUG=gctrace=1 show sweep termination durations of around 30ms when running with 1e6 goroutines. It looks like the sequential processing of `runtime.allgs` is responsible for these long pauses.\r\n\r\nFull gctrace output is in #14406\r\n```\r\ngc 22 @96.880s 3%: 38+203+129 ms clock, 1220+0/1681/4936+4139 ms cpu, 1266-\u003e1276-\u003e656 MB, 1293 MB goal, 36 P\r\n```\r\n\r\n@aclements \r\n",
