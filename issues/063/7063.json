	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Call runtime.SetCPUProfileRate(0) *with* the profiler already off (I.e. no previous\ncalls to runtime.SetCPUProfileRate).\n2. A crash due to nil pointer dereference occurs.\n3. Example (also happens on playground): \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/whHf24PCI5\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/whHf24PCI5\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe program should run without crashing.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\npanic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference\n[signal 0xb code=0x1 addr=0x0 pc=0x4052ca]\n\ngoroutine 1 [running]:\nruntime.panic(0x4ab880, 0x5a1d48)\n\t/home/stephen/go/src/pkg/runtime/panic.c:264 +0xb6\nmain.main()\n\t/home/stephen/Desktop/godev/src/code.google.com/p/goprof/cmd/goprof/goprof.go:24 +0x2e\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nI tested the same program and it crashed on the playground as well as my personal\nlinux/amd64 and windows/amd64 intel i7 machine.\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nTip in both test cases - go version devel +36d5461843ce\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nMaybe a test should be added for this too; since I think runtime/pprof is the only\nclient who uses this function in the standard library? I'm not sure.\u003c/pre\u003e",
