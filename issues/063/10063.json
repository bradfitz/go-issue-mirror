	"body": "When using a toolkit that needs to use build tags (such as appengine), several tools in golang.org/x/tools/cmd become useless (godoc, gorename, etc.) become useless because they don't take build tags as arguments and ignore all of your source files.\r\n\r\nIf build's defaultContext() read build tags from an environment variable (e.g. $GOTAGS), all of these tools would support projects that use build tags. This is much cleaner and easier to deal with than adding a -tags option to every one of these commands.",
