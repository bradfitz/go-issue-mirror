	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)? 17396575135ba71472ab8a5b82f31af50d8bf312\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)? not important\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nLooking at https://github.com/golang/go/blob/17396575135ba71472ab8a5b82f31af50d8bf312/src/cmd/vet/print.go#L359 it seems that there's a new variable initialized called `indexPending`. I believe the correct code should remove that and change the code at https://github.com/golang/go/blob/17396575135ba71472ab8a5b82f31af50d8bf312/src/cmd/vet/print.go#L373 to check for `state.indexPending` instead of `indexPending` as it does right now.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nNot sure what that will impact, hopefully nothing.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nEither a possible leftover or a possible bug / inconsistency.\r\n\r\n",
