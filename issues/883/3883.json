	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the\nlatest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Use Mac OS X Chrome Version 22.0.1215.0 dev\n2. Go to \u003ca href=\"http://tour.golang.org/\"\u003ehttp://tour.golang.org/\u003c/a\u003e\n3. Click anywhere below 'import \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;'\n4. Insert or delete a character\n5. The entire editor buffer goes blank\n6. The same thing happens at \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/\u003c/a\u003e, but there is a simple mode link in\nthe corner that works around the editor problem.\n7. The tour site needs that simple mode link, and for it to persist for the entire tour\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nNormal editor behavior\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nEditor went blank (if you hit %A you can see it, but then the editor is broken)\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nunknown\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nMAC OS X 10.7.4, 1; Chrome Version 22.0.1215.0 dev\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nunknown\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nVery off-putting for the very first thing to I try to fail.\nThe sort of thing that makes people say \u0026quot;Go is not ready\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e",
