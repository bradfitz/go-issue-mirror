	"body": "1.4 isn't an LTS release. We release 1.4.3 because to address security issues close to the release of 1.5, and since 1.5 contains significant changes to the runtime we felt it wasn't right to force people to upgrade to a new major release to get those security fixes.\r\n\r\n1.4 is not necessary for bootstrapping. You can bootstrap with any version of Go beyond 1.4. And it's not necessary to include vet for bootstrapping, either.\r\n\r\nThe fix to this issue is to restore the functionality to include vet from the tools repo to the x/build/cmd/release tool, but I just don't see it being worth the time to fix it at this point.",
