	"body": "We do not (yet?) support non-interactive apps. An all-Go app is an android Activity. An Activity interacts with the user, usually on the whole screen, sometimes on part of it. It gets something to draw on.\r\n\r\nThe program you are describing is, in android terms, a background service. An implementation of a background service is significantly different than what we have for all-Go apps. It doesn't have an Activity subclass, it doesn't get an icon on the screen (unless it's bundled as an app with an activity to start). Some further documentation:\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/run-background-service\r\n\r\nTo build non-interactive apps that fit well within the android ecosystem requires far more design and implementation than draining the event channel. It requires the packaged program not be built on top of an Activity.\r\n\r\n(As an aside: doesn't the reworked sensor package write to the event channel? Presumably you will be reading from it. The program will still be reported as not responding because of the current implementation of onNativeWindowRedrawNeeded, but even with that \"fixed\" so that apps that fail to draw are not caught by the OS, that's not enough to say we support non-interactive android programs.)",
