	"body": "FWIW, I'm with crawshaw on this one. You might not need to handle lifecycle or paint events, but you should still receive on the events channel. I believe that this minimal app should work:\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n        app.Main(func(a app.App) {\r\n                for range a.Events() {\r\n                }\r\n        })\r\n}\r\n\r\nIt might not work with the current paint.Event / a.EndPaint painting implementation, but I suspect that it should work with my proposed paint model.\r\n\r\nAs for if it's possible to drain the channel if there is not a subscriber? I don't think it's easy to do, and even if it would, it probably would make the API more complicated, and most likely make 'normal' app code more complicated. As crawshaw said, the app package is for what Android calls Activities, not background services, and any useful Activity should respond to events.",
