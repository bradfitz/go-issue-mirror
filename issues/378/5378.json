	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI wrote a hacky little link checker for godoc a couple weeks ago to crawl localhost\ngodoc and look at all local links and #fragments and verify they're good.  That's what I\nused for sending off all the broken link CLs.\n\nI'm attaching it here so I don't lose it, but it's not good clean or well-designed\nenough to submit yet. It evolved very organically and rushed, racing time before I had\nto shut down all portable electronics and return my tray table to its upright and stowed\nposition.\n\nIt'd be nice to run this in the future before releases, or periodically, to make sure we\ndon't break #fragments (like #hdr- ones) in the future.  I also think we'll eventually\nneed some JavaScript to redirect fragments if we change our sub heading text.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5378/0/linkcheck.go\"\u003elinkcheck.go\u003c/a\u003e (3068 bytes)",
