You're right, I shouldn't have closed\nit, I should have turned it into a gccgo bug.\n\nGccgo accepts this because when the parser sees Int{0} it knows that Int is a type, so\nit knows how to parse the code.  If the definition of Int is moved after the function,\ngccgo produces some rather horrible parse errors, pretty similar to 6g actually.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **gccgo**, removed **priority-triage**._",
