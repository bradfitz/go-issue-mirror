	"body": "Hmmm, sorry, it already does that.  But I guess the problem is that cmd/vet doesn't know about the installsuffix.\r\n\r\nI see: the `buildModeInit` functions sets an install suffix of `\"shared\"` as the default for several targets: \"android/arm\", \"android/arm64\", \"android/amd64\", \"android/386\", \"darwin/arm\", \"darwin/arm64\".  For \"darwin/arm\" and \"darwin/arm64\" it's odd that not passing a `-buildmode` option is not the same as passing an explicit `-buildmode=archive` or `-buildmode=exe` option.  I'm not sure what the right fix is.  If we are always going to pass `-shared` to the compiler, then perhaps we should not be setting the install suffix in that case.",
