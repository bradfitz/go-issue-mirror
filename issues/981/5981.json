	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nTry to run an httptest.Server on play.golang.org, e.g.\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/SmkSnOoyAC\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/SmkSnOoyAC\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nSuccess.\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\npanic: httptest: failed to listen on a port: permission denied\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nIt would be useful to be able to use httptest.Server on play to be able to display\nbehavior of the net/http library itself, behavior that httptest.ResponseRecorder cannot\ncapture because it does not pass through the full net/http stack. I could have used it\nto provide standalone \u0026quot;just hit Run\u0026quot; play samples in three recent issues\n(#5953, #5955, #5979).\n\nGiven that httptest.Server uses the local loopback interface, I don't see any obvious\nsecurity problems with enabling it.\n\nApologies if this is not the right forum for play-related issues.\u003c/pre\u003e",
