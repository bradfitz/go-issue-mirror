	"body": "I agree that it adds complexity.\r\n\r\nI considered the product of non-streaming `go test -json` to become a standard format of test result files in Go. For example, they could be stored for future analysis. I assume that's why Version, Arch, etc were put by @rsc in the first place. It would be nice if the standard file format is valid JSON.\r\n\r\nIf `go test -json` output is ultimately to be processed further by another tool (not for storage), then I don't see a reason to include Version, Arch, etc because their values are obvious at the time of the test run.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the standard test results file format could be defined by a separate tool that aggregates `go test -json` streamed output.\r\n\r\nSo, I propose to always stream, simplify output format and exclude Version, Arch, OS and Hostname.",
