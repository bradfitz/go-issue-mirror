For our tool (https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin) it would be better to separate log and test-finished events. So we'll be able to show output before test finished and we'll be able to separate output between tests which were run in parallel. E.g. like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \"name\": \"TestFoo\", \"event\": \"started\" }\r\n{ \"name\": \"TestBar\", \"event\": \"started\" }\r\n{ \"name\": \"TestFoo\", \"event\": \"log\", properties: {\"message\": \"some test output\"} }\r\n{ \"name\": \"TestBar\", \"event\": \"finished\", \"properties\": {\"state\": \"pass\", \"T\": 1000000} }\r\n{ \"name\": \"TestFoo\", \"event\": \"finished\", \"properties\": {\"state\": \"pass\", \"T\": 1000000} }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be even better to allow clients to implement their own reporterts and attach them to `gotest` as shared libraries.",
