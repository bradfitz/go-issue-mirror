With `Version` right in `Result`, it is not obvious from reading the struct definition 1) whether `Version` may be present together with `Test`? 2) Should a user ignore `Version` if it is different from the previous value?\r\n\r\nAlso having `Start` and `End` fields as structs clearly signifies current stage. \r\n",
