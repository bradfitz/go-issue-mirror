Thank you.\r\n\r\n@rsc a clean solution could be to use an extra fd exclusively for test binary json output (assuming nothing else in the test binary would write to it). If a test binary crashes in the middle of writing JSON, the go command can safely discard invalid JSON and report anything printed to test binary's stderr.\r\n\r\n`exec.Cmd.ExtraFiles` is not supported on Windows ATM. I will see if I can fix that. This proposal may have to be postponed until that is done.",
