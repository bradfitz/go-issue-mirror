	"body": "@zolotov re plugins: I like the idea in general, but it is a bit abstract ATM. Are you proposing to limit the plugin to customization of `go test`'s output? A plugin could do more. For example, perhaps in your case a plugin could leave `go test` output alone, but subscribe to all test events (test started, test finished, etc) and stream them directly to IDEA in IDEA-specific format via a channel most convenient for IDEA. However, I don't know if you would like to have it or not. I personally don't see much value in plugins that are limited to output customization.\r\n\r\nI also wonder what others think.",
