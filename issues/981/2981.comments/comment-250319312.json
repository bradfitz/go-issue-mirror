Non-JSON format has indentation by which you can tell whether a test is named \"A/B\" or \"B\" in \"A\". Let me copy @zolotov's message here:\r\n\r\n\u003e How to distinguish third-level subtest and second-level subtest with a slash in the name? E.g. `TestFoo/Bar/Buzz1` and `TestFoo/Bar/Buzz2` in the following example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc TestFoo(t *testing.T) {\r\n\tt.Run(\"Bar/Buzz1\", func(t *testing.T) { })\r\n\tt.Run(\"Bar\", func(t *testing.T) {\r\n\t\tt.Run(\"Buzz2\", func(t *testing.T) {})\r\n\t})\r\n}\r\n\r\nAt the moment, `go test` prints them with different indents:\r\n--- PASS: TestFoo (0.00s)\r\n    --- PASS: TestFoo/Bar/Buzz1 (0.00s)\r\n    --- PASS: TestFoo/Bar (0.00s)\r\n        --- PASS: TestFoo/Bar/Buzz2 (0.00s)\r\n```",
