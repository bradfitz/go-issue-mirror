I was hoping to solve this issue by filing a proposal to prohibit \"/\" in subtest/subbenchmark names, but looks like \"/\" is supported intentionally and it would be a breaking change. \r\n\r\nI am thinking to add `NestLevel int` to JSONResult` which, if not zero/empty, means that a test/benchmark belongs to a parent printed earlier. E.g.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n// Test A started\r\n{\r\n    \"Package\": \"github.com/user/repo\",\r\n    \"Name\": \"TestComposite\",\r\n    \"State\": \"RUN\",\r\n    \"Procs\": 4\r\n}\r\n// Subtest B in A started\r\n{\r\n    \"Package\": \"github.com/user/repo\",\r\n    \"NestLevel\": 1,\r\n    \"Name\": \"B\",\r\n    \"State\": \"RUN\",\r\n    \"Procs\": 4\r\n}\r\n// B passed\r\n{\r\n    \"Package\": \"github.com/user/repo\",\r\n    \"NestLevel\": 1,\r\n    \"Name\": \"B\",\r\n    \"State\": \"PASS\",\r\n}\r\n// Subtest \"B/C\" in A started\r\n{\r\n    \"Package\": \"github.com/user/repo\",\r\n    \"NestLevel\": 1,\r\n    \"Name\": \"B/C\",\r\n    \"State\": \"RUN\",\r\n    \"Procs\": 4\r\n}\r\n// B/C passed\r\n{\r\n    \"Package\": \"github.com/user/repo\",\r\n    \"NestLevel\": 1,\r\n    \"Name\": \"B/C\",\r\n    \"State\": \"PASS\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nit relies on the fact that a test does not finish until all of its subtests finish.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to make `Name` a list of strings and print absolute name each time, e.g. `[\"A\", \"B\"]`, `[\"A\", \"B/C\"]`, but name array looks odd to me. WDYT? cc @aclements who raised the question of subtests earlier",
