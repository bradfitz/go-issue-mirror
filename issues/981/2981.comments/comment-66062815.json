It cannot clear test.v, though, because tests\nmight use testing.Verbose() (which looks at test.v) to decide how much\nlog output to generate, and we do want to generate that output (and\nsave it into the JSON).\n\nThe go command will need to know about the json flag regardless, in\norder to turn -json into -test.json. When in that mode, it should\nsynthesize its own Result built containing all the TestResults and\nBenchmarkResults from the individual packages. The ability to do this\nis the reason that Package appears in each TestResult/BenchmarkResult\ninstead of in the top-level Result.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
