In addition, having a specified format for\nthe benchmark data would be good as well.  What I'm trying to put together is a system\nwhere not only do I have historical information from build to build on unit tests \u0026\ncoverage data, but also information on how the performance of my code has gotten better\nor worse over time.  That way, we know ahead of time if some new feature/bug fix impacts\nperformance and we can go through a new round of capacity planning if necessary.\n\nThanks\u003c/pre\u003e",
