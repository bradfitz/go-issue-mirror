	"body": "re [Benchmark Name Configuration](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/14313-benchmark-format.md#benchmark-name-configuration): I think it should be extracted to a separate proposal, so it can be \"inherited\" by both this proposal and #14313. I can do it.\r\n\r\nMoreover I see [testing package recommends](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Subtests_and_Sub_benchmarks) to use `=`, not `:`.\r\n\r\n**Update**: actually perhaps there is no point in filing a proposal since testing package already established the subtest/subbenchmark name format, that is `=` as key-value separator. Consumers of`go test` output should try to parse key-value pairs out from benchmark/test names regardless of whether output is text or JSON. If I owned #14313 I'd remove \"Benchmark Name Configuration\" section.",
