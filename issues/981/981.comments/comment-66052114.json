On the other hand,\nyou get the nice property that after reading \n\n   func f()\n\non a line by itself any tool (say, an interactive interpreter)\nknows the function declaration is over and doesn't need\nto keep reading.\n\nChanging the rules would mean making them more\ncomplicated.  I don't see this happening any time soon,\nbut it's still an experiment.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
