	"body": "@jucie, thank you for testing. It seems to me that netsh does not display any addresses for interfaces that are disabled. So your CL 18711 to skip appropriate tests sounds like a good solution for this issue. One thing that still puzzules me is (see your output above):\r\n```\r\nnet_windows_test.go:433: Local Area Connection* 13: unexpected addresses list [\"169.254.129.89/16\" \"fe80::85ef:998a:25c7:8159\"], want [\"fe80::85ef:998a:25c7:8159\"]\r\n```\r\n\"169.254.129.89/16\" is returned by Go net library for your \"Local Area Connection* 13\" network interface. Given that netsh displays no such address, where does this address come from? @mikio ? @jucie, did you had this address configured / used in the past? If so, how is this address of any use to anyone? @mikio ? Perhaps we should return no address if interface is down?\r\n\r\nAlex",
