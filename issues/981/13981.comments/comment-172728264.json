That means that it's possible for netsh command to veil IPv4 addresses which are not important for non-IP infrastructure applications with its display filters even on an interface that is operational status is up. I think that addresses displayed by netsh command are a subset of addresses returned from GetAdapterAddresses but not vice versa.",
