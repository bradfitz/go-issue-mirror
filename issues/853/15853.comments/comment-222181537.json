	"body": "I've confirmed that there's a stack growth happening in the middle of stackcacherelease when it calls lock, after it's already picked up the mcache. The stack growth also accesses the mcache, and intertwining the two operations corrupts the mcache. 3be48b4 triggered it because it grew the stack of markroot from 0x68 bytes to 0x70 bytes on the noopt builder, and markroot is on the path to the stackcacherelease when the growth happens (the added argument that grew the markroot stack frame isn't, but that's the noopt builder for you. :)",
