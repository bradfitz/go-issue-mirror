I don't see why GetFileInformationByHandle should succeed here - stdin is not a file, so GetFileInformationByHandle wouldn't have anything interesting to say about it. But Windows 10 implementation might have different ideas.\r\n\r\nI think we should fix this by not calling GetFileInformationByHandle on stdin, stdout and stderr, and returning something reasonable.\r\n\r\nAlex",
