This is what I really want:\n\n#cgo pkg-config: cairo\n\nand that means let cgo run pkg-config however it needs to\n(and it knows how) to learn how to get at the cairo package.\n\nIf cgo ever supported static libraries then maybe\n\n#cgo pkg-config: --static cairo\n\nbut --libs would never be there.  That's something cgo would\nduring one of its invocations of the pkg-config command but\nnot something that the user would ever specify.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
