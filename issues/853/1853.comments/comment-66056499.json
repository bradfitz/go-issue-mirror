The idea\nis somewhat similar in essence to the function concept in make:\n\n    \u003ca href=\"http://www.gnu.org/s/hello/manual/make/Syntax-of-Functions.html\"\u003ehttp://www.gnu.org/s/hello/manual/make/Syntax-of-Functions.html\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\"pkg-config\" would be the only supported function for now, and it would\nexpand to the empty string in case the pkg-config executable isn't found.\u003c/pre\u003e",
