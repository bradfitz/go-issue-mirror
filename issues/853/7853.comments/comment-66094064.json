The code builds a big map at the start,\nwhich grows the heap to ~500MB, with almost all live data.  Once the map is built, it is\ndead data.  The runtime won't know that until the next GC, of course.  As you start\nserving, the heap grows slowly to ~900MB.  This is our heap growth heuristic - growing\nthe heap to double the size of the live data at the last GC.\n\nOnce GC triggers, the live data goes down to ~1MB and stays there.\n\nPre 1.3, it is quite possible that the map stays alive due to conservative scanning of\nstack frames.  In that case the large heap would remain indefinitely.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
