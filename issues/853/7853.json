	"body": "by **ranchev**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eCreate a program that populates a map and start HTTP server. It appears that the size of\nthe map will affect the amount of additional memory needed to serve requests. The memory\ngets reclaimed eventually (many minutes after) but it bloats to almost double while\nserving the requests.\n\nExample (in the sample code set mapSize to 5,000):\n- memory usage after map is populated before serving requests - 3MB\n- after serving some number of requests - 5.5MB\n\nExample (in the sample code set mapSize to 5,000,000):\n- memory usage after map is populated before serving requests - 475MB\n- after serving some number of requests - 910MB\n\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\n1) build and run the provided code, observe memory usage after map is loaded\n2) make enough http calls to it, observe memory after load test (use the ab command to\ngenerate the HTTP requests)\n\nCode to reproduce the issue:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/mOiYuQyPyI\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/mOiYuQyPyI\u003c/a\u003e (also attached with the issue as example.go)\n\nLoad test using:\nab -c 20 -n 500000 \u0026quot;\u003ca href=\"http://localhost:8080/\u0026quot\"\u003ehttp://localhost:8080/\u0026quot\u003c/a\u003e;\n\nVersions of Go observed on:\n1.2\n1.2.1\n1.3 beta - f8b50ad4cac4\n\nAll this was attempted on at least 3 different version of Ubuntu and one Gentoo. All 64\nbit.\n\nExpectations:\nI would expect the memory usage to remain almost unchanged after the map is populated\neven after serving many requests especially given that we don't modify the map nor do we\neven interact with it.\n\nThanks\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/7853/0/example.go\"\u003eexample.go\u003c/a\u003e (382 bytes)",
