Specifically, please look at (open in an editor) the file $GOROOT/pkg/darwin_amd64/errors.a and let me know what the first 20 lines look like. If you find a $$ header followed by textual export data (rather that a $$B header) on line 9, you have stale packages and you should remove the $GOTOOT/pkg directory and recompile your std library.\r\n\r\nIf you have an up-to-date std library (all compiled with latest compiler), please provide more detailed instructions how to recreate this error (which version of golint, other packages installed). Thanks.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that we don't guarantee interoperability of package files between different compiler versions - and it looks like you're working  with a compiler off tip.",
