(And yes, the slowdown is very unfortunate. I am not happy about it either.) All that said, is your program available somewhere? I doubt that there is anything safe that could be done to address it at this point in the release cycle, but if we can reproduce it, that'll help with Go 1.6 speed-up efforts.\r\n",
