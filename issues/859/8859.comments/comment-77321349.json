I now understand that some additional stuff (e.g., pprof_mac_fix) or environment condition to the kernel can easily shake scheduling for uio_vectors and make EAGAIN notifications. That means that assuming netpoll hotpaths sail on calm sea during test is pretty naive. Perhaps permitting netpoll hotpaths allocate a few stuff in TestReadWriteAllocs might make sense.",
