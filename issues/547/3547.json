The uuencoding has\nan '=' in the encoding string, however the base64 package treats '=' specially as it is\nused as padding in standard encoding. Two problems arise from this.\n\n1. If the string to decode ends in one or two '=' an '=', it treats them as padding, and\nreturns a truncated string.\n\n2. If an '=' is in the second to last byte in the string to decode, but not the last, it\nthrows an error\n\nThe following link shows the problem. uustring2 is the typical uuencoding string and\nuustring is the encoding string with a '|' substituted for the '='.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/FPJ0VGcY0k\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/FPJ0VGcY0k\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nlinux\n\nWhich version are you using?
