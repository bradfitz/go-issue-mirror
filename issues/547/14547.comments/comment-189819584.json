I know these; I was just, uh.., doing something stupid, probably.\r\nFor what it's worth, here's the background: I wanted to install godoc to $GOPATH/bin/godoc instead of go get forcing it in to $GOROOT/bin/godoc.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I worked around it:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\ngo get -u -d golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc\r\ngo build -o $GOPATH/bin/godoc golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n..I couldn't find what in-place-of $GOPATH would make the command the *least* platform-dependent (no grep, no sed, etc., as they wouldn't work in windows).\r\n\r\nReally, this is not a big deal, I just reported this template context -problem as there seemed to be a bug in the code. I feel bad to have taken your time and to have bothered you for this long, apologies.",
