I just used the base64\nfunctionality since I could swap out the encoding string, and use the decode function,\nwhich aside from the padding with = is the same exact function.  And since I don't have\nmuch experience with bitwise operations, I figured I'd just reuse the function.\n\nFor now, my quick hack of doing a Replace of ='s with another character before decoding\nis fine. At some point I may make a proper uuencode package.  I'm not sure uuencoding is\nimportant enough to require it to be handled by the standard library.\u003c/pre\u003e",
