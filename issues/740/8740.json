	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCL 12829043 added a compiler pass that merges temporary variables with equal types and\nnon-overlapping lifetimes.\n\nI believe that \u0026quot;equal types\u0026quot; is sufficient but not necessary and that\n\u0026quot;equivalent w.r.t. GC\u0026quot; is both necessary and sufficient. (Please correct me if\nI am wrong!) This should allow more temporaries to be merged, further reducing stack\nusage.\u003c/pre\u003e",
