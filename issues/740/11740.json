	"body": "For some reason the packaging program \"light\" (part of Wix) doesn't like the LICENSE.rtf that we have been using all along. (It complains about invalid characters for the given code page.)\r\n\r\nI've disabled it for the beta, but we should fix it for the 1.5 release. Without LICENSE.rtf the user won't see the project's license when they open the windows installer.",
