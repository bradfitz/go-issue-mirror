	"body": "FWIW, I've brainstormed before about extending Offsetof to take two parameters like C++'s offsetof operator.  Then you could write Offsetof(a, b.c) vs Offsetof(a.b, c) to distinguish intent.\r\n\r\nIt would be a bit awkward though because then \"b\" in Offsetof(a, b) doesn't actually refer to a free variable b.  Not a problem per se, but some tools might need to be aware of that.\r\n\r\nIt also wouldn't work for array indexes since Offsetof(a, [1]) isn't currently valid syntax, but at least Offsetof(T{}, b[1]) would be.",
