Extract attached cgostat.zip\n2. Go to cgostat\\C and run build_lib.bat - this should build you a problematic lib\n3. Go one folder up and try \u0026quot;go test\u0026quot; - it should give you the error. Note\nthat \u0026quot;go build\u0026quot; does not give an error.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nIt must work - these are static symbols and they actually have different names, with a\nunique number after a dot, but the linker somehow seems to ignore these unique\nextensions.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5740/0/cgostat.zip\"\u003ecgostat.zip\u003c/a\u003e (1421 bytes)",
