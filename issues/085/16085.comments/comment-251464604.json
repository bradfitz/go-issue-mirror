That is, how is\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype jsonPerson struct {\r\n    name `json:\"name\"`\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype xmlPerson struct {\r\n    name `xml:\"name\"`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ndifferent from\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Person struct {\r\n    name `json:\"name\" xml:\"name\"`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nfor the purposes of behavioral equivalency? reflect.StrutTag already works this way. Is the idea two conflicting tags with the same key?",
