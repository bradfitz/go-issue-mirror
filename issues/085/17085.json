	"body": "In our gRPC and in HTTP handlers we're using request IDs in headers to correlate the tree of requests that \"spawn\" out of an original request.\r\n\r\nGolang has an awesome `/debug/requests` and `/debug/events`, which are incredibly helpful, especially for gRPC. \r\n\r\nIdeally, we'd move from our custom middleware/interceptors that we use with request ID to propagate (in our internal network) as trace spans. Unfortunately, you cannot read the trace ID in order for it to be serialized into headers. This would make it possible to have a consistent view of request IDs in our logs and `/debug/requests`. \r\n\r\nAlso it would make it easier to ship stuff to ~~Dapper~~[Cloud Trace](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-go/blob/master/trace/trace.go) :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
