	"body": "I just reviewed a PR with the line ```case err.Error() == \"http: can't write HTTP request on broken connection\"```. That's brittle code, and it's hard to test in a way that ensures it stays in sync with any changes to the error message wording in net/http--but there's no way to improve upon it given the errors the http package emits.\r\n\r\nPossible improments:\r\n * net/http could predeclare its errors\r\n * or make a custom error type\r\n\r\nAny mechanism is fine as long as it lets the compiler check that people are referring to the error they intend to.\r\n\r\n(I realize this is probably low priority.)",
