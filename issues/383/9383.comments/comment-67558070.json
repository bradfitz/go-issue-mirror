The server endpoint is using chunked encoding and periodically emitting JSON objects onto the response.  The client has a number of open connections like this (10 or so in the trigger) to the server, and when the server terminates the connection on `ReadTimeout` it appears that all of the open connections are closed in a very short window, and then the clients immediately try to reconnect.  The first client seems to get EOF (reusing the existing connection?), the remainder get a mix of `tcp connection reset by peer` and `http: can't write HTTP request on broken connection`.\r\n\r\nI will create a reduced repro case for the actual 'http: can't write HTTP request'",
