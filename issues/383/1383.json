	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCopyn has two modes: slower using internal buffering, and faster using ReaderFrom\ninterface.\n\nIn the former case, Copyn(dst, src, N) loops until exactly N bytes are copied, or until\nRead or Write error, whichever comes first.\n\nIn the latter case, Copyn(dst, src, N) does not loop.\n\nThis asymmetry means the caller cannot rely on Copyn to always do this looping, which\ninitially struck me as its primary function.\n\nI have a diff that modifies Copyn and all ReadersFrom (only bytes.Buffer really) which I\ncan submit if you agree I've identified the problem correctly.\u003c/pre\u003e",
