	"body": "@kardianos, I wasn't suggesting to switch all your clients to PostgreSQL ;) My intention was to collect use cases that are not possible to implement correctly withput specifying parameter types.\r\n\r\nAfter a bit more digging I found that there are cases when PostgreSQL cannot infer parameter types. For example the following SQL cannot be currently executed using `database/sql`:\r\n\r\n    select date_trunc('hour', $1)\r\n\r\nThis is because there are two `date_trunc` functions in PostgreSQL and without type information it is impossible to choose the function.\r\n\r\n",
