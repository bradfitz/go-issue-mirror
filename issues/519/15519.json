	"body": "I am using\r\n\r\n\u003e go version go1.6.2 darwin/amd64\r\n\u003e gomobile version +c435d0b Wed Apr 27 17:00:39 2016 +0000 (android,ios); androidSDK=\r\n\r\nMy issue is minor and very related to fixed #12590, the crash is fixed, but warning is still there if I try to build my XCode project with gomobile framework, for device like iPad 2 (non-64 bit A5 chip on board)\r\n\r\nThe warning message:\r\n\r\n\u003e ld: warning: PIE disabled. Absolute addressing (perhaps -mdynamic-no-pic) not allowed in code signed PIE, but used in main.init from /Users/... To fix this warning, don't compile with -mdynamic-no-pic or link with -Wl,-no_pie\r\n\r\nThe same build for iPad Pro (64bit A9X on board) is going without any warning.\r\nMy gomobile framework is built with default parameters `gomobile bind -target=ios \u003cpackage\u003e`",
