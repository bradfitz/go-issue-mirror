	"body": "Just a note in support of this proposal:  with encoding/xml as it stands, it is infeasible to interact with SOAP web services that use digitally signed requests.  This is because XML digital signatures require the XML to be in [canonical form](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n), which requires a greater degree of control over namespaces than encoding/xml provides.  Admittedly, calling a SOAP service from a Go program is kind of like towing a trailer behind your Ferrari, but sometimes interoperability with legacy systems is essential.",
