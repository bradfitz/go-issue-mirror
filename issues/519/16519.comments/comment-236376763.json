	"body": "\u003e If I understand my code, only a request will bring it out of that embarrassing state of not flushing its buffers then. It could be any request, really. Maybe insert a dummy one? Sorry about that.\r\n\r\nI thought about sending a dummy OPTIONS request, but then I found it was easier to just not wait for the peer's settings \u0026 settings ACK instead. I hacked that up on the plane ride home. It might be too late for Go 1.7.\r\n\r\n\u003e Started adding go tests into my test suite. Seeing other interop issues, e.g. where Apache sends response HEADER + DATA (eof set) and the go client hangs. No flow involved. And go on http1 works fine.\r\n\r\nFile a new Go bug and post details? I need to setup mod_h2 interop tests on my side too, but do share any Go snippet you find that hangs.\r\n\r\n\u003e Does it makes sense to test with 1.6.2? Will have a closer look next week...\r\n\r\nEither use Go 1.6.2, or use Go 1.6 and just make sure you create your own `*http.Client` instead of relying on the `http.DefaultClient` ... \r\n\r\n```go\r\n     c:= \u0026http.Client{Transport: \u0026http.Transport{}}\r\n     c.Get(....)\r\n```\r\n",
