	"body": "We used to have a simple rule: the build flag -a meant to rebuild all packages even if they were up to date.  We made that flag more complicated by changing it to ignore standard packages for a release build.\r\n\r\nI propose that we restore -a to what it used to be, and add a new flag to ignore standard packages.  Advantages: 1) fixes the original issue by giving people a flag to do what they want; 2) fixes this issue; 3) simplifies the meaning of -a.  Cons: New flag.",
