The original fix is a special case, and\r\nmy proposal just tries to limit its scope:\r\nTo fix the original #8290, we don't need to limit go build -a std.\r\n\r\nYes, this might encourage people to use go build, but sometimes people just\r\nwant to build a one-shot statically linked binary, requiring them to build Go\r\nfrom scratch is too much. (I always use tip, so that problem doesn't affect me\r\nat all, but we've seen more than one issue reports for this problem since 1.4\r\nis released, and this suggests we do need to something here.)\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm among the one that oppose that fix. I think a better solution for #8290\r\nis to support another meta package that means all-std (alternatively, we can\r\nsupport negative package selectors at cmd/go command line, but that's probably\r\ntoo much.)",
