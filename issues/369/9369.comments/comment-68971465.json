In the rare case of multiple GOPATH entries, the procedure\n\u003e can be repeated.\n\u003e\n\u003e I don't know why anyone would need to do this anyway.\n\nI agree. Building Go code is generally so fast that even rebuilding\neverything\neach time will be barely noticeable (unless the program relies on some cgo\npackages.....)",
