	"body": "It would be great if it was easier to write and distribute codewalks as documentation. The codewalk tool in godoc is pretty amazing. Writing a complete usecase of a library and a codewalk explaining it all would be an amazing way to complement testable examples and API documentation.\r\n\r\nThis could either happen by also loading codewalks from GOPATH-packages and showing them in godoc (and on godoc.org) or by factoring them into a separate tool which could then run hosted on appengine similar to go-talks.appspot.com.",
