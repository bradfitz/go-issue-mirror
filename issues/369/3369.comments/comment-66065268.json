When append is used without ..., the compiler\nexpands it to code that grows the slice if necessary and then fills in each new element.\n It appears that the evaluation of the new elements is not done first.  See the append\nfunction in cmd/gc/walk.c.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-go1**, **go1-must**, **compilerbug**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
