Now no matter what happens, at\nleast there's something we can point folks to.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/All_002dStop-Mode.html\"\u003ehttps://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/All_002dStop-Mode.html\u003c/a\u003e seems relevant. It\nappears that it must be set after starting the executable, which can potentially be\nautomated (see e.g. \u003ca href=\"http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/topic,10944.msg75540.html)\"\u003ehttp://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/topic,10944.msg75540.html)\u003c/a\u003e.\nNot sure whether it is something that we could add to runtime-gdb.py or not. Also, given\n\u003ca href=\"http://research.swtch.com/macpprof\"\u003ehttp://research.swtch.com/macpprof\u003c/a\u003e, I somehow doubt it'll be supported on OS X, in which\ncase, I wonder whether the sleep workaround could be added to runtime-gdb.py.\u003c/pre\u003e",
