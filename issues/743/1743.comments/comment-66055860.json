The spec says that \"fields and methods\" of an anonymous field are promoted to be\nfields and methods of the struct.  There is no exception for anonymous fields of\ninterface type.\n\nI actually also don't think this is a LanguageChange, I think it's just a bug in 6g. \ngccgo prints \"Object.f\" twice as expected.\u003c/pre\u003e",
