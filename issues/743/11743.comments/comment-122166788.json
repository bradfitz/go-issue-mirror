It wouldn't be clear in the package's Index, at least.\r\n\r\nChanging the documentation of DecodeRune to \"deprecated: use Decode\" only exchanges awkwardness for clutter.\r\n\r\nCould this be marked Go2? That would be the best time to clean it up all at once and simple renamings are eminently go fix-able.",
