Don't you agree, that the code is relatively easy to misunderstand?\r\n\r\nIt can very well be that it is not the intention that is the source problem, but the line breaks. I will then suggest that gofmt fixes the linebreaks, for example something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        {\r\n            \"empty\", \u0026StructA{\r\n                NestedB: \u0026StructB{},\r\n            },\r\n            \"\",\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```\r\n        { \"empty\",\r\n            \u0026StructA{\r\n                NestedB: \u0026StructB{},\r\n            },\r\n            \"\",\r\n        },\r\n```",
