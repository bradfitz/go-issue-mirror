Every field of a struct literal is at equal indentation, and a greater indentation than its surrounding struct literal.\r\n\r\nIf you look at my CL, I have done something very similar. In particular, @tbertelsen's first suggestion:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        {\r\n            \"empty\", \u0026StructA{\r\n                NestedB: \u0026StructB{},\r\n            },\r\n            \"\",\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is slightly better as it is less intrusive. I would add the minimum number of newlines to avoid the indent confusion. Forcing every field to its own line seems unnecessary to me, especially as `go/printer` would not do that otherwise.\r\n\r\nBy the way, this issue should probably be retitled to concern `go/printer` and not `gofmt`.",
