	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIt would be really nice to expand the reslicing capabilities.\n\nRight now, one can do s[lo:hi] to get the subslice between lo and hi. It would be useful\nif one could also do\n\np := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}\ns2 := s[p]\n\nIt would also be really nice if one could do\ns[lo:2:hi], to take every other element\n\ns[hi:-2:lo], takes every other element in reverse order, etc.\n\nThank you\u003c/pre\u003e",
