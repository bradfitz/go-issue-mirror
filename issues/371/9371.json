	"body": "Version: 1.3.3\r\nOS: Fedora 21 X86_64\r\nSample Code For Reproduction: https://github.com/rfliam/heapdumptest\r\n\r\nIn the above sample code the [WriteHeapDump](http://golang.org/pkg/runtime/debug/#WriteHeapDump) function devolves into an infinite loop, that can only be exited by killing the program. The thread running WriteHeapDump runs at 100% cpu and the function never returns.\r\n\r\nI believe this is the result of a reference loop in the goruntime. This reference loop seems to be made by interfaces which refer to each other in a loop.\r\n",
