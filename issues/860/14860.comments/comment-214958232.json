Port\r\n\r\n   The port subcomponent of authority is designated by an optional port\r\n   number in decimal following the host and delimited from it by a\r\n   single colon (\":\") character.\r\n\r\n      port        = *DIGIT\r\n\r\n   A scheme may define a default port.  For example, the \"http\" scheme\r\n   defines a default port of \"80\", corresponding to its reserved TCP\r\n   port number.  The type of port designated by the port number (e.g.,\r\n   TCP, UDP, SCTP) is defined by the URI scheme.  URI producers and\r\n   normalizers should omit the port component and its \":\" delimiter if\r\n   port is empty or if its value would be the same as that of the\r\n   scheme's default.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003e except in the case of IPv6 literals because they are special in very many ways\r\n\r\nWhat are those ways?\r\n\r\nYou think IPv4 and IPv6 should have different rules now how ports are parsed in Go? That seems very ... surprising.\r\n",
