	"body": "In general package url does not impose structural restrictions on the authority part, because there might be things like fooscheme://whatever:baz/ at some point. The claim is that this new code is for \"IPv4\" but it's really for everything that's not IPv6, including plain names or other text. I've seen people using things like mysql://various(stuff:here) and that should continue working too. (We broke and reverted stuff like that once already.) It had a test (reverted in the CL) to make clear that this kind of thing was supported.\r\n\r\nIPv6 literals _are_ special in URLs: they introduce the special case that % can appear and does not mean the usual \"introduce a %xx escape sequence\", and so they need special handling. (See the big comment. The way IPv6 zone scopes were hacked into URLs is just awful.) But other structural checks are incompatible with the history here and should not be added. That's why the test was there.\r\n\r\nRejecting previously valid inputs is not something we should do lightly, and the CL that did it doesn't seem to understand the full scope of what the existing code did (the mistaken claims about \"IPv4\").\r\n",
