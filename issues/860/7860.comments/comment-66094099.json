This on box of my own, not on Joyents cloud, so\nif compared to them I guess one difference would be a newer platform image. The zone is\na 13.4.1 image with 2GB RAM and no CPU restrictions, single Xeon X3440 on a Supermicro\nbox. I got the same error on an older zone running the 13.1.0 image, but I would anyway\nguess that if it's something in the OS that differs relevantly that would be the base\nimage.\u003c/pre\u003e",
