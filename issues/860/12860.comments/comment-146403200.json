Can you?\r\n\r\nWhether we like it or not, `import \"C\"` is an implicit `cgo` build tag.\r\n\r\nI think the solution here is for the \"no buildable Go source files\" to explain which files were excluded and why. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncan't load package: package foo: no buildable Go source files in /Users/adg/src/foo\r\n    foo.go: no match for build tag 'cgo' \r\n```\r\n",
