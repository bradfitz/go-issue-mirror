Without cgo, in the first case you get the \"no buildable source files\", and in the second the \"undefined\" errors. Both are confusing. They don't tell what the real problem is.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, I only add an empty C file. This results in the error \"C source files not allowed when not using cgo or SWIG\".\r\n\r\nFor this to work in the first case, you have to add an empty Go file as well, one that doesn't import C.",
