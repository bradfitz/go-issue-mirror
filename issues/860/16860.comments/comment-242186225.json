However, it's not clear to me that reproducible builds when the sources are in different directories are essential.\r\n\r\nFor example, exactly the same thing happens when using GCC with the -g option.  The source directory is included in the debug info, in the `DW_AT_comp_dir` attribute.\r\n\r\nNot including the source directory will make debugging more difficult.",
