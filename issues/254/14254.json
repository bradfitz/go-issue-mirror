But that means some sort of new convention here. mksyscall_windows.go would have to be able to resolve win32 into  golang.org/x/exp/shiny/driver/internal/win32. Maybe it can deduce this by looking at imports in syscall_windows.go. But current syscall_windows.go does not import golang.org/x/exp/shiny/driver/internal/win32, so we would have to change that. I am not convinced it is a good approach.\r\n\r\nMaybe do something different.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, David?\r\n\r\n/cc @crawshaw for comments\r\n\r\nAlex",
