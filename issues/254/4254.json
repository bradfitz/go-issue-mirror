	"body": "by **jacobsa@google.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe Rand interface has methods for several types of random integers, including\nuint32 and int63, but no uint64. I need random integers in [0, 2^64). I can of\ncourse use two calls to Uint32 to do what I need, but see discussion here:\n\n    \u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/2a57bcef8953d44a/335e3adb37bb4333\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/2a57bcef8953d44a/335e3adb37bb4333\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIt would be nice to add this for 2.0, or whenever it's next okay to make a\nbreak with the current API.\u003c/pre\u003e",
