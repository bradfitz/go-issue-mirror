I was thinking that it might look like this (to avoid unnecessary confusion):\n\nConstDecl      = \"const\" ( ConstSpec | \"(\" { ShortConstSpec \";\" } \")\" ) .\nConstSpec      = IdentifierList [ Type ] \"=\" ExpressionList .\nShortConstSpec = IdentifierList [ [ Type ] \"=\" ExpressionList ] .\n\nOn second thought, maybe these new rules do not seem like a worthwhile improvement over\nthe rules in the specification.\n\nIf there are no votes from the Go team in favor of adding the ShortConstSpec rule, I\nwould suggest to close this issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
