We could add a few map operations, a channel select, etc. for good measure.\r\n\r\nCan you configure qemu to faithfully emulate a Pentium MMX, missing instruction faults and all?\r\n\r\nJust validating using the disassembler doesn't quite work, as we have non-MMX code guarded by CPUID checks.  Those cases may be few enough in number that we could explicitly suppress errors in those functions.",
