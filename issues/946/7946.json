	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhile net/rpc supports HTTPS trivially in the server, there's no built-in way for a\nclient to connect to one since rpc.DialHTTPPath calls net.Dial itself. With some\nduplicated code from client.go it's possible to create a working DialHTTPSPath in user\ncode, though this is suboptimal since DialHTTPPath references an unexported package\nvariable which must be duplicated.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/100140043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/100140043\u003c/a\u003e implements rpc.DialHTTPS and rpc.DialHTTPSPath\nwhich are exact analogues to DialHTTP and DialHTTPPath apart from also accepting a\ntls.Config. This issue is mainly to track that CL during the 1.3 code freeze.\n\nI originally proposed this at\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/forum/#\u003c/a\u003e!topic/golang-nuts/M0LwsijM9bo; no objections were\noffered.\u003c/pre\u003e",
