If you want, to,\neg, use the GNU tools in \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuWin32\\bin\", add '/c/Program Files\n(x86)/GnuWin32/bin' as the first component in your path, and ./all.bash would use the\ntools there for compiling Go.\n\n(Since I didn't understand why /bin was prepended to the path, I wrote a patch that\nkeeps it prepended. It probably didn't have good enough reason, and now Go installation\nuses whatever is on your path.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
