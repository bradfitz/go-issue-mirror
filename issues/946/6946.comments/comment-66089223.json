The\n#go121 tag in the text isn't sufficient, because we not only need a way to mark issues\nas appropriate for 1.2.1, but we also need a way to remove that marking.  So I'm\nchanging the release tag to Release-Go1.2.1.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.2.1**, removed **release-go1.3**._",
