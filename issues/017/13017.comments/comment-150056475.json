I would gently suggest that you highlight that next time--it's not the common case and it was not obvious in the initial report.\r\n\r\nThe only problematic thing I see in your log is this:\r\n\r\ngcc -c -o interface.o cpp/interface.cpp -Iinclude/\r\n\r\nI don't think that is coming from Go.  I think it's coming from your Makefile.  I think you need to compile that object with the -fPIC option, as the system linker error message suggests.",
