The returned connection c's ReadFrom\n// and WriteTo methods can be used to receive and send UDP\n// packets with per-packet addressing.  The network net must be \"unixgram\".\nfunc ListenUnixgram(net string, laddr *UnixAddr) (*UDPConn, error)\n\nmaybe the original API designers intended to make a protocol bridge \nbtw UDP and Unix or underlying local file read/write, not sure.\n\nIt seems that the latter is already available by FileConn, FileListener \nand FilePacketConn API. The former would be a tough work. So it looks \nthis API is a design orphan and perhaps should be obsoleted in the future\nrelease.\u003c/pre\u003e",
