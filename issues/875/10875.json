	"body": "Here's a sample code to illustrate the problem which stems from a case sensitive string matching somewhere in the code:\r\n\r\n\tpackage main\r\n\r\n\timport (\r\n\t\t\"fmt\"\r\n\t\t\"path/filepath\"\r\n\t)\r\n\r\n\tfunc main() {\r\n\t\ta,_ := filepath.Glob(\"c:\\\\users\\\\*\\\\appdata\")\r\n\t\tfmt.Println(a)  //this prints []\r\n\t\tb,_ := filepath.Glob(\"c:\\\\users\\\\*\\\\AppData\")\r\n\t\tfmt.Println(b)  //this prints [c:\\users\\Default\\Appdata ...]\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nBecause file and directory names in Windows are case insensitive therefore this is a bug.\r\n\r\nPlease note that before the asterisk(*) the path name does not have to match case but after the asterisk it doesn't provide any results if the case doesn't match.",
