But the inverse is\nwell defined as long as the number being inverted and the modulus are relatively prime. \nPerhaps more importantly, the current code seems to work for all of those cases.\n\nShould we relax the spec to include these cases?\nAny reason why the current code wouldn't always work with this relaxation?\u003c/pre\u003e",
