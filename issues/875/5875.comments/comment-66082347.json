In my testing, the client does\nrespond to server keepalive messages as long as I've called Run or Start+Wait on the\nsession.\n\nThe code to reply to global keepalive messages is present in ssh/client.go's mainLoop:\ncase *globalRequestMsg:\n    // This handles keepalive messages and matches\n    // the behaviour of OpenSSH.\n    if msg.WantReply {\n        c.transport.writePacket(marshal(msgRequestFailure, globalRequestFailureMsg{}))\n    }\u003c/pre\u003e",
