What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nI created a client certificate with CN field set to \"test/abc=1234\"\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nchains, _ := mycert.Verify(options)\r\ncn := chains[0].Subject.CommonName\r\n, where mycert is the certificate I created in the above step. I was expecting `cn` to be set to \"test/abc=1234\"\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n`cn` was actually set to \"test\". I lost the trailing part. \r\nHowever, if I do a `openssl x509 -in mycert -text`, I can see the CN field is properly set to \"test/abc=1234\"\r\n\r\n",
