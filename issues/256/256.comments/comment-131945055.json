This would have been first 'can Go link shared libraries?' But on further consideration, if it did use shared libraries how would I use them?\r\nc# doesn't really behave like dlopen/dlsym/et al It instead gives back lists of types that can be queries for support. An alternative available on C# is Attributes; but go has no idea about attributes so it would definitly have to be done with reflection",
