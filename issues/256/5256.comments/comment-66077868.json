E.g., in the\nexample struct, \"rects\" does not have an underscore, so fieldPrefix simply skips over\nit; then the only field it actually considers is \"num_rects\" and (erroneously) concludes\n\"num_\" is a common prefix.\n\nIt would be easy to tweak fieldPrefix to realize that if a struct has fields without any\nunderscores then it doesn't have a 'common prefix'.  Unfortunately, that would cause at\nleast some field names in package syscall to change if they were regenerated; e.g., the\n\"Unit\" field in Sysinfo_t would become \"Mem_unit\".\n\nHowever, now that package syscall is frozen (and presumably won't be regenerated any\nfurther), maybe that's not an issue?  Or maybe we still wouldn't want to change the\nstruct field names even in the new go.sys package?\u003c/pre\u003e",
