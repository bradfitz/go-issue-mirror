	"body": "by **danny.gottlieb**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Have a package with a fully qualified name containing a period. (e.g.\ngithub.com/package or code.google.com/package)\n2. Call a function that generates/prints a stack trace.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nGiven the package name is \u0026quot;github.com/package\u0026quot; and the function name being\ncalled is \u0026quot;foo\u0026quot; (also assuming I understand the intent of the documentation\nlinked to in the \u0026quot;Additional Information\u0026quot; section):\nfoo: debug.PrintStack()\n\nWhat do you see instead?\ncom/package.foo: debug.PrintStack()\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version devel +0adf91947752 Sun Feb 17 02:06:59 2013 +1100 darwin/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nView lines 78 through 87 of \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/src/pkg/runtime/debug/stack.go\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/src/pkg/runtime/debug/stack.go\u003c/a\u003e\n\u0026quot;function\u0026quot; throws everything up to a leading period character to clean up any\nredundant information from printing out the full file path on the previous line. This\nincorrectly truncates early if the fully qualified package name contains a host or\ndomain.\n\nI can supply a code sample on request, but I'm hoping this problem is straightforward\nenough to not warrant one.\u003c/pre\u003e",
