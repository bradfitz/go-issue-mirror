	"body": "FWIW, CL 5312 says it resolves this issue, but it's not clear to me if _meant_ to resolve a subset, or if that was unintentional.\r\n\r\nWhat it resolves is that if a default branch was not master and `master` was not a branch at all, previously, `go get` would produce an error (because it would try to execute `checkout master` in `tagSyncDefault`).\r\n\r\nNow, that error no longer happens because `tagSyncDefault` was made blank.\r\n\r\nHowever, `go get` still gets `master` rather than default branch specified on GitHub. I just want to confirm, that was intended, right? FWIW, I'm okay with that behavior - just want to confirm it's intended.\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to think it's not intentional however. The commit message in CL 5312 says:\r\n\r\n\u003e Furthermore it resolves the Github default branch issue. Changing Github default branch is effectively changing HEAD.\r\n\r\nBut that is not true (about resolving GitHub default branch issue). Here are reproduce steps:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go get github.com/shurcooL-legacy/go-get-default-branch\r\n$ $GOPATH/bin/go-get-default-branch\r\nmaster branch (not default branch)\r\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/shurcooL-legacy/go-get-default-branch\r\n$ git branch\r\n  another-branch\r\n* master\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, that repo is configured to have `another-branch` as the default branch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/shurcooL-legacy/go-get-default-branch\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1924134/11766430/1778a42a-a13c-11e5-8eff-2b008a640462.png)\r\n\r\nI'm running `go version go1.5.2 darwin/amd64` and `git version 2.5.4 (Apple Git-61)`.\r\n\r\n(I'm only reporting this because it was on my TODO list to investigate the possible discrepancy between the commit message in this CL and actual behavior.)",
