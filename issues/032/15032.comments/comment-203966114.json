	"body": "SGTM, FWIW. Instruction selection probably may as well use Simsimtype anyway. And if that doesn't work, we can always check Widthptr inside a single Tptr case. However, before doing this, I'd say we should route as many TPTR32/TPTR64 checks through methods (IsPtr) and add a dynamic width test there. Just because the compiler *should* be indifferent doesn't mean it is. Every bit of code we clean up (named types, refactoring, field encapsulation) yields bugs, and I'd rather discover those bugs in a way that gives us nice stack traces.",
