UMS/sleep implementation needs to be chosen at startup depending on presence of necessary syscalls.\r\n\r\nBut FWIW 2003 appeared before multi-core era and is so inefficient in lots of other fields, so I would not spend too much time on top performance on it. If you care about performance, updating to a newer OS should be the first step.\r\n\r\n",
