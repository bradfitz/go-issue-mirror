Run `obcopy` to rename `main()` to `startGoRuntime()`\r\n3. Rename the executable to `myGoLib.o`\r\n4. Link your C program against that `.o` file\r\n5. Call `startGoRuntime()` from your C code (in a new thread) whenever you need to start the Go runtime (can only do this once obviously)\r\n\r\nThis method has limitations – for example, I'm pretty sure C code could never call into Go code from a non-Go thread.
