I run expsend on a machine named b01, and imprecv\non a machine named b02.  expsend has been altered to use port 2222, and imprecv\nhas been altered to use b01:2222 as the host to contact.  imprecv has also been altered\nto use unbounded rather the hard-coded 10 as number of msgs to travel on the \nchannel.\nFirst, I start expsend on b01 and then imprecv on b02.  I expect to see 10 messages \nreceived by imprecv, but only 9 are retrieved.  If I alter expsend to send one extra \ndummy/flush msg (commented out in the code), then the 10th integer arrives at \nimprecv.  \n\n(b02:98)% env | grep GO\nGOROOT=/sandbox/rbutler/go\nGOOS=linux\nGOARCH=amd64\nGOBIN=/sandbox/rbutler/go/bin\n\nPlease let me know if you require any additional info.\nThanks a bunch.\n--ralph\nrbutler@mcs.anl.gov\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/790/0/expsend.go\"\u003eexpsend.go\u003c/a\u003e (701 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/790/0/imprecv.go\"\u003eimprecv.go\u003c/a\u003e (1024 bytes)",
