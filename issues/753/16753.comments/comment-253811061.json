	"body": "Thanks Luigi.  All of the fragment IDs look good, with the following exception.\r\n\r\nI disagree with Dmitri about the need for links such as #File.io.Closer.  Despite their similar syntaxes, there's a crucial difference between embedding in structs and in interfaces.  In a struct, an embedded field `type T struct { pkg.X }` is both a use of a type pkg.X and a declaration of a field X, and it is the second of these two facts that warrants a fragment #T.X.  In contrast, an embedded interface `type I interface { pkg.X }` is still a use of the type pkg.X but it is not a declaration of anything; it doesn't introduce any new names.  I think Godoc should define URLs only for things that have names in Go.",
