	"body": "@appleby, @shurcooL thank you for the feedback, it was very helpful.\r\n\r\n\u003e In your example, the link to the package has been dropped\r\n\r\nThat's because I did not import all the requested packages in my source example. In this case the `io` package.\r\n\r\nIn this new [test](https://github.com/golang/go/files/491998/page.zip) page, a struct or interface like:\r\n```\r\ntype Nested struct {\r\n    Nest1, Nest2 struct {\r\n        X int\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwill have two bookmarks respectively for `Nest1` and `Nest2`:\r\n`Nested.Nest1`, `Nested.Nest2` ;\r\nand two bookmarks for `X`:\r\n`Nested.Nest1.X`, `Nested.Nest2.X`.\r\n\r\nWe limit the nesting up to 2 levels, as higher levels would be a very bad practice, thus the struct:\r\n```\r\ntype Nested struct {\r\n    Nest1, Nest2 struct {\r\n        Nest3, Nest4 struct {\r\n            X int\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwill only have bookmarks up to `Nest4`, excluding `X` because it has a nesting level of 3.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think or if you want to make any changes.\r\n",
