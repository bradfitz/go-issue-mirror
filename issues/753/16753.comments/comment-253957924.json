That rationale is very good.\r\n\r\n\u003e I disagree with Dmitri about the need for links such as #File.io.Closer.\r\n\r\nMy comment was not about the need for that link, it was about the need for `io` component _if_ that link were to be included. I think you have described in a good way why the whole thing should not be linked. That's an even better solution.",
