I have\npoured over the microsoft documentation and don't can't see anywhere that I am being\nunsafe.\n\nThanks,\nTarmigan\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1753/6/serial_windows.go\"\u003eserial_windows.go\u003c/a\u003e (6764 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1753/6/main.go\"\u003emain.go\u003c/a\u003e (1033 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1753/6/bug.exe\"\u003ebug.exe\u003c/a\u003e (972288 bytes)",
