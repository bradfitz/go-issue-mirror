Making the stdlib net package privileged in a way no other network package could ever be:\r\n- makes problems like this lack of `SO_REUSEPORT` for TCP/UDP harder to solve,\r\n- harms other networking libraries which may need to manipulate sockets at lower levels than `net` package interfaces allow, \r\n- harms implementations of other protocols (e.g. SCTP, uTP, QUIC),\r\n- and is not clean.\r\n\r\nThis is a separate issue altogether-- if you agree with the above claims, I can file another issue and expand on the problem.",
