The more verbose solution proposed above by @mikioh is fraught with peril, as there are many minutiae that needs to be attended and that vary greatly across platforms (how to set the FD non-blocking, close-on-exec, how to find a decent default backlog value to pass to `listen`, etc).\r\n\r\nI also went down a similar path as @jbenet and ended up replicating a simplified version of a bunch of code from the `net` package, but it's really not a tractable solution.\r\n\r\n+1 to the proposal of using function options to allow the user to set tunables.",
