	"body": "I tried to make a package called `documentation` today. Looks like `.go` files in any package called `documentation` are ignored. @aclements helped me do some sleuthing and discovered the original reason for a magic `documentation` package: \r\n\r\nhttps://codereview.appspot.com/7475048/patch/10001/11001\r\n\r\nThere is a [comment in `go/build`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/e28ff1f3a154285607ddde23a61005b648dcd0eb/src/go/build/build.go#L451) that mentions this behavior. However, `go help packages` does not include this behavior in its list of [reserved names](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/e28ff1f3a154285607ddde23a61005b648dcd0eb/src/cmd/go/help.go#L50).\r\n\r\nIt was unclear if this behavior is still desired (perhaps for backwards compatibility?), or if it should be removed. At the very least, seems like the documentation should be updated if this is still correct.",
