	"body": "I recently had an issue which made Go consume all ephemeral ports and start failing to do requests.\r\nThe problem was triggered because I was doing 10 concurrent requests with the DefaultMaxIdleConnsPerHost so Transport was only reusing 2 connections and closing the other 8 as soon as a request was finished, just to reestablish a connection again.\r\nThis seems a really bad behavior and never happened to me on any other language or http client.\r\nA connection is usually considered idle when it was not used for a period of inactivity, maybe a whole keepalive period or so, not after a request has been sent successfully.\r\nThe behavior one would expect is to have 10 established connections and, after say 30 seconds of not issuing any request having only 2 connections established as per DefaultMaxIdleConnsPerHost.\r\n\r\nHere is a [gist](https://gist.github.com/sschepens/062c7dbdf29272eea4af) that triggers this behavior.\r\n\r\nI'm running go 1.5.2 on Ubuntu Precise 12.04, kernel: Linux e-0000e768 3.8.0-44-generic #66~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 04:01:04 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux",
