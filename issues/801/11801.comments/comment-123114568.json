There were no hints that this might be a special case (and no documentation where the other special cases of go build are documented). The original intent of this rule was to let you put a \"package documentation\" source file alongside \"package main\" source files in a directory presumably called neither \"documentation\" or \"main\", so the user was clearly opting in to some special case.",
