It returns a []FileInfo for every name returned by\nReaddirnames, with a dummy entry for names for which Lstat failed. In the case of such a\nfailed Lstat, Readdir also returns the first such error, but it still returns the full\n[]FileInfo too.\n\nThe change from Go 1.1 is that Go 1.1 returned nil even if there was a failed Lstat. I\nwill reinstate that behavior.\u003c/pre\u003e",
