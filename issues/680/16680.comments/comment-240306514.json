(My coworker ran into it today as soon as he experimented with upgrading our project to 1.7.)\r\n\r\nIs the thought that everybody who has the old .o files is likely to discover the workaround before a 1.7.1 would be released anyway, and that future versions won't have this problem because the exporter format change won't happen again?",
