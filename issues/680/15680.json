	"body": "It appears that cmd/go assembles all asm files in a package serially; AFAIK they can always be assembled concurrently. The assembler is fast, but it's not so fast that it wouldn't help. For example, the math package's asm files take 300ms cumulatively on my machine, and there are enough of them (and the math package is enough of a central dependency) that the concurrency savings would be worthwhile. Something similar holds for the runtime package.",
