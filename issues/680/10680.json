But I suspect builders are CPU busy building Go and running tests - we are running both windows-386 and windows-amd64 in parallel. I added code similar to runtime/pprof/cpuHogger to TestAfterQueuing and I can make TestAfterQueuing fail on VM here (not on real hardware). I suggest we increase delta to 200 * Millisecond (It is 100 * Millisecond at this moment). That fixes my failure. It might make builders more reliable. How does that sound?\r\n\r\nAlex",
