	"body": "OpenBSD is still flaky too, even after bumping retries up to 100ms (#9903, d12b532).  It probably makes sense that for a second retry (i.e., third attempt) we can try an even longer delta period, like 500ms or a full second.  Since the tests are only occasionally flaky right now, an extra conservative delta duration shouldn't affect our average testing times much.\r\n\r\nOverall, the test as written is just inherently flaky.  There's no guarantee the `await` goroutines will execute in the desired order.  They might get scheduled across multiple CPUs or even just get scheduled out of order on a single CPU.\r\n\r\nAn alternative non-flaky way to write the test would be to `select` on all of the `time.After` channels (probably using `reflect.Select`) and make sure that if the runtime chooses to receive from `time.After(N*delta)` then we need to either have already received from all of the shorter duration timeouts or receiving from them now should not block.",
