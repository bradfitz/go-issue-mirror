However,\nI do see the parallel with input and output parameter lists, and I\nunderstand wanting to make receiver lists use the same grammar, so I'd\ngo along with this.\n\nSince we seem to be on a parenthesization kick, the errors about\nparenthesization in the gc compiler are:\n\nyyerror(\"cannot parenthesize type in composite literal\");\nyyerror(\"cannot parenthesize receiver type\");\nyyerror(\"cannot parenthesize embedded type\");\n\nI believe that the type in a composite literal and the embedded type\nin a struct definition are special enough that we should keep the\nrestrictions there.\u003c/pre\u003e",
