The whole reason we have the Go 1 compatibility promise (https://golang.org/doc/go1compat) is so there's no reason for people to not upgrade from Go 1.n to Go 1.n+1.  If something worked in Go 1.3 but doesn't work in Go 1.4, that's a bug and we'll fix it in Go 1.4 (in a point release) and at tip as well.  That promise takes much more time than \"six months\".  But what we're not going to do is go cherry-pick all fixes into all old releases of Go.",
