I plan to continue.\n\nAs far as guessing goes, I have 2 possibilities in mind.\n\n1) It could be variation of something we have seen before.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/4978047\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/4978047\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIf you look at hector comment:\n\n\" ... It is impossible to know when the binary has been unmapped from memory.\nWaiting on the process handle doesn't work because the handle gets signalled as\nsoon as ExitProcess() is called, and the binary will still be mapped at that\ntime. ...\"\n\nI could not find reference to that fact anywhere. But, perhaps, hector saw it happens\nwhile debugging program.\n\n2) Our *os.Process has Release function, that is NOP on unix, but closes process handle\non windows. Release function is set to be called by finallizer, and most of the time it\nis good enough. But os/exec.Command does not call Release explicitly, and relies on\nfinalizer to do it. Perhaps, we delete test binary, but process handle is still opened,\nbecause finalizer didn't run yet. Perhaps it is the cause.\n\nThese are not even theories, just hints. Perhaps, there is something else - something\nmuch simpler.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
