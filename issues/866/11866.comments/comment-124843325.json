Perhaps something like\r\n\r\n```cmd := exec.Command(\"bash\", \"-c\", \"echo hello \u003e /tmp/aaa\")```\r\n\r\nBe careful with this though. If you construct a string and pass it to a shell, you need to think carefully about escaping and security. For the particular example you give, you may want to consider using os.Open, os.Create, and io.Copy.",
