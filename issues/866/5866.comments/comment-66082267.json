I figured Windows support would be dicey.\n\nAt some point, I'll just take my code home from work and use my home machine (which, of\ncourse, runs a much more tolerable operating system :) ). Until then, I'll just have to\nkeep things going in my own private repository.\n\nI'm also not satisfied with the little endian \"hack\" I posted from above... it really\nseems like the binary package should be used, but it degrades performance drastically.\nThe profiling tools (another excellent bowl of fun to get working on Windows, by the\nway) showed a large amount of time in runtime.mallocgc, which I can't find any\ndocumentation on, but I assume is a garbage collection routine. I'll look into it more\ntomorrow.\u003c/pre\u003e",
