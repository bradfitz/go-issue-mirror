In this case, the parser\nguesses the label declaration to start at the x and reports it as such but does not\nreport the erroneous % (because it's considered a spurious error).\n\nChanged the label error reporting to use the '%' position instead. Now the first error\nreported is for the '%':\n\ngofmt test.go\ntest.go:4:7: expected operand, found '%'\ntest.go:5:2: expected '}', found 'EOF'\n\nAlso added a -e flag to gotype and gofmt to get all errors:\n\ngofmt -e test.go\ntest.go:4:7: expected operand, found '%'\ntest.go:4:8: expected ')', found 'IDENT' v\ntest.go:4:9: illegal label declaration\ntest.go:4:11: expected ';', found 'IDENT' hi\ntest.go:4:13: string not terminated\ntest.go:5:2: expected '}', found 'EOF'\ntest.go:5:2: expected ';', found 'EOF'\n\nThe scanner always checked for newlines in strings (again, in this specific case that\nerror is only reported with the -e flag set).\u003c/pre\u003e",
