One can work it out from the current documentation for String(), but I'm not sure it's going to be clear or obvious to people.\r\n\r\n(Specifically, I'm not sure I'd have realized that eg time.Time was not compatible from this documentation alone. But on the other hand, the Go documentation style tends towards terse.)",
