	"body": "@adonovan This seems reasonable. One question I have though: Why shouldn't go/types simply create a fake package if there's none, like we do for `import \"C\"`. It could also do that where the importer is not installed. Furthermore, w/o an API change, it's only go/types that can set the `fake` bit in a package at the moment.\r\n\r\nAn issue with go/types creating fake packages is that they won't be added to the importer-known list of packages - but since they are fake it shouldn't matter.\r\n\r\nComments?",
