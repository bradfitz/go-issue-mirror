	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.7\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\ndarwin/amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nBuild [this package](https://gist.github.com/joshlf/d07a72dd5de30cd2e326e072c8a8cd32) using `go build -tags build_source` with no binary version present.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nThe package should have built successfully since the `// +build !build_source` tag in `binary.go` should have excluded the `//go:binary-only-package` directive in that same file.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n`missing or invalid package binary for binary-only package ...`\r\n\r\n\r\n",
