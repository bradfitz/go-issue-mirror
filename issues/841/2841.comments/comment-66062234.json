The error text is \"Signature: need to call SignRSA or SignDSA before\nSerialize\", but \"SignRSA\" and \"SignDSA\" do not exist anywhere else in the source tree.\nThey appear to have been rolled into (*Signature).Sign. So error and godoc comment\nshould probably be changed to reflect this: error \"Signature: need to call Sign, SignKey\nor SignUserId before Serialize\", comment \"Sign, SignKey or SignUserId must have been\ncalled first. \"\n\nShould openpgp/errors.unknownIssuerError return \"signature made by unknown entity\"\nrather than \"signature make by unknown entity\"?\u003c/pre\u003e",
