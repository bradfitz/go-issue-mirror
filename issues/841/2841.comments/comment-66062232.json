So\nVerificationError means that the signature is bust, which might be useful to distinguish\nfrom \"I/O error from the random source\" and \"we don't support this hash function\", which\nare other errors that can come from signature verification.\n\nI don't care much either way however if you want to flatten them.\n\nSetWriteDeadline seemed like a longer change so I left that for a different CL.\u003c/pre\u003e",
