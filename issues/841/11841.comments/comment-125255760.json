But there are clearly things that are not right about the handling of name spaces, and it would be good to fix those, provided we can figure out what the right behaviors are. My concern for Go 1.5 is that I don't believe we actually know those answers, and the release is upon us. I do want to try to understand name space behavior better for the next cycle and try to make a fix. I hope that a long term fork only for more sensible name space behavior is not necessary.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit extreme to call waiting for Go 1.6 \"tragic\". No other packages in the standard library force the use of encoding/xml (unlike, say, net or net/url), so it is trivial for people who need different behavior to use an internal copy of encoding/xml in the interim. @rogpeppe even noted that for Ubuntu they can't assume Go 1.5 so they have to use a copy anyway. Webdav can do the same (x/net/webdav/internal/xml). If you're willing to depend on the vendor experiment you can use your/code/vendor/encoding/xml and not even have to change your import paths.\r\n\r\nI would prefer not to see a golang.org/x/exp/xml. I'd rather people make forks with the changes _they_ need instead of trying to have a fork that's all things to all people. \r\n\r\nAgain, fixing xml name spaces is on my short list for Go 1.6.\r\n",
