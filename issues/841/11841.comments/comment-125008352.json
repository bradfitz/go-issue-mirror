We do not want people building tooling around an official package that is broken and then having them say, \"well Go must not be that stable or not very good because this official core package is broken and no one has fixed it.\".  Having been in software development for a very long time I would argue that breaking changes in minor release are justified and okay, when the original intent of the package does not work and some how made it through QA.\r\n\r\nWhat I am saying is, if we were to survey the community, and ask them..... \"Do you want the main repo fixed, even if it requires breaking changes, or do you want a new parallel package that may never get merged back in to the main repo\"?  My guess is the vast majority would just say, \"Fix the main repo\". ",
