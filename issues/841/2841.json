Let's add Reset() to the\ncipher.Block interface and then these all get much shorter: aes.NewCipher\nreturns (cipher.Block, error) instead of its own type, just like we do for\nthe hash functions.  That also has the benefit of pointing people toward\nthe crypto/cipher package, which they should be using anyway.\nThe warning about not inadvertently inventing ECB mode can go in one\nplace, on the cipher.Block interface doc comment.\n\ncrypto/cipher: NewCBCDecrypter says 'as must', should be 'and must'.\n\ncrypto/cipher: move the OCFB modes into go.crypto/openpgp?\nThey seem out of place here and I assume they are not using\ninternals of package cipher.\n\ncrypto/des: the doc comments on Encrypt, Decrypt should begin with\nthose words.\n\ncrypto/dsa: ErrInvalidPublicKey can use errors.New instead of a\ncustom type.\n\ncrypto/rsa: DecryptionError, MessageTooLongError, VerificationError\nare not interesting as types (they are intentionally vague).\nCan replace with ErrDecrypt = errors.New(\u0026quot;decryption failed\u0026quot;) etc.\n\ncrypto/rsa: DecryptOAEP: s/random/rand/ to match doc comment\nand other functions.\n\ncrypto/rsa: DecryptPKCS1v15SessionKey's doc comment ends abruptly,\nafter a comma.\n\ncrypto/tls: Conn should implement SetWriteDeadline.  Any write failure\ncan be sticky (all future writes fail), but otherwise there's no way to\ntime out.\n\ncrypto/tls: unclear whether *Listener type is needed.  Could rename to\nlistener (unexported) and make the Listen and NewListener functions\nreturn net.Listener.\n\ncrypto/x509/pkix: missing doc for AttrTypeAndValue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
