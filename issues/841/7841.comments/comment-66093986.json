A\nrace that went undetected by the race detector. The fact that its worked for so long\nunder Go1.2 is probably luck.\n\nI've been going field by field through the struct that was being serialized and I ran\nacross some code that looks something like this:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/MosS_UQQLm\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/MosS_UQQLm\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe code was attempting lazy loading of the Images by returning the *Image and then\nsetting the fields inside another goroutine, relying on the channel send/recv to\nsynchronize. I don't think that is safe. As soon as I removed this lazy loading, the\ncrash went away.\n\nApologies for wasting so much of your time. Perhaps this can become a feature request\nand test case for the race detector.\u003c/pre\u003e",
