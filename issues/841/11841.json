	"title": "encoding/xml: restore Go 1.4 name space behavior",
	"body": "There have been changes to the name space behavior in encoding/xml in this cycle. Those changes affect the output of existing programs, possibly breaking them. (I know of at least one real case.) And yet it's still not clear that the name space story is complete. Is it right to make breaking changes at all? Will we make more breaking changes in Go 1.6 to complete or extend the story? Should we make all the breaking changes at once? Should we arrange that you have to opt in to the breaking changes? Should we declare encoding/xml done, like syscall, and require people who want different behavior to use forks?\n\nAll this needs to be more carefully considered, and there is not time left for that in the Go 1.5 cycle.\n\nI propose to rewind the name space behavior back to what we had in Go 1.4 and then look at this all very carefully in the Go 1.6 cycle.\n\n@rogpeppe @nigeltao",
