Also,\nreadline provides e.g. cleanup functions I can call to process SIGINT correctly, in\nparticular to restore the terminal attributes.\n\nIt might take a bit more work to have the readline() call return to the caller in Go\n(while in C doing fclose(stdin) is enough).\n\nAlso, from the perspective of a readline binding package, it would be nice to emulate\nthe default readline behavior of catching SIGINT, doing the cleanup and resending the\nsignal. However this would require support from the os/signal package to temporarily\nremove existing SIGINT handlers (with the current API one can only add a handler, which\nresults in a race condition if another SIGINT handler calls os.Exit() before cleanup is\ndone).\u003c/pre\u003e",
