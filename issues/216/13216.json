	"body": "Mark.Twain-Tom.Sawyer.txt under compress/testdata is licensed under non-free license \"Project Gutenberg license\". As book itself is in Public Domain I'm proposing to remove the current non-free license from the file including all references to \"Project Gutenberg\" .\r\n\r\nThis issue affects all branches of golang source tree including this file. And think it should be fixed in all supported release.\r\n\r\nIf this change is acceptable/accepted, I will provide patch for review in gerrit.",
