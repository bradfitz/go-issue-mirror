At the time, I didn't have permission from Twitter legal to post it, but they have since given me permission.  I don't recall what state this was in -- that is, what parts of it worked, what testing was done, etc.  Sorry for the poor record-keeping here.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's a starting point.  If you need any assignments or signatures in order to use this, I am happy to execute them. ",
