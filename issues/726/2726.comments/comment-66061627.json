The absolute differences are BBC 7 bytes, CNN 77 bytes, Wikipedia -23 bytes,\nBible 729 bytes.  Given that for the the Linux gzip files the gzip header has the\nfilename in it this is a very, very satisfactory result.  Marvellous!\n\nFor completeness here are the percentages\n\nBBC 99.97%\nCNN 99.61%\nWikipedia 100.15%\nKing James Bible 99.95%\n\nGiven how close this is (and often better), I'm satisfied.  Thanks for working on this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
