The issue is with binary releases,\nwhich don't exist for 1.2 (yet) or tip (probably ever).\n\nAttempting to build a binary release myself (using misc/dist/bindist.go) doesn't produce\na binary build that fails at either 1.1.2, or tip. Only the build downloadable from\ngolang.org doesn't work.\n\nIt may be the case that:\n a. The machine creating the binary package is doing something to cause the problem.\n b. Differences in the environment/toolchain between the build machine and my own (and others) is causing the problem\n\nIf it was possible to get my hands on a binary build of tip or a 1.2 release candidate\nbuilt by the \"official\" release machine (if one exists...) then I could tell you if the\nsituation still exists for me, otherwise we have to wait until after Go 1.2 is released\nto see if the problem persists.\u003c/pre\u003e",
