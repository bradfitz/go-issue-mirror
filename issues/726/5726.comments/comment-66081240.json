That in turns affects the generated file\ncmd/go/zdefaultcc.go which is then used to determine the program to run when building a\npackage that uses cgo or SWIG.  So if we build on OS X 10.7, we will get a go tool that\ninvokes gcc for cgo programs, but if we build on OS X 10.8 we will get a go tool that\ninvokes clang for cgo programs.  How much of a difference this makes I do not know.\u003c/pre\u003e",
