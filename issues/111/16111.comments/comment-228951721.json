In 2011 or so, a CL that was meant to be a Windows-only bug fix inadvertently (it was not documented) introduced the behavior of `filepath.Clean` replacing `/` with `filepath.Separator`.\r\n2. It went unnoticed and undocumented for 4 years until 2015, when @hyangah ran into the issue and opened #10122. It was resolved by documenting the actual behavior rather than trying to undo the unintended behavior change... because no one noticed for 4 years.\r\n3. One year later, I ran into this and didn't see the documentation fix from https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/7310/ until Hana pointed it out to me. When I did find the docs, I wasn't happy with their visibility and opened this issue.\r\n\r\nSo, that kinda explains why we're in this situation right now, where the behavior is odd and documentation is not very accurate or precise.",
