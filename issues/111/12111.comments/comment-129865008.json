This restriction is present for a good reason. It prevents importing paths in two different ways and keeps things a bit saner.\r\n\r\nTrust me on this. Import path rewriting should never be done into a vendor folder with this GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT on. For the sake of consistency and ecosystem we shouldn't vendor at all by doing import path rewriting.
