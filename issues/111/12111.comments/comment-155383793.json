I now had to sit and think for five minutes to understand why I didn't understand at the time. \r\n\r\nI think the core problem is that it doesn't explain *why*. It says what is wrong, but it is unclear why it's a problem or how to fix it. At the time searching for the error message was not illuminating either. From a quick search now, just the existence of this issue and the thread on -nuts probably improve someones chances at discovering and understanding what is wrong.",
