Import path rewriting works great with vendoring, if they are re-written to a folder like internal. I would still advise against it because most tools won't support a way to de-duplicate packages then.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kardianos/govendor plays just fine with imports re-written to the internal directory.\r\n",
