Literal IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are not permitted in \"HostName\"». I take that to mean a dotted-quad ASCII string isn't allowed, perhaps to avoid the ambiguity of it and the destination IP address differing. The alternative is it means a 32-bit IPv4 address cannot be given, but that's already ruled out by \"ASCII encoding\".\r\n\r\nA tls.Dial(\"tcp\", \"3.1.4.1:5\", ...) passes \"3.1.4.1\" in the TLS's ClientHello.",
