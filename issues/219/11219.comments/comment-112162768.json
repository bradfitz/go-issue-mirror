It should return nil when the Listener is Closed (for whatever Closed means; it doesn't matter, as you pointed out).\r\n\r\nI can understand why this might be frozen, since lots of existing code assumes Serve (and ListenAndServe) never returns nil, although arguably that's not the language's (and thus Go 1's) problem, since an error can always be nil. I suppose a new Server.ServeBetter is out of the question? :)",
