	"body": "It's more complicated than making one byte uppercase for the reasons explained earlier. And anything once exported has to be maintained and has to have its semantics locked-in. Which means we have to know what those semantics are, they need to be documented, they need to be tested, etc. Currently the return values of `net.Listener.Close` are undefined, as they always have been.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this is a documentation bug about `net/http`. Feel free to open a new bug or use the [proposal process](https://golang.org/s/proposal-process) if you want to see `net.Listener` changed.",
