I do not know if Windows guarantees to report the removal of the file\nbefore the removal of the directory containing it, but that is what the test\nexpects.\n\nThe net error could be induced by the usableLocalPort function added at:\n\nchangeset:   12889:e28f1aac1223\nuser:        Mikio Hara \u0026lt;mikioh.mikioh@gmail.com\u0026gt;\ndate:        Tue Mar 06 00:13:10 2012 +0900\nsummary:     net: make Dial and Listen behavior consistent across over platforms\n\nIt could be that the socket is really not being closed, or that again there is a race\nbetween l.Close happening and the the socket being used in the test.\n\nThe net/http failure could be a bug in Windows networking.  Perhaps closing\nthe connection on the server side does not wait for the sent data to be received,\nso that ReadResponse does not actually receive the header it expects.\n\nBut all three of these failures appeared simultaneously, and only the net test\nhas been edited recently.  I think that maybe the tests are buggy _and_ the\nbugs only appear when run on a particularly loaded system.  \n\nDoes this happen every time you run all.bat or just occasionally?  Can you make\nit happen again at all?\n\nIf it is not 100% reproducible then I am inclined to push it to after Go 1.\nI am running Windows 7 x64 under VMware without problems.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-go1**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to **builder@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
