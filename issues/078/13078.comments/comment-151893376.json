Personal motivation: Camlistore's Git repo is huge, but mostly because we used to have some huge assets and other libraries in it, since gone. But that means for a user just wanting a few files, they have to download megabytes.\r\n\r\nPeople who want history can go into the git directories and run the git commands.\r\n\r\nOr we can add a new `-full` or `-deep` flag to `go get`.",
