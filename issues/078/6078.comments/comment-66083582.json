Your program hi.go is importing \"cglib\" but that package has\ndeclared some other name for itself (not cglib), which is why you\nsee both `imported and not used: \"cglib\"` and `undefined: cglib`\nwhen you try to use it.\n\nI fixed this yesterday. The first error will now say\n\t./hi.go:4: imported and not used: \"cglib\" as pkgname\nwhere pkgname is whatever cglib has declared itself to be.\n\n2. If you are in a directory with only cgo files but cgo is disabled,\n'go install .' fails to print an error (it does nothing).\n\nI will make this bug about #2.\u003c/pre\u003e",
