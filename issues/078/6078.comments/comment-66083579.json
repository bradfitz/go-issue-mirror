The mylib library in turn links to a my own 32-bit C library\n3. GOHOSTARCH is amd64\n4. Install mylib with GOARCH=386 and CGO_ENABLED=1\n5. If GOARCH is set to 386 (with default CGO_ENABLED value which is 0) -\u003e happens if one\nuses another shell or logins in after few days and unsuspectingly just sets GOARCH\n\n\nNow trying to build hi.go gives errors as above.\u003c/pre\u003e",
