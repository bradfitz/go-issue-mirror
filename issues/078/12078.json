	"body": "Hi.\r\n\r\nFollowing the discussion at [net/http: add method constants from RFC 2616](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/sRg3-VTaGCo/discussion) and [net/http: HTTP methods check](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-dev/sxdSL1_Jbaw/discussion).\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n*go version 1.4.2 linux/amd64*\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?\r\n*Archlinux 4.1.4-1-ck #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Aug 3 16:56:11 EDT 2015 x86_64 GNU/Linux*\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n*`req, err := http.NewRequest(\"GET \", url, nil)`, notice the extra space.*\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n*An error as it is not a valid HTTP method.*\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n*For [https://golang.org](https://golang.org), the proper response for a GET request is send but it is inconsistent between servers. For instance, if we use \" GET\", some servers will respond with a bad request status.*\r\n\r\nIt would also be useful to add the commonly used method constants to net/http from [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3) along with PATCH from [RFC 5789](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789):\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/net/http/methods.go b/src/net/http/methods.go\r\nnew file mode 100644\r\nindex 0000000..3e8b18c\r\n--- /dev/null\r\n+++ b/src/net/http/methods.go\r\n@@ -0,0 +1,21 @@\r\n+// Copyright 2015 The Go Authors.
