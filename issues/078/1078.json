	"body": "\u003cpre\u003efrom golang-nuts:\n\nHello,\n\nSorry that I made you loose your time, I've found the problem, I was\nsetting SetTimeout wrong, so it always returned because the timeout\nwas very short. Maybe the error could be clearer, something like a\n\u0026quot;read timeout\u0026quot; could be much more useful than this.\n\nThanks anyway, and sorry again.\n\n2010/9/3 Roger Pau Monn=C3=A9 \u0026lt;royger@gmail.com\u0026gt;:\n\u0026gt; I've just pushed a new version, that saves a log of every session with\n\u0026gt; every peer, create a \u0026quot;logs\u0026quot; folder inside \u0026quot;wgo\u0026quot; folder, and run\nit.
