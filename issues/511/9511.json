	"body": "As discussed in #9495, it might be time to end our support for OS X 10.6.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to find Apple's policy on supporting older versions of OS X, but it appears they haven't published anything publicly. (Which seems outrageous to me, but whatever.)\r\n\r\nThe major concern, I believe, is that OS X 10.6 is the newest version of OS X that runs on pre-EFI macs (or something?). I think @robpike actually has one of these old machines.",
