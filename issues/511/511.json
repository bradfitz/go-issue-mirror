	"body": "\u003cpre\u003ebufio.ReadString is a useful tool for parsing data. However, right now it\nonly supports reading up until a byte, which is constraining. It would be\nawesome if it could read data until a string is reached. \n\nWhen I wrote a small template library for go, I couldn't use bufio.Reader\nbecause of this, and I had to implement my own readString method. \n\n(see \u003ca href=\"http://github.com/hoisie/gostache/blob/master/gostache.go)\"\u003ehttp://github.com/hoisie/gostache/blob/master/gostache.go)\u003c/a\u003e \n\nI'm facing this problem again, so I thought I'd write an issue about it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
