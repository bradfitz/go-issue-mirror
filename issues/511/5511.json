Have a small command line go program spread over two+ files in a folder.\n2. Execute 'go run' in the folder.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nIt should compile \u0026amp; run all non-test go-files in the folder, as described in 'go\nhelp run'\n\nOther go commands (build, vet, fmt \u0026amp;c) works like this on these source files, so I\nwould expect 'go run' to do the same.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nError message 'go run: no go files listed'\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nOS X (most recent version as per May 2013)\n\nWhich version are you using?
