(Which seems outrageous to me, but whatever.)\r\n\r\nFrom [this link](https://security.berkeley.edu/content/my-mac-os-x-operating-system-supported):\r\n\r\n```\r\nIs my Mac OS X operating system supported?\r\nQ. Where can I find information about operating systems supported by Apple?\r\n\r\nA. Generally Apple does not officially acknowledge the end of support for Mac OS X\r\noperating systems. Historically, Appleâ€™s support has been limited to 2-3 recent\r\noperating system releases. When Apple releases security updates for Mac OS,\r\noperating systems with vulnerabilities that are no patched by Apple should be\r\nconsidered unsupported and out of compliance with the Mininum Security\r\nStandards for Network Devices (MSSND).\r\n\r\nThe current list of supported Mac OS X operating systems (as of 2014-10-30):\r\n\r\nOS X 10.8 \"Mountain Lion\"\r\nOS X 10.9 \"Mavericks\"\r\nOS X 10.10 \"Yosemite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd say it's pragmatic to drop the N-5 version.
