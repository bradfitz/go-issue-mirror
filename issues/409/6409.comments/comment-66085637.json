I'm writing an application that uses\nchained calls with maps and funcs passed into them, and gofmt breaks their indentation. \nChained calls themselves might be uncommon, but they can be justified, and in those\ncases the code should still be readable.  I hope the Go team agrees!\u003c/pre\u003e",
