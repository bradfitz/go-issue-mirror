What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nMac OS 10.11.4, darwin amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nI installed 1.7rc2 from the pkg build (go1.7rc2.darwin-amd64.pkg).  I had set GOROOT to a different directory, but it always installs to /usr/local/go.  \r\n\r\nThe documentation earlier, if I remember right, had a way to install to a different directory but even that is not there.\r\n\r\nIs there no way to install it to a different directory?\r\n\r\n",
