	"title": "runtime: improve documentation on SetFinalizer",
	"body": "\r\nThe documentation for [SetFinalizer](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/runtime/#SetFinalizer) uses named variables `obj` and `finalizer` in the method signature, but refers to `x` and `f` in the documentation comment.  This makes it harder to read, since the doc refers to hypothetical variables rather than the ones used by the function.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, later down in the comment `obj`:\r\n\r\n    It is not guaranteed that a finalizer will run if the size of *obj is zero bytes.\r\n\r\nI believe this already tricky method would be easier to understand if the doc used consistent terminology.",
