It's the time\npackage's Format function (.Date is a time.Time object).  I used the template example as\nthat was how I was calling it.\n\nPerhaps I should have gone with:\nfmt.Println(time.Date(2014,6,10,0,0,0,0,time.Local).Format(\"Monday 2nd January 2006\"))\n\nIn terms of language conventions, the package does support days of the week, etc.\u003c/pre\u003e",
