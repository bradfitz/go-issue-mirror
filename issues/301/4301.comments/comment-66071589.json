It's the styling of the body element itself\nthat's causing the jitters.\n\nin doc/style.css:537 change the 'position' property of div#page.wide to be 'relative'\nand not 'fixed'. Tested it locally with Mobile Safari on iOS 6 (tablet and phone) and it\nscrolls smooth.\n\nIn terms of zooming on the phone, there's a bit more CSS to that in order to make it\nlook nice, but this solves the major pain-point.\u003c/pre\u003e",
