	"body": "Like I said, I never claimed my counter proposal was good. It was just to show that you don't need language changes. Similarly, you could go a step further and replace your just-proposed make flag with a runtime call too:\r\n\r\n```go\r\npackage runtime\r\n\r\nfunc SetFutureMode(ch interface{}) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut yes, it panics at runtime if you pass in a non-channel to it.\r\n\r\nWe've gone this long without futures, though, so I don't think it's worthwhile to add them in a hacky way, and it doesn't seem worth changing the language for them either.\r\n\r\nI'd rather wait for a \"Go 2\" and clean up a bunch of stuff, considering it all at the same time, rather than misc ad-hoc changes like this one.\r\n",
