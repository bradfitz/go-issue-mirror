Let's not ruin Go, please.\r\n\r\nAs for the case with \"many receivers may wait for a same value from a future\", use a RWMutex and release the W lock when the value is ready. Or cancel a context and store the result in a Value. Or maybe something in one of the many concurrency talks the Go team have made; I'm sure there's something somewhere.",
