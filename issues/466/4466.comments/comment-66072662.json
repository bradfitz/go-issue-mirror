I looked through the diffs,\nand the only addition is the new EOD marker, and I don't see how that would affect this\nunless it is mistakenly causing us to throw away profiles. But I can't see that it's\ndoing that.\n\nCan you please confirm that it still works at 1.0.2 in your VM? If so, can you please\ntry running the test for both of these versions:\n\nhg update -r 29990fa0951c\nhg update -r 92e962e13197\n\nIf it works in the first but fails in the second then we have a problem.\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **go1.1maybe**, removed **priority-triage**, **go1.1**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
