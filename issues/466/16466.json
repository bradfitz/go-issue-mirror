	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.6.2\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nWindows amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nGo doesn't provide Set type. I need create  the Set type via map which looks very ugly.\r\nBesides, I have to implement the functions by self.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nHave one builtin type Set and some more builtin functions like put, intersection and difference\r\n\r\n\r\n",
