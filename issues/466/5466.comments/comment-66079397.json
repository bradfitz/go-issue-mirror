Ran the tests and it did not\ncrash, but I got 3 timeouts:\n\n*** Test killed: ran too long (10m0s).\nFAIL\tarchive/zip\t600.019s\n\n*** Test killed: ran too long (10m0s).\nFAIL\tcrypto/dsa\t600.005s\n\n*** Test killed: ran too long (10m0s).\nFAIL\tmath/big\t600.006s\n\nConsidering the crashes I was seeing seemed to be related to semaphores, could these\ntimeouts be a deadlock that may have the same root cause of the crashes?\u003c/pre\u003e",
