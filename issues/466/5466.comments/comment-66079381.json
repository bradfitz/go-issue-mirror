If you cd to that package, run go test -c, then run the resulting\n$PKG.test binary you should seen an identical crash, as well as be able to use gdb to\ndissect the instruction.\n\nAs you go binary appears to be working, could you also include the output of `go env`\nwhen replying.\u003c/pre\u003e",
