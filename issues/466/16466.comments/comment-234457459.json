If it was a large set I'd write a tiny function to convert, say, a comma-separated string into the map.\r\n\r\nThe ability exists and is not difficult, it is just a little clumsy. The original proposal says it's ugly, so it sounds like it's really about syntactic sugar. Go isn't a particularly sweet language by nature, so this seems out of character.\r\n\r\nIf there are excellent implementation reasons for providing a builtin set type, they have not been argued.",
