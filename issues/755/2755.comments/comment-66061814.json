It would be truly surprising\nif adding :443 made it mean the host instead of the path.However, it\nmight be okay to treat something that has a dot before the first\ncolon as scheme-free, so that it was treated as a Path instead of\nas a syntax error.  That would fix CONNECT and be consistent\nwith the colon-free behavior.\u003c/pre\u003e",
