In some circumstances it\nwould be nice to have incomplete URLs like this work. But I had forgotten about relative\nURLs.\n\nIt is impossible to have one function that would correctly process relative URLs and\nalso have the do-what-I-mean capabilities users expect in the address bar. So there's\nreally no point moving the URL parser in the DWIM direction. If someone wants DWIM URL\nprocessing, they can parse the URL and then if that doesn't give them the result they\nwant, they can prefix \"http://\" and try again.\n\nSo it's probably best to just treat CONNECT as a special case.\u003c/pre\u003e",
