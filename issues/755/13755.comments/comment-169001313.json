Open your [`vendor/github.com/garyburd/redigo/internal` directory](https://github.com/ruseinov/gofail/tree/master/vendor/github.com/garyburd/redigo/internal) and compare it to the original [`internal` directory](https://github.com/garyburd/redigo/tree/master/internal) of the **redigo** repo. Something is missing, right?\r\n\r\nApparently, that is a bug of **govendor** that you've used (it didn't copy all files it had to). Try to install `go get -u github.com/FiloSottile/gvt` and start `gvt fetch github.com/garyburd/redigo` from your `$GOPATH/src/github.com/ruseinov/gofail`. Then start `go test ./...` again. It should work as expected.",
