	"body": "So basically the problem is as follows: if you have any package vendored that has a sub-package \"internal\" compiling/running/testing result in an error, that states that package name \"internal\" could not be used. That breaks compatibility with the libraries that have such a package-name.\r\n\r\nAn example of such library would be https://github.com/garyburd/redigo .\r\n\r\nThe go version is 1.5.2.",
