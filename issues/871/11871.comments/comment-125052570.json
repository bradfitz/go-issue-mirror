Consider this language in the docs:\r\n\r\n\u003e  Top-level functions, such as Float64 and Int, use a default shared Source that produces a deterministic sequence of values each time a program is run. Use the Seed function to initialize the default Source if different behavior is required for each run.\r\n\r\nGiven the discussion in #8013, the emerging consensus seemed to be that it would be okay to change the deterministic sequence to a different deterministic sequence if necessary (it ended up not being necessary), but any more than that, such as random seeding, seems well outside the compatibility promise.",
