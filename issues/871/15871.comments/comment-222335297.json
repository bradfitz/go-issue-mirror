Maybe, if possible, for those who do not care about the actual capacity hint, define a constant `DEFAULT_CAP` or something along that lines to hint that it should use the default. So, it'd become `make(map[string]int, DEFAULT_CAP, CONCURRENT)`.\r\n\r\nAre there any other arguments as well that can supplied to it? I've never actually seen anyone use a capacity hint for map, but it makes sense that there is one.",
