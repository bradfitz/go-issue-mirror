That could\nindeed be handled by a +build tag, but it could also be handled just\nby not using \"int\" in the Go -\u003e asm interface. Unless people write the\npublic interface in asm, in which case they could write a trivial Go\nfunc that calls an unexported asm, casting to int64.\u003c/pre\u003e",
