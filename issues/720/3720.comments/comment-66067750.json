From gets\nstored in the directory of the zip file. In my example code, it is f.Name. When a file\nis a symlink, the right flag is set in FileInfo().Mode(), see example. When that bit is\nset, the data stored in the zipfile where the file's contents would normally be stored\nis the \"to\" name for the symlink (what I called the target). You get it by calling\nf.Open() on it and the calling something like ioutil.ReadAll on the io.Reader you get\nback from Open().\u003c/pre\u003e",
