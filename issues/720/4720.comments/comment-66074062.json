Is premature\noptimization a problem? Yes, but for my services, stop-the-world GC pauses\nare worse, and I can't profile ahead of time for every combination of real\nworld scenarios.  The obvious places that need a pool will get them\nregardless.\n\nPlease reconsider.  A naive sync.Pool helps me get products to production\nfaster.  A GC-aware sync.Pool would be a godsend.\u003c/pre\u003e",
