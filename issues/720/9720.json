	"body": "@dvyukov might also want to discuss how best to align the update\r\nof the race runtime with our release cycle.\r\n\r\nPersonally I don't mind updating the race runtime more often, once\r\nsome user visible bugs are fixed. Now that we have gomote, building\r\nthe race runtime on all supported platforms shouldn't be a problem.\r\n(Ask bradfitz about gomote. I think at least Linux and FreeBSD are\r\ncovered.)",
