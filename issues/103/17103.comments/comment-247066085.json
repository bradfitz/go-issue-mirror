You can verify with `go list -json your/package/main/path`\r\n\r\nIn Go 1.6, methods aren't stripped by the linker, so any reference to httptest.Server in your program will cause that key to be included.\r\n\r\nIn Go 1.7, that symbol with the private key will be stripped if you never call httptest.Server.StartTLS.\r\n\r\nI verified this is all true and reproduced this with Go 1.6 and Go 1.7, verifying with `go tool nm` on the 6 binaries with different combinations of importing httptest.",
