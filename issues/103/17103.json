(main issue)\r\n- Why is test code getting into binary . (Side issue)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Is there a way to avoid the issue and not use package internal , so that bug is avoided.\r\n@adg \r\n@bradfitz \r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nNo keys in the binary. \r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\nPrivate / Key Cert in binary. \r\n\r\n",
