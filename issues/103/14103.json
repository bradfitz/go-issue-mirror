	"body": "I was trying to use the http.TimeFormat to format a http response and the way I found to do that is using:\r\ntime.Now().UTC().Format(http.TimeFormat) \r\nwhich uses the format ...\r\nconst TimeFormat = \"Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 GMT\"\r\n\r\nBut it's just using the format to output a string with a GMT in it.\r\nI have seen that everywhere in the golang code it's being used with a UTC() time conversion and I think that it is worth to mention that it *uses* the local time but just adds a GMT to it unless the time is being converted to UTC using the UTC() function.\r\nI encountered this issue more then once in the last couple month and I have not found anything actually mentioning it that you need to use UTC() with it in the docs.(which can confuse).\r\nCan a small addition to the http.TimeFormat  constant documentation be added??",
