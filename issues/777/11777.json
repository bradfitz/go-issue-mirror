	"body": "Currently Go does not provide a utility to compare efficiently a byte slice against a string. Doing `string(byteSlice) == str` is inefficient as it copies the slice first into a new string. It would be nice to have a utility like `bytes.EqualString(b []byte, s string)` that is just as efficient as `bytes.Equal(a, b []byte)`. Another alternative is to optimize `string(byteSlice) compareOp str` so compareOp accesses the slice directly. The latter would benefit the existing code even if it is harder to implement.\r\n\r\n",
