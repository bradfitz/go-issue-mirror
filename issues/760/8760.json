	"body": "by **smith.winston.101**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eGo version 1.3.1.\n\nThe syscall package includes a number of constants from termios.h to allow for terminal\nhandling without needing to use cgo.  For example, see the definitions syscall.CLOCAL\net. al. from types_linux.go (interestingly, some of these definitions for other UNIXes\ncan be found in zerrors_*_*.go files).\n\nHowever, the CRTSCTS flag is missing.  It's definition (from linux/termios.h) is a\nfollows:\n\n# define CRTSCTS  020000000000\n\nThis flag is used in the struct termios.c_cflag to indicate that RTS/CTS flow control\nshould be used.  While it's not part of POSIX, it's present on Linux, Mac OS X, BSD.\n\nWithout this definition in the syscall package, hardware flow control can only be enable\nvia CGO which prohibits cross compilation (unless the constant is hardcoded!).\n\nNOTE: There are a number of other termios related functions such as cfmakeraw() and\nisatty() that are also missing from the syscall package.\u003c/pre\u003e",
