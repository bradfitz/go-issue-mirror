I thought you were only referring to the default\noutput filename.\n\nHowever, the CL description hints at my plan for addressing that issue: either something\nthat looks like the +build notation, that go tool would understand to pass flags to\nyacc, or copying GNU bison for it's %option syntax and implementing that directly in\nyacc.go.\n\nI consider this orthogonal because it's a surmountable technical detail that doesn't\nexist if the discussion ends up rejecting my suggestion.\u003c/pre\u003e",
