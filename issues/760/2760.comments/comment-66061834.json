This means you need to remember to make prepare when you change\nthese \"original\" inputs, but you'll usually know when you're doing this kind of thing so\nyou can do:\n\nmake prepare all\n\n(all calls the go tool). Or if the prepare step is fast enough, you can always do it\nbefore having the Makefile run go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
