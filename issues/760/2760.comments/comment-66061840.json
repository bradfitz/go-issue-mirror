It could be made more robust to a\nmissing binary just as go tool does for other tools it knows about, in cmd/go/tool.go:56\n, were one to think that code generation should be something that go tool ought to\nsupport.\n\nNote that this change doesn't cause the *go* build to only sometimes work, though.\n\nBut (or, regardless) perhaps cmd/yacc should be moved to the go.tools repository instead.\n\nTo a newcomer (as I was when I filed this bug) it seemed that having the tool here\nimplied one should be able to rely on it during the build process.  If the go tool is\nnever going to support code generators, then it seems misleading to leave it in the\nprimary repo.\u003c/pre\u003e",
