	"body": "With current master, when I perform `GOBIN=\"$(pwd)\" go install`, no resulting binary is created. This seems to be a regression from go-1.4.2, specifically as a result of 227fb11.\r\n\r\nI use `GOBIN=\"$(pwd)\" go install` instead of `go build` as `go build` does not update the build cache (`$GOPATH/pkg`). Thus for development, and frequent builds, `go install` is much faster.\r\n\r\nSee also #9645 ",
