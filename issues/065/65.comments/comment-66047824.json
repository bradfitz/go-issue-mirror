I agree that it should be resolved, but I \nthink that leaving it the way it is may help everyone get into the habit of coding \n\nfunc example(x int) int {\n    if x == 0 {\n        return 5;\n    }\n    return x;\n}\n\nas opposed to\n\nfunc example(x int) int {\n    if x == 0 {\n        return 5;\n    } else {\n        return x;\n    }\n}\n\nI personally think the first one is cleaner and more elegant.\u003c/pre\u003e",
