In toy examples this is not of much concern, but if this were a\nbig function, that the if statement returns before the rest of the body would be less\nthan obvious. Some poor maintainer reading this elegant code will have to check\neverything in the if statement, when it would be better if they could just forget it\nand fix what needs to be fixed.\n\nI hope #4 has been noticed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
