Especially the part regarding cgo was very\ninsightful.\n\nJust for clarification, I didn't mean to say that Go and SWIG should move forward in\nlockstop. All I wanted to say is that 'go build' should fail with a good error message\nin case a too old Go version is in use. ;-)\n\nShould I open a bug regarding exporting and checking the Go version number?\u003c/pre\u003e",
