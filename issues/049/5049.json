	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe new mheap allocation takes 256 MB of virtual memory and the ulimit-respecting code\ndoes not deal with that so programs running under ulimits fail. More generally, the\nulimit is used to size the heap, but we have significant memory resources outside the\nheap - like goroutine stacks! - that must fall under the limit too. \n\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/7672044\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/7672044\u003c/a\u003e has an attempt at this. It mostly works, but it\nfails with SIGBUS on OS X in the net/http short test. I have not yet tried it on Linux -\nperhaps a gdb will be more helpful there.\u003c/pre\u003e",
