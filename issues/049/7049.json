	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eAfter the OpenBSD 5.4 release there was a significant ABI break when a number of\ninterfaces/types were switched to 64-bit values:\n\n  \u003ca href=\"http://www.openbsd.org/faq/current.html#20130813\"\u003ehttp://www.openbsd.org/faq/current.html#20130813\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe ABI break was an intentional decision and no backwards compatibility was provided\nbeyond that needed to cross over. This means that Go tip does not work on OpenBSD\n-current and as things currently stand it will not work in OpenBSD 5.5.\n\nI propose that Go tip be updated so that it works on OpenBSD -current, without backwards\ncompatibility for older releases. This would mean that the minimum version will become\nOpenBSD 5.5 when it is released in May 2014. Anyone running older releases can (and\narguably should) use the version of Go shipped with the OpenBSD release packages. The\nonly other option is for Go to provide forward and backwards compatibility with the\nOpenBSD releases - I do not believe the additional work/effort is sensible, nor should\nthe Go project need to maintain the overhead of doing this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
