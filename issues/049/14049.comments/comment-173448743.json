The sole purpose of the proposed `release` branch is to make `git checkout release` and/or `git pull` work cleanly to give you the latest stable release. \r\n\r\n\u003e There is one question though, should future go1.x tags point\r\n\u003e to the major version specific release branch or the new release\r\n\u003e branch? I can see arguments from both sides.\r\n\r\nIMO the tags should continue point to the relevant commits in the release-branch. Those are the canonical commits. The `release` branch is just a convenience.",
