The method I described creates a single merge commit for each release, nothing more. I don't know why added/deleted files matter?\r\n\r\n\u003e This started as a documentation issue \r\n\r\n@davecheney actually it didn't start as a documentation issue. When we did the conversion to Git in the first place we wanted to make this work, but didn't think of a good way to do it at the time.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I do agree this is of limited utility, probably for a very small audience indeed.",
