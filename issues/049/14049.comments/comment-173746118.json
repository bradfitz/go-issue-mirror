This started as a documentation issue -- the tag\nlisted in the docs tends to lag behind the latest released version of Go --\ncan we solve it as a documentation issue instead. ie, use something like\n$RELEASE_TAG, so the documentation becomes\n\n   git clone https://go.googlesource.com/go -r $RELEASE_TAG\n\nThen we just (ha) have to document how to construct a valid value of\n$RELEASE_TAG.\n\nOn Fri, Jan 22, 2016 at 10:12 AM, Chris Broadfoot \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e Yes, I think that's correct, @dsymonds \u003chttps://github.com/dsymonds\u003e.
