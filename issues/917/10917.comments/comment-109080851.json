	"body": "Hi Rog,  can you clarify a few things for me?\r\n\r\nYou say you never want to rename within all the packages that refer to the renamed symbol, because you do not necessarily have commit rights to them.  Does that mean you are intentionally breaking certain packages?\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when you say you might not have all the packages that use the renamed symbol in your GOPATH, is this another case of intentional breakage? \r\n\r\nThe notion of repository isn't very well defined in 'go build'.  Do you mean the directories immediately beneath GOPATH/src?\r\n\r\nIt should be straightforward to add flags that allow the user to express the disposition of  each package, perhaps using a glob or regexp.  There are several dispositions of possible interest:\r\n(a) this package is to be updated normally.\r\n(b) this package is to be skipped during the update phase.\r\n(c) the whole refactoring should be called off if it would update this package.\r\n(d) this package should not even be looked at.\r\nI'm not sure (b) is necessary.\r\n\r\nLet me think about it for a bit.\r\n",
