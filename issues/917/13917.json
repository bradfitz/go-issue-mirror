	"body": "The current system of using paths like /moretypes/12 is problematic. One is that such URLs are not descriptive. The other is that the numbers change whenever we add or remove a page, breaking existing links. (I have two recent CLs that completely renumber the methods section.)\r\n\r\nWe should change the URLs to use names instead of numbers. For instance, the URL http://tour.golang.org/methods/4 could be http://tour.golang.org/methods/pointer-receivers instead. This adds a new requirement that all pages within a sub-tour must have a unique name, but I think the existing content meets that requirement already, and I don't think it's an onerous burden for future material.\r\n\r\n@campoy - how hard would it be to do this? Looking at the code, I'm not sure how to make the change cleanly.",
