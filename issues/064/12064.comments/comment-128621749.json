I don't think it'll\ntake much effort to make -list more user friendly.\n\nOn Fri, Aug 7, 2015 at 5:01 PM, Brad Fitzpatrick \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e Perhaps. This isn't really a user-visible tool. It's just used by the test\n\u003e infrastructure in the build coordinator.\n\u003e\n\u003e This is easy enough to fix but a) it would preclude listing or omitting\n\u003e any tests that are only known about after a build (none currently, but I'd\n\u003e like to omit stdlib packages from the list if they didn't have test files\n\u003e or test files with the right +build tags), and b) once we do this, then\n\u003e people will file bugs about go tool dist test \u003ctestname\u003e also rebuilding\n\u003e probably.\n\u003e\n\u003e I'd kinda prefer to do nothing.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/12064#issuecomment-128617626\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
