It's just used by the test infrastructure in the build coordinator.\r\n\r\nThis is easy enough to fix but a) it would preclude listing or omitting any tests that are only known about after a build (none currently, but I'd like to omit stdlib packages from the list if they didn't have test files or test files with the right +build tags), and b) once we do this, then people will file bugs about `go tool dist test \u003ctestname\u003e` also rebuilding probably.\r\n\r\nI'd kinda prefer to do nothing.\r\n",
