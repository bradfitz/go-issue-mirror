The\nfield names in literals often provide enough information for the reader to know which\ntype is being used.  Compare:\n\nCurrent spec requires types for struct field values:\n  image.RGBA{Rect: image.Rect{Min: image.Point{1, 2}, Max: image.Point{3, 4}}}\n\nPermit types to be omitted for tagged literals:\n  image.RGBA{Rect: {Min: {1, 2}, Max: {3, 4}}}\n\nPermit types to be omitted for untagged literals:\n  image.RGBA{Rect: {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}}\n  image.RGBA{nil, 0, {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}}\n\nRestricting this feature to tagged struct literals may be sufficient to address\nreadability concerns, especially since people can always include the type if doing so\nimproves readability.  And in some cases omitting the type may improve readability,\nespecially when the field name and the type name are the same or nearly so (such as\n\"Rect\" above).\n\nThis doesn't address your \"style guide\" concerns.\u003c/pre\u003e",
