Feel free to drop me a note at reed [@] hackerone.com.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my comments have derailed this issue way too much, and I do apologize. I only explained stuff about HackerOne because @jbuberel asked for my thoughts.\r\n\r\nWould like to bring the conversation back to focusing on getting Go a vulnerability response policy that works for everybody and ensures all the right things are done. Sounds like people feel Rust's policy is a good start, so seems like getting a draft together based on that would be a reasonable next step. Happy to help with that if needed.",
