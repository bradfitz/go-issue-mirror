	"body": "@jbuberel -- HackerOne isn't just for bug bounties (seems to be a common misconception), and plenty of open source projects use the platform (for free) without paying any bounties at all. It's just a great way to manage incoming reports, interact with the researcher(s), and handle public disclosure in the end. I've always felt that security@ mailboxes are terrible, as it just makes it so difficult to keep up with things, see the current status of issues, and make sure everybody is on the same page. IMHO, the platform speaks for itself, so just take a look at some of the publicly disclosed reports on https://hackerone.com/rails to see how it works in action.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I lead security for HackerOne. Doing my best not to be sales-y at all here (I truly feel the platform works great for dealing with incoming security reports). However, the main thing is just to have a defined process that works for everybody and is followed. Whether that's just some private e-mail address or use of some platform or whatever in the end.\r\n\r\nHappy to help in any way I can... As I said, security is my full-time job, so used to dealing with this stuff and helping out other companies and OSS projects figure out something that works for them.",
