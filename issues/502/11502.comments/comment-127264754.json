	"body": "@fweimer I blame SublimeText for not properly wrapping. A new patchset will be uploaded shortly to address that. Sorry!\r\n\r\nRegarding the early disclosure and embargo, if I understand you correctly, you are suggesting the following process:\r\n\r\n1. Notification is received, threat analyzed.\r\n2. Fixes are created, but patches are **not committed** to the public repo.\r\n3. Send email to distros@openwall with details and patch contents.\r\n4. Wait 72 hours (or 3 business days, etc.) \r\n5. Commit patches to public repo, upload new binary builds\r\n6. Send public announcement.\r\n\r\nRegarding the problem of identifying security-relevant issues, I added a section (below). Let me know if you think that is sufficient.\r\n\r\n### Flagging Existing Issues as Security-relevant\r\n\r\nIf any member of the community believes that an [existing issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues) is security-relevant, we ask that they send an email to [security@golang.org](mailto:security@golang.org). The email should include the issue ID and a short description of why it should be handled according to this security policy.",
