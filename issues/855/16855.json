	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo1.7 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nUbuntu 16.04 LTS X86-64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nIssue #15538 establishes that a process which has loaded a Go shared library (and therefore, instantiated the Go runtime) cannot call fork() and make use of Go code in child processes.\r\n\r\nIssue #15556 establishes that if library is loaded after fork(), everything works fine.\r\n\r\nAlso I understand there is no support for dlclose() for the go shared library.\r\n\r\nMy use case is w.r.t., using a go shared library as a module in apache web server. \r\nI have written a PKCS#11 shared library using Golang. This library is loaded when apache httpd loads mod_nss. \r\n\r\nFollowing is the apache httpd startup flow ( as observed from the stack trace ) \r\n\r\n- Apache httpd main process loads the mod_nss module which in turn loads the PKCS#11 Golang library.\r\n- Loads and validates the certificates for the server\r\n- Forks a child process to serve the http request\r\n- Child process again loads the mod_nss which in turn again loads the PKCS#11 Golang shared library.\r\n \r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/_Eaqnne7vt\r\n\r\nThe code is specific to PKCS#11 library. This is reproducible with any Go shared library which uses net.http package\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nSince the child process is loading the shared library again, I expected the golang shared library runtime to be in a consistent state.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nGolang shared library hangs in net.http package waiting for futex \r\n\r\nGDB Output:\r\n#1  0x00007f32795fb263 in runtime.futexsleep (addr=0xc820022108, val=0, ns=-1) at /usr/local/go/src/runtime/os1_linux.go:40\r\n#2  0x00007f32795e0ff8 in runtime.notesleep (n=0xc820022108) at /usr/local/go/src/runtime/lock_futex.go:145\r\n#3  0x00007f32796041a2 in runtime.stoplockedm () at /usr/local/go/src/runtime/proc.go:1685\r\n#4  0x00007f32796052c2 in runtime.schedule () at /usr/local/go/src/runtime/proc.go:2033\r\n#5  0x00007f3279605741 in runtime.park_m (gp=0xc820000600) at /usr/local/go/src/runtime/proc.go:2140\r\n#6  0x00007f327962c9b3 in runtime.mcall () at /usr/local/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:233\r\n#7  0x00007fffd5e52918 in ??
