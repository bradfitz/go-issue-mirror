	"body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI was trying to use the `pkcs12` package's `Decode` method to read a .p12 file to further generate a TLS certificate and got the following error:\r\n`pkcs12: expected exactly two safe bags in the PFX PDU`\r\n\r\nI looked around the code in `pkcs12.go` and came across what seems to be a typing error. So my question is, should line 68:\r\n`Value asn1.RawValue 'ans1:\"set\"'`\r\nbe:\r\n`Value asn1.RawValue 'asn1:\"set\"'`\r\ninstead?\r\n\r\n**I'm using `go1.6beta1 darwin/amd64` on OS X Yosemite version 10.10.5 (14F1509)",
