It should be\nbuilding the darwin copy, because GOHOSTOS is darwin.\n\nThe make.bash sequence sets GOHOSTOS=GOOS and GOHOSTARCH=GOARCH during the builds in\nthose directories, so it hasn't come up in that context. However, if you are working on\na cross-compiled system it's annoying that you can't leave GOOS set to the target\nsystem. Every time you build a host tool you need to set it back.\u003c/pre\u003e",
