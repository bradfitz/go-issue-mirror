If you\nwant a decimal fraction to reliably turn into an integer when multiplied, you must use a\nfraction that is an exact power of two, which is why I suggested .9375.\n\nThe gc and gccgo behaviour differs because they use very different representations for\nfloating point constants, but both are permitted by the spec.  Gccgo uses\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.mpfr.org\"\u003ehttp://www.mpfr.org\u003c/a\u003e with a 256 bit mantissa.\u003c/pre\u003e",
