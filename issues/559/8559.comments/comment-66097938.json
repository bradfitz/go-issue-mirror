And perhaps this should go to\nthe mailing list anyhow.\n\nThe import path for any package is set by the string used to import it.  The main\npackage--the one that runs the program--is never imported.  So there is no string to\nuse.  Therefore, we use \"main\".  What else should we use?\n\nI think you are asking why, if the main package is imported, that does not set the\npackage for the main package that runs the program.  But if the main package is\nimported, it is not the package running the program, by definition.  It's a different\npackage, an imported one.  In the imported main package, the main function is not\nspecial.\u003c/pre\u003e",
