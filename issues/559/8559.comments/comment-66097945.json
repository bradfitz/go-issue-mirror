Two\ncompletely different \"package main\"s may both define a type T (with very different\nunderlying types) that will both be identified as main.T.  This could be problematic for\nserialization libraries like encoding/gob that expect pkgpath.typename to uniquely\nidentify a type.\u003c/pre\u003e",
