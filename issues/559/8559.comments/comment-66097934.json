If I import the same package under two different import paths\nusing directory hard-links then it is _my_ decision to have different import paths.  But\nwith package main, it is the _runtime_ that is currently deciding to import it under\ndifferent names depending on whether it is built as a command or a package (a decision\ncriteria which is not relevant -- in fact, there should be no decision, just return the\nreal import path).\n\nWhy does the runtime import it as \"main\"?  It makes much more sense to import it with\nits true import path.\n\nYou are using the current behavior to justify the current behavior.\u003c/pre\u003e",
