However, between two builds there is: \nIf a package is built as a command, then PkgPath == \"main\"; whereas if the package is\nimported into another package, then PkgPath == \"the/true/path\".\n\nNow consider if two such builds communicate type information via encoding/gob:  They\nwill see as non-identical two types that should be considered identical.\n\nI guess it's an unlikely scenario, which is why it probably doesn't need to go into Go1.\n But it's clearly an inconsistency.  If you use the name PkgPath then you might as well\nreturn a package path.\u003c/pre\u003e",
