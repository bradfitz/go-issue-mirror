The point is that \\x.go should refer to x.go in the root,\nnot x.go in the current directory.\n\nI was in c:\\rsc\\go\\src\\pkg\\runtime. I ran 'go run \\x.go' and the go command told me it\ncould not open c:\\rsc\\go\\src\\pkg\\runtime\\x.go. That's the right error for 'go run x.go',\nnot for 'go run \\x.go'. What I typed should have resolved to c:\\x.go and did not.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
