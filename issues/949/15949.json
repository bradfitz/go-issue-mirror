	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\ngo1.6.2\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIntentionally made TLS handshake fail, got log to standard out. Wanted to get ConnectionState() of the c.rwc to get the SNI but there is no way to get at it.\r\n\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nBetter error handling in server.go using an ErrorHandler interface that gets a net.Conn and an error as arguments (in addition to a ...interface{} for additional arguments that might be useful) rather than the call to logf that uses log.Logger.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nEnglish log line that doesn't have anything related to the connection in it and no possibility of using translations, or looking into the ConnectionState() tls SNI.\r\n\r\n",
