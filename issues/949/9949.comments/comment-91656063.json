If d \u003c= 0, Truncate returns t unchanged.\n\nThe important part is \"since the zero time\", which specifies a particular instant. That instant was not a day boundary in NZ, so truncating to a day boundary does not land on midnight NZ.\n\nYou could truncate the day info by calling t.Date() and then passing it back to time.Date with some zeros.",
