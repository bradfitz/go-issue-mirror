	"body": "go/types docs:\r\nhttp://tip.golang.org/pkg/go/types\r\nperiodically refer to a package ```exact```. For example:\r\n```\r\nConstant folding computes the exact constant value (exact.Value) for every expression\r\n```\r\nand:\r\n```\r\ntype TypeAndValue struct {\r\n    Type  Type\r\n    Value exact.Value\r\n    // contains filtered or unexported fields\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is very confusing. There is no package exact.\r\nI understand this was introduced during refactoring, but the cost of confused users is higher than the cost of sed invocation.\r\n",
