Maybe just better\ndocumentation?\n\nIn general, For untyped values the conversion provides the type, per the spec: \"A\nconstant may be given a type explicitly by a constant declaration or conversion,...\".\n(go/types/conversions.go:49). When the constant value is an int and the conversion is,\nsay, int64(7), we want to see that it's an int64 value (this is the value that a\ncompiler needs to materialize). For []byte(\"foo\"), the compiler will have to materialize\nsuch a byte slice (and possibly could do so statically).\n\nI think string might be the only exception, so perhaps for untyped strings, the type\nremains untyped string? (But then we break the invariant that reported constants have\nthe materialized type). Or should it be string? But that's technically not quite\ncorrect, either.\n\nAny suggestions?\u003c/pre\u003e",
