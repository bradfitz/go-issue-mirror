I expect the buffered channel perf improvement work to help for this\ncase.\n\nWhat about the stat collection application? We've tried a channel based\nimplementation (let many goroutines send stat update through channel and\nhave a receiver goroutine that updates the stats.)  and a mutex-based\nimplementation (let many goroutines fight for a single mutex to update the\nstats). None was satisfactory.\u003c/pre\u003e",
