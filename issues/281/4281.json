	"body": "by **jacobsa@google.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI started a golang-nuts thread for this (\u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/D7Gvt)\"\u003ehttp://goo.gl/D7Gvt)\u003c/a\u003e but never got a\nresponse for my final question.\n\nCalling `http.Get` or `http.Do` without changing any of the default settings\nuses keep-alive connections; you can verify this by running the program Russ\nposted in the thread I linked above. However, the docs say this:\n\n\u0026gt; DefaultTransport is the default implementation of Transport and is \n\u0026gt; used by DefaultClient. It establishes a new network connection for \n\u0026gt; each call to Do [...]. \n\nThis seems incorrect, unless I'm misreading it. Re-using a cached keep-alive\nconnection means that a new network connection is *not* established for each\ncall to `Do`, right?\n\nThe docs for the `Transport` type agree with the actual behavior, implying\nthat its zero value will use keep-alive connections (due to a zero value for\n`MaxIdleConnsPerHost` implying `DefaultMaxIdleConnsPerHost`, which is two).\u003c/pre\u003e",
