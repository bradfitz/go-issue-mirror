It does so by forking a go routine that calls println and sleeps for a\nmillisecond waiting for output. \n\nThe assumption that the output can be completed in a millisecond or less is an\noptimistic one.  When the machine running the test is sufficiently loaded completing the\noutput might take substantially more than a millisecond.\n\nRaising the timeout might make this test less flakey.\u003c/pre\u003e",
