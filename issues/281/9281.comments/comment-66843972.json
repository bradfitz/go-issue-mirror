	"body": "Yeah, that means everything is not text, and I just checked on Windows, it\nworks.\nBecause every file is not text, git will not try to do any eol conversion.\n\nHowever, the whole system is not that simple. see\nhttp://adaptivepatchwork.com/2012/03/01/mind-the-end-of-your-line/\n\nTo recap our requirements:\n1. we have files with crlf eol style in the repo (for\nexample, misc/makerelease/windows/installer.wxs),\nand we probably want to keep that file in crlf eol style.\n2. we don't want git to convert text files to crlf eol when checking out,\notherwise a lot of tests will break.\n3. do we want to make git convert certain sources (*.go, *.html, basically)\nwith crlf style to lf style when\nchecking in?\n\nThat post recommends setting:\n*.txt -text\nif we want that \"these files will never run through the CRLF to LF\nreplacement.\", and this will\nsuffice for requirement 1 and 2 listed above. What about 3? Setting \"*\n-text\" will allow people to\naccidentally checkin source files in crlf eol style. Should we enforce\nthis? In pre-commit hooks?\nby git-review?\n\nbtw, the new system works from git 1.7.2 and above, so we need to require\nat least git 1.7.2.",
