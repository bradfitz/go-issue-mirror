	"body": "I think that you can hard wire WM_CLOSE into sending lifecycle.StageDead. The lifecycle stages, such as \"visible\" or \"focused\" are per-window, not per-app. If an app is single-window, it can translate lifecycle.StageDead to return from the app.Main func-typed arg (i.e. exit the app). If an app is multiple-window, it's up to the app to count how many windows are still open. All of the example programs so far are single-window apps. We should probably add a multiple-window example app at some point, but it hasn't been a priority.",
