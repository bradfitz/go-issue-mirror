My test harness for this bug was\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/drwd1JwnTd\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/drwd1JwnTd\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nSuccess or failure\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nHang\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n5g\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nOS X 10.8.4\n\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo version devel +f31759c38a32 Mon Sep 23 13:19:08 2013 -0400 darwin/amd64\n\nhg bisect shows that this bug was introduced by\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=7afd81b7fe122e743f0db88f538eb3b4004be650\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=7afd81b7fe122e743f0db88f538eb3b4004be650\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI don't know whether cross-compilation or linux/arm5 is necessary; it is just how I\nreproduced it here. There may also be something else unusual about my setup here.\n\nCompiling for host (OS X) does not reproduce the problem, including with CGO disabled.\n\nLet me know what other info I can provide.\u003c/pre\u003e",
