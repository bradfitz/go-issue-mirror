	"body": "The Android implementation of the sensor package need to initialize a ALooper. ALoopers must be accessed from the same OS thread, therefore each operation on the package must be done on a goroutine that is locked to an OS thread.\r\n\r\nThe current mechanism accepts new messages through a signal channel depending on the signals type, invokes the required functions and sets the return values. It requires each function call to be represented with a different input signal.\r\n\r\nThis mechanism could be simplified by making the locked goroutine consuming a chan of functions.\r\n\r\n``` go\r\ntype inOut func(done chan struct{})\r\n\r\nm.inOut \u003c- func(done chan struct{}) {\r\n    // do something on the locked goroutine\r\n    // when done, close done.\r\n    close(done) \r\n}\r\n```",
