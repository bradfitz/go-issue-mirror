It does not match name-addr because the initial\n\"joe@example.com\" would need to match display-name =\u0026gt; phrase =\u0026gt; word =\u0026gt; atom,\nbut the @ character is not a valid atom character. The formal rendering of the address\nwould need to be:\n  \"joe@example.com\" \u0026lt;joe@example.com\u0026gt;\n\nHaving said all that, standards compliance is a noble goal, but strict compliance is not\na hard requirement. We could easily make the net/mail parser more liberal in this\nregard. Have you encountered email addresses of that form in the wild? Are they common?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **packagechange**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
