Similarly, I don't think we want an image.BGRA type.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, it might have been more efficient for interop with other C libraries if the standard type was image.BGRA instead of image.RGBA. On the other hand, the PNG order is RGBA. In any case, that horse has bolted.\r\n\r\nFor an alternative approach to dealing with BGRA interop (e.g. X11, and presumably cairo uses the same byte order), grep for \"swizzle\" under golang.org/x/exp/shiny/driver.",
