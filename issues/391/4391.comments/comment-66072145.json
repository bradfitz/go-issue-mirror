That's what SIGTTIN means it is a /dev/tty read attempt from a\nprocess that was stopped by SIGSTOP.\n\nThere are a couple of problems as well actually. For example Go sets all the signal\nhandlers with SA_RESTART, but frankly it would be nice to have an ability to interrupt a\nsyscall by a signal. SIGTTIN is one the cases for that.\n\nAnyways, I think we can workaround all that if we try really hard, without bug reporting\non Go a lot. :)\u003c/pre\u003e",
