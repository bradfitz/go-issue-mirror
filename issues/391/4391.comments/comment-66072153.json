I can only see SIGIO (since we're using that\nnow in termbox) when godit is active (in foreground), after C-z strace shows no activity.\n\nHave you updated the termbox-go library? Try the full update: `go get -u\ngithub.com/nsf/godit`. It can't be an OS specific issue as C-z works only under linux .\u003c/pre\u003e",
