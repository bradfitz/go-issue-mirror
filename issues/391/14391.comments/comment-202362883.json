One very common example is defining a `TLSClientConfig` (without losing the timeouts).\r\n\r\nNot sure if I like typeassert-dereference-copy or copy-paste more, but both will break HTTP/2 if `DefaultTransport` is special-cased.\r\n\r\n@bradfitz @rsc, did any discussion happen on simply ignoring `ExpectContinueTimeout` to avoid magic behavior?",
