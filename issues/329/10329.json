	"body": "Currently, the audio player has a naive OpenAL backend that buffers the entire source into the memory to prepare the media. We currently can only recommend the audio player to play small audio files such as sound effects.\r\n\r\nIn order to relax this restriction we should limit the generation of OpenAL buffers and reuse them as the source is done processing. The number of buffers to be generated are limited on some platforms, such as iOS, to certain number. The rate of processing, and the host device's resources are both critical in the determination of the number of active buffers.",
