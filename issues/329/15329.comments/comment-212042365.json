	"body": "This sounds like a bug in the current compiler and what you're proposing is a band-aid for a symptom, not a fix of the underlying cause.\r\n\r\nWhen evaluating f(e1, e2, e3) we should evaluate (completely, as far as can be observed) f, then e1, then e2, then e3.  The spec says so.  I'm not sure why we're hopping around evaluating parts of the e's in zigzag order.  My guess is that it was done to improve codegen in the legacy compiler.\r\n\r\nMaybe you've just found a corner case in the \"as far as can be observed\" logic, and we just fix that.",
