	"body": "OpenGL ES 3 is a large extension to ES 2, offering a large number of new features. Eventually we should have support for it.\r\n\r\nI propose we do so by having a new package that contains the extra enum values and functions, which can be used in conjunction with the existing gl package.\r\n\r\nThis is a very low priority item as ES 3 is not currently usable on Android. 72% of devices only support ES 2, so all software today must first target ES 2 and only use ES 3 as an optional extension.\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html#OpenGL",
