At the same time, it says\n\"Server sites SHOULD NOT use any configuration which permits a\nplaintext password mechanism without such a protection mechanism\nagainst password snooping.\"\n\nI think the proper way to handle this in the client is to check\nwhether the PLAIN authentication mechanism was advertised. In other\nwords, replace the simple \"!server.TLS\" check at\nsrc/pkg/net/smtp/auth.go:56 (go 1.0.3) with something that looks\nthrough server.Auth entries. This way, the server decides what is\nallowed. I do the same thing in my IMAP library, permitting the LOGIN\ncommand only when LOGINDISABLED capability is not advertised.\n-------\u003c/pre\u003e",
