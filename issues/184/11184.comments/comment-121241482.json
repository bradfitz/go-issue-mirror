Almost all the changes already exist in various CLs from Minux but were never merged, or in the case of some, are now in files that have moved to other directories.  With these changes, external linking for ppc64le at least works in most cases (although I agree there are probably some bugs as noted in the previous comment).  Without these changes it doesn't work at all.",
