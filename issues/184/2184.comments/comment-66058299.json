The same curl\nversion and command also worked fine after an upgrade of IIS (as well as the two\nclients).\n\nThe symptom in Go when connecting to a server like this is that many back-to-back\nrequests may receive the response from a previous request, and the HTTP package will\neventually start saying that it received unsolicited responses.\n\nI will respond when I hear back about the version info, and then see if I can't find a\nwebsite on the internet using that version.\u003c/pre\u003e",
