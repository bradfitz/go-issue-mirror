	"title": "crypto: check parameters to avoid potential remote denial-of-service attack",
	"body": "Go's crypto libraries passed certain parameters unchecked to `math/big.Int.Exp` (https://golang.org/pkg/math/big/#Int.Exp), possibly leading to extremely long-running computations, which in turn makes Go programs vulnerable to remote denial of service attacks. Programs using HTTPS client certificates (a non-zero `tls.Config.ClientAuth` value of https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#ClientAuthType) or the Go SSH server libraries are both exposed to this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis is CVE-2016-3959 and was addressed by https://golang.org/cl/21533 for `crypto/dsa` (the reported problem) and https://golang.org/cl/21560 (similar change to `crypto/rsa` and `crypto/ecdsa`, despite no known path to make those go into the slow path).\r\n\r\nThanks to David Wong for identifying this issue.",
