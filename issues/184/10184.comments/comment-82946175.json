	"body": "Apparently this issue has the side effect of resulting in inconsistent test runs whether you run `go test` against a relative path (like `./...`) or an absolute (import-like) path, like `github.com/user/pkg`.\r\n\r\nNamely, if you run `go test ./...`, and your test files live in `package foo_test`, and they import `foo`, but they rely on something exported under `*_test.go` files (a common example is the`export_test.go`, like the one in `pkg fmt`), `go test` will import the package from `$GOPATH`, not from wherever `go test ./...` is run (which makes sense). However, as @faizoff mentioned, the `*_test.go` files are not included in those builds (not even in tests builds, when the package being tested is other than the package that is imported, minus the `_test` suffix).\r\n\r\nThis usually never happens because people tend to run `go test ./...` while they're in the source tree. However, it does happen with the new Wercker Ewok, which runs Go tests in a different directory (`/pipeline/source`). This results in CI tests that use `go test ./...` failing, while CI tests that use `go test github.com/user/pkg/...` are passing.\r\n\r\n/cc @hatchan",
