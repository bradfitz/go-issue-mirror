	"body": "Go version 1.4.2 release\r\nOS: Linux amd64\r\n\r\nThe go install command doesn't pick up structs and functions which are defined in source file with names xxx_test.go\r\nI know go test command uses _test.go files as part of the built in testing framework. In case I am building a lib, and I write tests in _test.go files (define some functions etc.) and run them from package main, but at present those definitions won't be visible and go install throws an error: undefined: TypeName\r\nIs it possible that go install/build can be trained to throw a more verbose error message: For example: Definition found in xxx_test.go, please change the file name to something other than xxx_test.go",
