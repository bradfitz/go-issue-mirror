It would be easy to send a string and call errors.New(s) on the\nreceiving side. It may even be possible to do better, like ask if the type can GobEncode\nitself first.\n\nWorth thinking about and addressing carefully, if at all. GobEncode in the errors\npackage is not the answer.\u003c/pre\u003e",
