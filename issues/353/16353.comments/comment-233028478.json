	"body": "@rfliam, nothing on the x/mobile audio proposal is actually mobile specific and I am not willing for us to end up with different representations for audio.\r\n\r\nThese interfaces and a big majority of the encoders/decoders should probably live outside of x/mobile. Hence, I am interested in your proposal and x/media.\r\n\r\n@crawshaw had a few concerns about originally suggesting that location when we are initially working on the proposal. The x packages need to be maintained and there is not a single person who can work on full-time. Our ideas seem to be drafty at the moment and we are moving slowly. Promising an official package is a big responsibility given the quality of packages from the Go project.\r\n\r\nA side note, I am happy with renaming the proposal to be about generic audio if everyone agrees there is no good reason why it is not so.",
