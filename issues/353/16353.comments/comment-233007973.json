	"body": "@rakyll Thanks for the heads up! \r\n\r\nYour proposal mentions:\r\n\u003e TODO(jbd): Proposal should also mention how the decoders will be organized. e.g. image package's support for png, jpeg, gif, etc decoders.\r\n\r\nEven a small subset of common decoders will represent a large set of code. It seems to me adding an `x/media` package would be prudent. This also exposes these decoders and parsers for use _outside_ the mobile project without requiring other dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf people would prefer we can move discussion to that proposal. However, it seems more focused on providing playback API's on mobile. I had hoped to add generic media parsing operations for all go users that such a library could then rely on.",
