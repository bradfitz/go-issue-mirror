Particularly, as the original poster mentions,\nwhen you use examples like this in the tutorial.\n\nIf it requires some special magic to make it work intuitively there should at least\nbe a big fat note in the tutorial where you introduce this feature. But honestly,\nhaving to jump through hoops to make (apparently) obvious things work will seriously\nimpact the uptake of the language.\u003c/pre\u003e",
