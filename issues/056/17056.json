	"body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nhttps://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httputil/ has some garbage I'd like to hide. I'd like to hide everything about *ClientConn* and *ServerConn*\r\n\r\n### Background:\r\n\r\nBefore Go 1, we renamed the `http` package to `net/http` and in the process deleted some junk, and moved other junk to `net/http/httputil`, thinking that people might still need it. This was all pre-Go 1 when the APIs were changing daily, weekly, monthly. But we were trying to be nice anyway.\r\n\r\nTurns out nobody needed that junk, though, even then, and not today:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026q=httputil.ClientConn\u0026ref=simplesearch\r\nhttps://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026q=httputil.NewClientConn\u0026type=Repositories\u0026ref=searchresults\r\nhttps://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026q=httputil.ServerConn\u0026type=Repositories\u0026ref=searchresults\r\nhttps://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026q=httputil.NewServerConn\u0026type=Repositories\u0026ref=searchresults\r\n\r\nZero results.\r\n\r\nI updated the docs some time ago:\r\n\r\nhttps://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httputil/#ClientConn\r\n\r\n... says simply:\r\n\r\n\u003e ClientConn is an artifact of Go's early HTTP implementation. It is low-level, old, and unused by Go's current HTTP stack. We should have deleted it before Go 1.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e Deprecated: Use Client or Transport in package net/http instead.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple good bits in there, though. `ReverseProxy` is very widely used, and the `Dump*` functions are often used in debugging.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nLet godoc have configuration on public symbols to treat as if they were private. And then use that configuration for godoc.org to hide that junk, without deleting them from the package, so we don't violate the Go 1 compatibility promise. Think of this as a very strong form of deprecation.\r\n\r\nIf users really want to see it, they can use https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httputil/?m=all to see all the junk.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n*But Brad, this is a very slippery slope. What will we hide next?*\r\nGood question. There might be more to hide.\r\n\r\n*But why?*\r\nBecause httputil looks embarrassing, and it looking like a trash heap prevents us from non-embarrassingly adding anything else to it. Let's clean up the house before we invite guests over.\r\n\r\n/cc @griesemer @adg @broady @quentinmit @minux @campoy ",
