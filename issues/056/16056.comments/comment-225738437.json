I just ran it on these two machines manually with root, it constantly passes on one machine while constantly fails on the other.\r\n\r\nstrace on the failure machine shows\r\n```\r\n# strace -f ./syscall.test -test.v -test.run=Unshare\r\n...\r\n[pid 17296] unshare(CLONE_NEWNET)       = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nMaybe kernel configuration (The machines may have different kernel configurations)? Is there something I can check?\r\n",
