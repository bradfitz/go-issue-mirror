What did you do?\r\nHello, I am writing a POC software that should replace a currently running C application.\r\nThe server part loads a SQLITE db3 file in memory (using maps) and then waits for text commands on UDP socket.\r\n\r\nThe client reads a text file with commands, sends them to the server and waits for a response.\r\nThe client takes measurement on server reply time.\r\n\r\nMy tests were taken on the same machine (localhost) to avoid network delays\r\n\r\nWhile running the client, response time jumps from 3 milliseconds to more than 200 milliseconds\r\nand in the same moment the server displays this line (I am running it with `SET GODEBUG=gctrace=1`)\r\n\r\n`gc 14 @18.400s 2%: 0.50+380+1.0 ms clock, 2.0+294/380/266+4.0 ms cpu, 344-\u003e344-\u003e182 MB, 359 MB goal, 4 P`\r\n\r\nI think that 200ms STW is a bit too much and would like to know how to fix this beahvior\r\nI have a dropbox folder with server and client sources, and corresponding SQLITE DB and command text file\r\n(https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e2timsyjifvp61i/AAAmDoKSP7NANjDlsYcGcBvGa?dl=0)\r\n\r\nthe client must be executed with 2 parameters:\r\n- serverip:port (4420)\r\n- sendername (L1)\r\n\r\nMy concern is not the throughput but the latency\r\nOur application drives an automated machine that must have the response back in 10ms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
