Or are you using it against non-Google hosts for things like go-endpoints?\r\n\r\nYes :)\r\n\r\nThe generator that is part of the google API go client project is used by other companies to generate their own Go clients.\r\n\r\nAt CloudFlare we use it to generate a Go client for a 3rd party system that is documented by JSON Schema, and so we are then using Go http/2 to call a Nginx http/2 server that fronts a Glassfish of the 3rd party API.\r\n\r\nThis specific project has been stuck on Go1.6.1 for a while not knowing where the root cause of the issue was. Salman and I finally looked into it and got to the bottom of it... Opaque handling in http/2.",
