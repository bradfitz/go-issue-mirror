Or at least wait until Go 1.8 for any fix.\r\n\r\nThere's no good place to document this, so I could just fix it in the common case: if we would send a `:path` starting with `https://HOST/`, replace it with `/`. But not if the HOST != Request.URI.Host, to be conservative probably. In that case I'd just return an error early rather than violate the protocol.\r\n\r\n@broady opened https://github.com/google/google-api-go-client/issues/161 to update google-api-go-client using the Go 1.5 API added to replace Opaque.",
