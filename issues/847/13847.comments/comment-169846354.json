The existing API based on the importer.Lookup type for flexibility is unfortunately inadequate, and at the same time unimplemented (a non-nil Lookup function was not supported). That is, it's not possible to have any users yet.\r\n\r\nThis opens the door to a backward-incompatible change. At the same time we don't want to design in a vacuum (as we did on short-notice before 1.5 in this case). Probably better to leave this for early 1.7 when we also get the new import data which should clear things up.\r\n",
