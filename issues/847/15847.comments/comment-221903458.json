Could you send up the complete before and after gctrace? How many goroutines does the application have and what is the nature of the goroutines work.\r\n\r\nWhen reading the gctrace line you sent. The 2% is the overall time spend in GC. the 0.50 and the 1.0ms are the STW times. The 380ms is the time spent doing the concurrent mark. During the concurrent mark we have seen the GC starve the mutators (your application) in certain situations and fixed several things in this area for 1.7.  You might want to try tip to see if this will be a problem going forward. ",
