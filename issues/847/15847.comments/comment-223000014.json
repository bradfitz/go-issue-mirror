	"body": "Interesting. So, I think I've reproduced the problem in a small(ish) test case. The trace of that test case does confirm my hypothesis that the garbage collector is taking over the one P that's running user code and for some reason the user goroutine isn't getting moved or stolen. I thought GOMAXPROCS=3 would mitigate this, but it turns out it just changes its nature: the fractional worker only gets 75% of a P, but that's still enough to starve the user goroutine on that P for long stretches. The trace also confirms another thing the gctraces are showing: we're often not spinning up idle mark workers on the idle Ps.",
