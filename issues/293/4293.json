	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIf /usr/local/go already exists, the Mac package installer simply overwrites the\nexisting files. That's not okay.\nEither:\n\n(A) we don't want to overwrite existing files, in which case the installer should bail\nout and explain.\n\n(B) we do want to overwrite existing files, in which case the installer should remove\n/usr/local/go/* before proceeding.\n\nThe current behavior means that installing over an old tree leaves behind any old files\nthat have been deleted in the new tree (so they were not overwritten). If you install\nover a pre-Go 1 tree with a Go 1 install it leaves src/pkg/time/sys.go and\nsrc/pkg/time/sys_posix.go, which have imports of \u0026quot;os\u0026quot;, which causes a\nmysterious import cycle loop when trying to do anything.\u003c/pre\u003e",
