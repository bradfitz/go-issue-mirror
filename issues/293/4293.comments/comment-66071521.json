It seems you must write a plugin and\ninstall it through the PackageMaker UI.\n\nI am going to attempt to make the package simply remove the old go installation without\ninforming or prompting the user.\n\nAlso, there was a bug introduced in package.bash by (I think)\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/5666046/\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/5666046/\u003c/a\u003e\n\npackage.bash can not locate the dist tool as the directory to which it is installed has\nchanged. I've fixed this bug, but I don't know if I should commit it as part of THIS\nissue, or make a new issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
