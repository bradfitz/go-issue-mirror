	"body": "@ianlancetaylor Actually, I have tested my C code by using `valgrind`. It told me that there is no memory leaks and everything is okay. I also used a loop(10000 times), to `malloc` and `free` the memory, but nothing crashed.\r\nIn the C code, `printf(\"%d\\n\", *rgcmap);` tells you the address allocated by `malloc`. And the error occurs in Go(line 78 `fmt.Print(\"address\", svc.maps)`), which means the Go can not access to the `maps` of `svc`. Am I correct?",
