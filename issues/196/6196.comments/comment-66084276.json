The error you\nreported appears to be consistent with hashmap corruption. We saw some reports identical\nto this when khr's new hashmap code landed in Jan (that went into 1.1).\n\nCould I ask you to build a race enabled build of your client, and see what that turns up.\n\nCheers\n\nDave\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: removed **go1.2maybe**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
