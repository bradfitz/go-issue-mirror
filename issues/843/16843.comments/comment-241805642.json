You can even do that using the GC information we're discussing passing down a channel.\r\n\r\nI do think there is a race here, but in the opposite case - if code is sitting in a tight loop making many small allocations, your channel read/callback might not run in time to actually trigger a new GC soon enough without OOMing.",
