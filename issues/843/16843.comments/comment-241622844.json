It just didn't fit the proposal process, and we also didn't want to decline it, nor close it as a dup of #5049.\r\n\r\nChanging the language is out of scope, so all discussions of things like catching memory allocation failures, language additions like \"trymake\" or \"tryappend\", etc, are all not going to happen.\r\n\r\nBut we can add runtime APIs to help out. That's what this bug is tracking.\r\n\r\n/cc @matloob @aclements \r\n",
