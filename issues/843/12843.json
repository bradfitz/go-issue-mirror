	"body": "The spec provides a way to enforce [limits on header block size](https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#rfc.section.10.5.1). Without this feature, clients may cause a server to buffer arbitrarily large headers in memory before servicing the request. Through careful but simple crafting of HPACK encoded cookie headers, a malicious client is able to achieve an over 4000x amplification from bytes on the wire to server memory used with quadratic string garbage generation.\r\n\r\nI would expect the http2 server to advertise a reasonable SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE by default (possibly lifting the MaxHeaderBytes field from the http.Server) and enforce it. Potentially, although maybe deserving a separate tracking issue, the cookie header should not use string concatenation as it would still remain a target for massive garbage generation with the existing defaults.",
