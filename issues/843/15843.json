	"body": "For Go 1.8 we probably need to stop marking args live for the entire function call. It just doesn't fit with the sophisticated analyses being done by the SSA back end. Programmers will have runtime.KeepAlive already in Go 1.7, so people doing Go 1.8 beta testing will be able to update their code in a (Go 1.7-)backwards compatible way. And maybe we can find some way to help people find problems faster. It's going to be quite a band-aid to rip off.\r\n\r\nBut see [my recent comment](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15277#issuecomment-221768072) in #15277 for the pain we're in if we don't do this.\r\n\r\n/cc @randall77 @aclements @RLH @dr2chase ",
