(See man 2\nftruncate)\n\nActually, if you look at the man page, EBADF / EINVAL is only used for the\n\"fd is not open for writing error\", so the error is not ambiguous.\n\nIt's not feasible for the os package to try to provide better error message\nthan what the underlying syscall provides in every case.\n\nPS: when debugging this kind of issue, I suggest using strace.",
