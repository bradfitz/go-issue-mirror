I just spent a few hours trying to figure out why my code wasn't working (my project involves joining various filesystems through an abstraction layer, which is then shared over NFS, so it could've been a couple of different things going wrong), until I decided to try various snippets of it on a windows machine. Once I had the windows error message it was just a few moments before I knew exactly what was wrong and why.\r\n\r\nMy issue isn't that the messages are different. It's that the message in Linux is so un-useful.",
