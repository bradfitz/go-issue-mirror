It seems that for any function signature with foo(a ...T), it will\naccept parameters from a function with multi-value returns, but for any other forms\n(e.g. foo(b string, a ...T)), it does not. The compiler will consider the return is in a\nsingle-value context. This looks like a language limitation though, not really a bug per\nse.\n\nOn the flip side, if we were planning to fix it, I'd suggest we could support a syntax\nsomething like this: foo(a, f()...) where f()... denotes to assign multi-value returns\nto the []T slice.\u003c/pre\u003e",
