Or is\nthere another ssh server we should use?\n\nI am not aware of any particular ssh server for Windows. But I am sure there are many\navailable. Windows used to come (maybe still does) with built-in telnet server itself.\nOr we can, probably, build our own out of Go’s ssh server package. But what are you\ngoing to do once connected to that remote cmd.exe? I fear you won’t be able to do\nmuch. Windows command line tools are pathetic as far as I am aware. You will be able to\nbuild Go programs, maybe run gdb, but nothing else. What are you planning to do once\nconnected?\n\n\u003e RDP isn't a great answer.\n\nRDP will allow you to do anything you want. It is the only way commonly supported by\nMicrosoft. RDP will work in pretty much any situation.\n\n\u003e We want a common interface (ssh) to all builders.\n\nFair enough. But, like I said earlier, it might work in a particular scenario, but not\nfor a general purpose access.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
