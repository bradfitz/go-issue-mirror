The code in `av_read_frame` may do something akin to `*pkt = *queued_packet`, which may have set the `priv` filed to initialized data. That field has been removed, and has long been deprecated for a reason, and I'm not confident that all the internal packet functions properly initialized that field or zeroed the structure â€” you may be seeing unitialized data there. priv should be NULL in that example (it was mostly only set for e.g. Video4Linux2 capture device). I would love to try and repo/look into it, and save @ianlancetaylor some time if it's our fault. It should be easy to test.\r\n\r\nSorry if this is noise!",
