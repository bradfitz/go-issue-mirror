	"body": "Thanks for looking into this.\r\n\r\nThe cgo pointer checks should only going to complain about Go pointers (that is, pointers into Go memory) that appear in Go memory.  I have not looked at the code, but it sounds like C++ is taking uninitialized memory and copying it into Go memory, and that some of that uninitialized memory has a pointer type.  If that is what is happening, then you have a big problem, and it's a good thing that the cgo pointer check is catching it.  The garbage collector is not going to work properly if it can see invalid values with pointer types.",
