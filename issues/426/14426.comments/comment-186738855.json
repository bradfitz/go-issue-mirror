	"body": "For the same input file, it reliably crashes, although it takes a different amount of loop iterations, and changing the code changes the amount of iterations.\r\n\r\nhttps://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/2.8/structAVPacket.html is the definition of the AVPacket struct. The pointer checker is complaining about the `priv` field, a `void*`. The values of `priv`, for my input file, look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n0x400f6f\r\n0x7ffdc93fd4e0\r\n0x7ffdc93fd4e0\r\n0x7ffdc93fd4e0\r\n0x7a4f00\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last value is considered a valid Go pointer, as it points into the bss section.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked into the meaning of the priv field or how ffmpeg comes up with the values. However, I do wonder if it demonstrates a more general problem with the way cgo checks for Go pointers. C can put arbitrary values in those fields (or simply not initialize them), and may not necessarily intend to ever access them as pointers.",
