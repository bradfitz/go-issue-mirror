	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe field tags in package xml were one of the earliest uses of tags\nand need to be cleaned up, like json was cleaned up.\n\nSpecifically, the field lookup should look for an identical match,\nnot a case-insensitive or 'strip the invalid characters' match.\nAny custom matching should be done with field tags, not heuristics.\nThe field tags should use attributes like json does instead of \noverloading certain names.  For example it is impossible today\nto unmarshal an XML tag \u0026lt;attr\u0026gt; because the \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; tag means\n'make this field an attribute'.  It is also impossible to choose a\nname for that attribute.\n\nSpecific changes needed:\n   * Fields match only if the field name matches the element name\n     exactly (for field with no tag name) or matches the tag name\n     exactly.\n   * Field with \u0026quot;-\u0026quot; tag is ignored completely.\n   * Attributes are marked by \u0026quot;,attr\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;x,attr\u0026quot; tag, not just \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;.\u003c/pre\u003e",
