A small feature request for future \"xml\" package versions.\n\nI had a need to filter xml elements by their namespace, consider this example:\n\n\u0026lt;package\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;include name=\"GObject\"/\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;include name=\"Gtk\"/\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;c:include name=\"glib-object.h\"/\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;c:include name=\"gtk/gtk.h\"/\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/package\u0026gt;\n\nSo, I would like to unmarshal that into a struct with two arrays for each namespace:\n\ntype Package struct {\n  Includes []Include\n  CIncludes []Include\n}\n\nAnd currently such thing is impossible as far as I can see. \n\nAlso attributes may have namespaces as well. Parser understands that, but there is no\nway to use attribute namespaces with struct tags. E.g.:\n\n\u0026lt;method name=\"get_comments\" c:identifier=\"gtk_about_dialog_get_comments\"\nversion=\"2.6\"\u0026gt;\n  ...\n\u0026lt;/method\u0026gt;\n\nMaybe though attributes cannot have matching local names in xml, I don't know.\n\nP.S. It's a shame that there is so much real world data in this perverted format.\u003c/pre\u003e",
