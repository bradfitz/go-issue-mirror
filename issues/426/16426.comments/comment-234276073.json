	"body": "Thanks for your timely response!\r\n\u003e surely you could walk the decoded struct and perform the same validation separately with a different package, no?\r\n\r\nNo, it is not possible in some situations without decoding the data twice. For instance, how do you perform the required/noExtraFields validation by walking the decoded struct?\r\n\u003eAny interest in the encoding.Validator interface? I could write a formal proposal if there are enough interest.\r\n\r\nAlthough the encoding.Validator interface you suggested does not mean the same thing, it does provide new thoughts to solve similar problems, and gives more flexcibility. I support you. Please go ahead with a new proposal!\r\n\r\nBack to the proposal I suggested, if it cannot be accepted, I will make an implementation in a separate package. I believe that more people will benefit from it.",
