It won't target the widest audiences.\r\n\r\nMy counterproposal:\r\nWe introduce a encoding.Validator interface, and if the just unmarshaled\r\nfield supports this interface, encoding/* package will call it and return\r\nthe error if the verification failed.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to be careful not to make existing types accidentally\r\nimplement the new Validator interface.\r\n\r\nThis also somewhat related to the recent node-level error message issue\r\n(#16433) on encoding/json. We could pass location information to the\r\nvalidator.\r\n",
