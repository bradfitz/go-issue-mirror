Perhaps the assembler was confused by SP being both a physical and virtual register.\r\n\r\nGiven that it assembled properly on Go 1.4 and Go 1.5, should this regression be fixed for Go 1.6.3?\r\n\r\nUpstream issue: https://github.com/golang/snappy/issues/29\r\n\r\nUpstream workaround: https://github.com/golang/snappy/commit/ec642410cd033af63620b66a91ccbd3c69c2c59a\r\n\r\n@randall77 @robpike ",
