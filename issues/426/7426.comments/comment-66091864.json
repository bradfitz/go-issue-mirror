The results, reordered by code flow.\n\nBefore:\n-----\n547   openDir succeeded\n3593 openDir failed and fell back to openFile\n3592 openFile succeeded\n1       both failed\n\nAfter:\n----\n3592 openFile succeeded\n548   openFile failed and fell back\n547   openDir succeeded\n1       both failed\n\nSo, it trades 3593 failed openDir for 548 failed openFile.\u003c/pre\u003e",
