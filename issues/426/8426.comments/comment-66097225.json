Unlike libev, libuv has a\nconnect function.\n\nuv__tcp_connect is defined in this file:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/joyent/libuv/blob/9b4f2b84f10c96efa37910f324bc66e27aec3828/src/unix/tcp.c\"\u003ehttps://github.com/joyent/libuv/blob/9b4f2b84f10c96efa37910f324bc66e27aec3828/src/unix/tcp.c\u003c/a\u003e\n\nline 127 is the connect call\n\nline 149 adds the file descriptor to the poller.\n\nThis is platform agnostic behavior with the exception of windows.\n\nHere is the code for windows \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/joyent/libuv/blob/master/src/win/tcp.c\"\u003ehttps://github.com/joyent/libuv/blob/master/src/win/tcp.c\u003c/a\u003e\n\nhandle-\u003efunc_connectex is called before REGISTER_HANDLE_REQ, which as far as I can tell,\nmeans connect is called before the polling function on windows as well.\n\nlibuv appears to have unit tests for all of this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
