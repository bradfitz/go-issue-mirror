What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nlinux/ppc64le and linux/ppc64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nppc64/ppc64le lacks runtime checks for hardware capabilities / ISA levels. These will be important as we start to add runtime optimizations for POWER8/POWER9, so they don't break compatibility with older processors. We will need to read the HWCAP/HWCAP2 values from the auxv for this verification.\r\n\r\n",
