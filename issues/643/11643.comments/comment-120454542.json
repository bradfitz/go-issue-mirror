A few questions:\r\n\r\nCan you run this with GODEBUG=gccheckmark=1?\r\n\r\nCan you say something about what's happening at the caller of assertI2T2 (/redacted.go:30 in your traceback)? In particular, I'm curious about where the value that you're type-asserting came from. I'm guessing it came from the second word of a struct, and that we failed to mark that containing object, but it would be nice to know if that's right and anything you can say about that containing object.\r\n\r\nFinally, is this  the same program as #11644?",
