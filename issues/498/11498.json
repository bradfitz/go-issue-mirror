	"body": "After seeing the following message (that looks like an error) I found a stray `println` that doesn't seem to be very helpful since there is retry logic in place. The program's exit code was 0 and the results were as expected so there actually wasn't a problem.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/netpoll_epoll.go#L72\r\n\r\nI'm proposing that the stray `println` be removed unless it is otherwise helpful or necessary.",
