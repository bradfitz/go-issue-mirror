Nothing ever closes it.\r\n\r\nWell, that's trivial, you just do:\r\n```go\r\nsyscall.Close(7)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003e We're going to see a program that loops endlessly printing the same message over and over.\r\n\r\nThat's what netpolllasterr for.\r\n\r\n\u003e The original issue report says that the program completed normally.\r\n\r\nI think normal completion is pure luck in this case. If it would wait on some network IO, it would hang because epoll is broken.",
