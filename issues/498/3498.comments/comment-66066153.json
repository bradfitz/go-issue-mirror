You are first to complain :-)\n\nI am not keen implementing it myself, unless it is really really simple. I have never\nused symlinks myself. For what you are asking, we could add support for os.ModeSymlink\nin os.FileInfo. But it is not the end of the story, is it? What exactly do you need?\n\njp created symlink support implementation \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/4984050/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/4984050/\u003c/a\u003e a while\nago, but I rejected it, because no one was using it. It is out of date now. Feel free to\npropose whatever changes you need yourself.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-windows**, **packagebug**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
