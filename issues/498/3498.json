Create a directory link using \u0026quot;mklink /D \u0026lt;Link\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Target\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\n2. Create another regular directory\n3. Figure out which of the 2 is a regular directory and which one is a link\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nTo be able to tell when something is a link to a directory instead of a directory, and\nwhere it links to\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe only function I've found that seems to be able to tell something about symbolic\nlinks on windows, is when comparing them using os.SameFile, however, this only helps if\nyou know a target to compare it with\n\nI have tried a whole bunch of functions in the os and filepath packages, but they are\neither not supported on windows, or give the exact same stats when it's a link or when\nit's a directory\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nWhichever one comes with the .msi installer\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows 7 Professional 64-bit\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo1\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
