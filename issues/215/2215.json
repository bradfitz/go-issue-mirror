	"title": "windows net: replacement for /etc/protocols",
	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hg update default\u0026quot;, rebuild, and\nretry\nwhat you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Attempt to open an IP raw socket with ListenIP or DialIP, with a netProto argument of\n\u0026quot;ip4:icmp\u0026quot;\n2. Send packets out using this socket\n3. dump the packets with Wireshark or equivalent\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe protocol on the packets is expected to be 1, meaning \u0026quot;icmp\u0026quot;\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe protocol on the packets is 0.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows XP SP2\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\ngomingw, release \u0026quot;gowin32_release.r59\u0026quot;\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nIn src/pkg/net/iprawsock.go, function readProtocols(), a platform specific assumption is\nmade, namely that the protocols file is named \u0026quot;/etc/protocols\u0026quot;. On Windows XP,\nit is named \u0026quot;C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\protocol\u0026quot;. Note that not only is\nthe directory different, but the word \u0026quot;protocol\u0026quot; is singular instead of plural.\n\nMy suggested fix would be any of the following:\n\n1. Switch to using the C library function \u0026quot;getprotobyname\u0026quot;, which exists on\nboth Windows and UNIX/POSIX and probably OS/X and plan9. This is in keeping with the way\nservices and hosts are looked up, in lookup_windows.go and lookup_unix.go.\n\n2. Hard code a set of well-known IP protocols and use it if /etc/protocols is not found\non the system.\n\n3. Choose which file to read based on the platform.\u003c/pre\u003e",
