Keep in mind that the \"newest\" version of gotype is in the std lib go/types directory - you need to build it yourself (there's a separate issue filed to make gotype \"go get\"-able again (from x/tools). I have just checked that (std lib gotype) code and I believe it's using the latest version of the go/importer which supports vendoring.",
