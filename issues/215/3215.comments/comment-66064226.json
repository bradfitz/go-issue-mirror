Should probably be %ProgramFiles%\\Go (which expands to\nC:\\Program Files\\Go on a default english language install of Windows)\n- 64-bit installer is not aware that it is a 64-bit installer. When I manually set the\ninstall path to C:\\Program Files\\Go, it installed to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Go (the\n32-bit bin path) instead. Windows does this automatically to installers that do not\nidentify themselves as 64-bit aware.\n- GoDocServer shortcut is added to the desktop without asking (that I recall). Installer\nshould at least ask.\n- GoDocServer shortcut has insufficient quoting. When installed to a location with\nspaces in the path, clicking on the icon produces \"Windows cannot find 'Files'. Make\nsure you typed the name correctly, and then try again.\" Removing the /d option to start\nand moving the path to the \"Start in:\" field of the shortcut appears to work.\n- As others have noted, GOROOT is not set by the installer, and go is not added to\n%PATH%. After setting these manually, using go is smooth.\n\nThis is on Windows 7 Ultimate x64\u003c/pre\u003e",
