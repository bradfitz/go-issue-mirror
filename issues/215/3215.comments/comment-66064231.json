I turn off the \"smartscreen filter\" and other stuff MS\ntries to enable by default, so I can't comment on potential issues there. Part of me\nhopes developers will have the sense to have these turned off already, but some may not\ndue to large company policies or are just starting to program...\n\nWorks great to compile from source with tdm-gcc 64 and hg.  Windows 8 no longer\nadvertises cmd.exe in favor of Powershell.  If questions arise, make sure people are in\ncmd.exe (if in Powershell, need to run: \"start cmd\").\n\nSome text directly in the installer itself about how godoc works (http server, requires\na firewall exception) might be useful.  May want to add an option in the installer at\nsome point to add exception to windows firewall for godoc server. Exceptions in firewall\ncan be either port based or application based.\n\nI greatly appreciate all the effort that has gone into making Go an awesome\ncross-platform tool.\u003c/pre\u003e",
