	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.5.1, 1.6.2\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nlinux_amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nI have a /etc/resolv.conf file with three DNS servers configured. If the first one isn't working properly, the net.LookupHost function will not try to use the other two DNS servers. It used to try all the DNS servers in 1.4.2. But I tested the function in newer versions such as 1.5.1 and 1.6.2, but I get an error saying the first DNS server couldn't resolve my hostname. \r\n\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
