On the slower\nNetBSD server, the tests don't cut it, so that is no benchmark - but the build does\ncomplete successfully, at least.\n\nIt remains to check under Ubuntu (again, GO386=387) and Plan 9 (I'm way behind on that,\nso I expect the worst) where GO386=387 is the default in at least one instance.  Testing\non Plan 9 is not an option right now, many things are still broken.\n\nI'll be submitting a patch for review as soon as I have completed the practical tests.\n\nLucio.\u003c/pre\u003e",
