If you want to try a contribution (writing a patch and pushing it down to review process), please include a few test cases that satisfy the point of views above; both dual IP stack and IP routing behavior--from unspecified addresses (0.0.0.0 or ::) to specified addresses for source and/or destination address selection with validating IP address reachability.",
