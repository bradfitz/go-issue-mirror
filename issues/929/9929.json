	"body": "Currently go apps are limited by 64K outgoing connections when running on hosts with multiple IP addresses if local IP address is passed to net.DialTCP(). This limit can be eliminated when setting SO_REUSEADDR sockopt to the socket before connection establishing according to https://idea.popcount.org/2014-04-03-bind-before-connect/ . Below are the corresponding quotes from the article:\r\n\r\n* When using the bind before connect trick only a single connection can use a single outgoing source port. With SO_REUSEADDR flag, it's possible for many connections to reuse the same source port, given that they connect to different destination addresses.\r\n\r\n* If you need to select a source IP manually, for whatever reason, normally you'll be limited to one outgoing connection for one ephemeral port: destination address is not taken into account. This limits number of outgoing connections considerably.\r\n\r\n* Therefore if you need to specify a source IP consider setting SO_REUSEADDR flag to enable address reuse. This will increase number of possible connections, but you will need to handle possible connect() EADDRNOTAVAIL errors.\r\n",
