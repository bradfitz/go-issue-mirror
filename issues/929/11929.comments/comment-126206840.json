The internet tells me that the Galois field multiplication that's at the top of your profile (implemented in Go right now) can be done efficiently using the PCLMULQDQ instruction. Maybe that makes up a large part of the performance gap to OpenSSL.\r\n\r\nI can't locate any previous discussion of GCM-specific hardware acceleration in issues or on the mailing lists.",
