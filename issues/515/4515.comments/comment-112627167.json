The tags seem to apply correctly during the build but the package gets skipped if no files are left *before* \"applying\" tags.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, for any package that may be disabled by tags, just make sure some file is left over that is not guarded by tags, such as `doc.go`.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this should be filed in another manner.",
