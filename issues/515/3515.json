	"body": "by **kballard**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eGo source files can use relative import paths (e.g. import \u0026quot;./foo\u0026quot;) to specify\npackages relative to the current file. However, `go get` doesn't understand these paths.\nIt should be smart enough to allow relative paths, evaluating them against the path to\nthe current package, and only complaining if the path tries to descend too far (e.g.\noutside of the root of the enclosing source repository).\n\nNot only will  this make it easier to be `go get`-compatible, but it also fixes the\nextremely annoying problem of having to update all import paths that refer to\nsub-packages when forking someone else's project (and the ensuing problem how to\ncontribute back to the original project without including these path changes).\n\ngo version go1 on darwin\u003c/pre\u003e",
