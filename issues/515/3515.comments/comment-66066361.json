We understand the\nadvantages, but there are also disadvantages.  The most important one is that you cannot\ntell what a source file imports unless you know where it was found: copying a source\nfile changes the meaning of its imports.  This is not a good property for a language\nthat is trying to be explicit and clear about dependency management.\n\nSo, sorry, but we're not going to allow local imports in go get'able code.\n\nAlso note that when you use local imports in other code, it means you are giving up on\nincremental compilation: the object files for local imports are never installed, so they\ncannot be reused.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
