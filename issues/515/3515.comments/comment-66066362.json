I can't think of any other languages that have that property. In fact, even\nin Go I can't copy a single source file out of a project and still expect it to work,\nbecause packages can be (and often are) split up across multiple files. And if I'm\ncopying all of the files in a package, it's not that much of an imposition to copy\nsub-packages.\n\nI would understand this as an argument against allowing \"..\" in an import path, but it\njust seems like a very weak argument against allowing \"./foo\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
