Using go version go1.5.1 darwin/amd64, my build (presumably mostly link) time is:\r\n\r\nreal\t0m2.879s\r\nuser\t0m3.584s\r\nsys\t0m0.461s\r\n\r\nFor a very modest program. Building with -x shows that compile, and link are running only for the main package, which contains no fancy build directives.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how else to report this, but it is a concern that build times are inflating version over version.",
