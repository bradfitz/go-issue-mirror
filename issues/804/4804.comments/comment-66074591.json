So the driver doesn't need to parse the DSN again. Maybe the driver also\nqueried some server vars which could be taken over instead of querying them again or\nthere are some other checks / operations a driver might skip.\n\nSo the first connection is opened with Driver.OpenInitial(dsn) and for all further\nconnections opened internally by the sql package just Conn.Clone().\u003c/pre\u003e",
