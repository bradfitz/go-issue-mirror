I've ended up implementing that myself a number of times.\n\nAlternatively/additionally, I'd like to see a *DB and optional Driver way to do:\n\n// Ping returns whether the database is available.\nfunc (*DB) Ping() error\n\nBut ignoring Ping for now, I think Open getting (\u0026 maybe returning or returning in n\nseconds) a connection is a good default policy.\n\nBut I'd like drivers to be able to opt-out of it.  I'd make a new optional interface on\nDriver like:\n\n// OpenInitialer is an optional interface that may be implemented by drivers which\n// have a preference on whether an initial connection is created on sql.Open to\n// determine the health of the database.  OpenInitial should behave exactly like\n// Driver.Open, but the ErrSkip value may be returned to indicate that an initial\n// connection should not be opened.\ntype OpenInitialer interface {\n\tOpenInitial(name string) (Conn, error)\n}\n\nWant to do this?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
