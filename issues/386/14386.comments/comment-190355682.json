	"body": "I guess for a package containing assembly the assembler will produce .obj files directly and the go tool will simply add these to the zip file the compiler produced?\r\n\r\nThe abstract says \"I propose to change both Go package archives and Go object files to use the more standard zip archive format.\" but is really mostly about package archives isn't it? I guess the .o files the compiler and assembler currently make are somewhat containerish, and the *.obj files will just contain the part that follows the \\n!\\n bit in the current .o files? (I wonder, for the sort of object file redesign I propose in #11123 maybe it would make sense to have the *.obj file be replaced by a directory in the zip containing files like symtable, strings, data, etc...)",
