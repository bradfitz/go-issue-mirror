	"body": "The primary focus of this bug is definitely server support because that's where adding lameducking causes an API change. I think the client isn't quite handling things correctly though, as receiving a GOAWAY should cause the client to close any streams that are above the received LastStreamID, and I can't find any code to do that. I guess that's a bug in the client that we can handle separately.",
