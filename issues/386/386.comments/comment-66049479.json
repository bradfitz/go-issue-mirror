Perhaps the kernel is unable\nor unwilling to accommodate Go's writing to the LDT.\nI'll leave this as WaitingForReply because I'd like to know for\nsure what's going on, but we'll need someone on a Xen system\nto debug this.  Maybe there is documentation somewhere\nabout Xen disallowing such system calls.\n\nAnother thing to try is to run the binary using: strace -f 8.out\nand see what system call strace thinks is running when the\nkernel gets upset.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **helpwanted**, **os-linux**._\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
