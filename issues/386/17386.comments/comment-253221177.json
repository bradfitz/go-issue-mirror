I'm not saying we copy the solution there, as I'm not entirely happy with it, but we could copy the terminology, where it is called Key.\r\n\r\n\"Key\" is definitely simpler and makes more sense than \"canonical/non-canonical\" to me.\r\n\r\nIt probably makes sense to match the collate package's API at first; I don't think that would stop us from adding on a transformer like method later if we wanted, and we'll probably want the simple \"just do this operation on bytes or a string\" functions regardless of what other APIs eventually get added (if any).",
