Each call allocates a buffer, fills it, and does a single\ncall to the \nwriter when it's done.  There is no shared state.\n\nThe writer might not be safe, but it usually is.  I think what's happening is that the \noperating system is occasionally interleaving pieces when some internal buffer fills up \nand a scheduling event occurs.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Invalid**._",
