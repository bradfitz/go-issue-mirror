The fmt code looks perfectly safe,\nas does the writer.\n\nI've re-run Print_Bug_Chan.go on the latest release:\n    d7bffcaba314 tip\nand the problem persists.\n\nBy comparing the two output files (one from single thread which is ok, and one from\nmultiple threads, \nwhich has problems) and using sort , grep, and wc there are some interesting\nobservations:\n\n1. The corrupted file is smaller (but just barely) than the correct file:\n    450 bytes smaller 527,780 versus 527,330\nThis suggests there might be more places in the i/o system that do not deal with the\nnegative counts that \ncan be returned (as in some of the recent bug fixes).\n\n2. There are more complete messages missing than missing bytes:\n   485 instances of \"subroutine\" missing  19,515 versus 20,000\n Also, there are more \"Entering\" messages missing, than \"Leaving\" messages:\n   407 Entering messages missing, only 78 Leaving messages missing: 9593 versus 9922\nI don't know what to make of this...\nIt is interesting that 407+78 = 485, i.e no corruption in the first two words of the\nthree word messages.\n\n3. There does not appear to be any corruption in the messages included in the file. (It\nwill take a little more \nwork to verify that all of the numbers at the end of the messages are correct.)\n\nShould I continue to \"comment\" on this Issue? (since it is marked Invalid) Or should I\nopen another issue, \nwhich does not point to fmt?\n\nKen\u003c/pre\u003e",
