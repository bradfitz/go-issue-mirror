If you need something\nfancy, it is always possible to use strings.SplitN instead\nof making Sscanf increasingly more complex.\n\nUsing %*s here would be particularly unfortunate, since it\nhas a different meaning in C's scanf.  (The * means\nparse the field but don't save it into an argument.)\n\nA nicer approach would be to make regexps have a\nScan method, so that you could say\n\n    var format = regexp.MustCompile(\"([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) (.*)\")\n    format.Scan(line, \u0026id, \u0026salary, \u0026name)\n\nbut we're not there yet.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @robpike._",
