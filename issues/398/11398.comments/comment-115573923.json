	"body": "Yes, I missed the errors!! Ops!!\r\nBut what is the best way to check for the errors with defer???\r\n\r\nI thought `gzip` was like a filter, compressing whatever `bufio.Writer` passes when it does it. \r\nLike an extra layer between the writer and the file object compressing the data. It seems I was wrong, but how can I deal with an application that can write both normal and compressed files depending on the input? If `gzip.Writer` sits on top of `bufio`, I need to change the writer I pass to the function that actually writes when I change the output file type. Or not?\r\n\r\nRegarding the docs, my opinion is that some examples should be written both in a tutorial (blog/tour) and in the docs (maybe something shorted/simpler). But this is only my opinion. At least, maybe a link to the tutorial placed in the docs page would help.",
