You typically want to buffer writes to the file (`gzip -\u003e buffer -\u003e file`), not writes to the gzip compressor (it doesn't care how big or small your writes are). Also you shouldn't ignore the errors from `Flush` and `Close`.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm saying is: I agree this should be better documented. I don't think `compress/gzip` is the right place to do it, though.\r\n\r\nI think we should add a solid section to the tour about working with the `io` interfaces. Or even a blog post would do.",
