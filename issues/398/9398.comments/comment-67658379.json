Although I did not have root, running `cat /dev/log/main` in `adb shell` returns `No such file or directory.`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I attempted to work around this issue by adding\r\n\r\n    defer func() {\r\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Hello, world.\")\r\n\t\tif r := recover(); r != nil {\r\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Golang Panic:\", r)\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}()\r\n\r\nTo the top of my function, to no avail.
