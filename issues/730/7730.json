	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eFrom the golang-nuts thread at\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/forum/#\u003c/a\u003e!topic/Golang-nuts/PJD1NAlm1Eg\n\nThe play program at \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/JTAZnTb6am\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/JTAZnTb6am\u003c/a\u003e immediately shows \u0026quot;Error\ncommunicating with remote server.\u0026quot; because whatever error occurred was cached.\n\nYou can bust the cache by tweaking the program slightly (comments won't do -- try\nchanging the Printf format string) and you'll see that sometimes the program will, in\nfact, give a response after some time (although it suffers from \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/7728\"\u003eissue #7728\u003c/a\u003e).\n\nThe playground shouldn't cache errors of this type; it can make perfectly good programs\nstop working. Two or three times in the past I've seen this occur with normal (much less\npathological) programs as well, forcing the user to change a variable name or something\nin order to make it work again. \n\n(Unfortunately I don't have any of those other links available.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
