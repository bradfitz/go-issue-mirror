If a blank line is inserted\nbefore the build constraint in foo.go the compilation succeeds as expected (inserting\nanother line of comments is not sufficient).\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\ndarwin, linux\n\nWhich version are you using?
