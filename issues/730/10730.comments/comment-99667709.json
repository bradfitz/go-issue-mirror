I believe that the root cause of this issue is just passing a corrupted ICMP packet to the kernel. Certainly the 4-year-old test cases need to be updated for the recent restricted kernels.\r\n\r\nIn addition, from Go 1.5, the full stack test cases for IPConn have been moved to the following:\r\ngolang.org/x/net/ipv4\r\ngolang.org/x/net/ipv6\r\ngolang.org/x/net/icmp\r\n\r\nI'm happy if buildbots can support to run tests in x/net with administrator privilege eventually.",
