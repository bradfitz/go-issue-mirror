	"body": "by **rayneolivetti**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe attached code calls an assembly function that doesn't escape anything.\nWhen marked with //go:noescape, it causes crash.\n\nI originally bumped into this when switching to 1.2rc3 from 1.1.2 (am64). The original\n(and lengthy) code strangely runs okay with 1.1.2 whereas the test case causes panic\nwith 1.1.2 as well.\n\nThis made me believe that the problem exists in both version, so I will try to find the\n\u0026quot;missing element\u0026quot; that lets this one slip with go 1.1.2.\n\nBy the way, is I move u and v to the global scope, the problem disappears as well.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/6730/0/escape.go\"\u003eescape.go\u003c/a\u003e (169 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/6730/0/escape_amd64.s\"\u003eescape_amd64.s\u003c/a\u003e (117 bytes)",
