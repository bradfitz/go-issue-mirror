	"body": "by **surajn.vnit**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat does 'go version' print? go1.3 linux/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\nSetup -\n- Front end HTTP server implemented using Go. It requests 1 backend service over HTTP.\nFront end service waits for 10ms or the response from the backend service, whichever\nearlier and sends response to the user.\nCode - \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/rE0Q7N2nmT\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/rE0Q7N2nmT\u003c/a\u003e\n- Back End Service - HTTP service implemented using Go. Accepts request, sleeps for 5ms\nand responds back.\n- Concurrency test: weighttp -n 10000 -c 2 -t 1  -k \u0026quot;\u003ca href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8084/\u0026quot\"\u003ehttp://127.0.0.1:8084/\u0026quot\u003c/a\u003e;\n \nWhat happened?\n1. Number of connections with the backend service in TIME_WAIT kept on increasing\n(\u0026gt;5000 at the end of test)\n2. Changed the MaxIdleConnsPerHost to 4. Number of connections to backend service is\nconstant at 4 and are in ESTABLISHED state.\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n1. Ideally 2 to 4 persistent connections are sufficient to handle this much load. But\nevery connection after the limit MaxIdleConnsPerHost is reached, I think is not\npersistent. This leads in too many connections being established and broken. This can in\nturn bring the system down - which I am seeing at a little high concurrency.\n\nThis can be an issue for a service which have to communicate 100+ backend HTTP services,\nas we cannot keep very high limit for MaxIdleConnsPerHost.\n\nCase 2 is the expected behavior. So if MaxIdleConnsPerHost is sufficient, then there is\nno issue.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThis can be the possible duplicate of\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/6785\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/6785\u003c/a\u003e.
