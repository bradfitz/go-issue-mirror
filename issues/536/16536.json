	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.6 , using branch release-branch.go1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nRhel 7.2 \r\n\r\n3. What did you do and what's the result?\r\nThe ./all.bash command fails for me inside the docker container with the below error: \r\n   Error : --- FAIL: TestHostname (0.00s)\r\n   os_test.go:1287: fork/exec /bin/hostname: no such file or directory\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nAll the tests should pass.\r\n\r\n5. My analysis\r\nI found that the issue I am getting is exactly similar to issue #14693. Hence when I tried applying the patch for this particular issue in my work environment; I found that all the tests were passing. \r\n\r\nI would like to know if we can cherry-pick the fix for issue #14693 and merge it into the branch release-branch.go1.6, (which I have done for my environment to verify if it works).\r\nPlease note that this commit is not found in the particular branch.\r\n",
