My own understanding (and the\nimplementation) of unexported names has been that it is\nas if lower case names are invisibly annotated with the\npackage they came from, so that the name private from\npackage hiding is different from the name private from\npackage main.\n\nThe bug is because the compiler screwed up, but I would\nlike to make sure that the spec allows this program too.\u003c/pre\u003e",
