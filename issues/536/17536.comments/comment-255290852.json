	"body": "If you write `exec.Command(\"ls\")` then I think the os/exec package should invoke /bin/ls passing `\"ls\"` as `argv[0]`.  The user of os/exec should be able to control the `argv[0]` passed to the program.  For your case I think you should be calling `exec.LookPath(\"ssh\")` to get the value to pass to `exec.Command`.\r\n\r\nIf there is a bug here, I think it is only in the documentation.",
