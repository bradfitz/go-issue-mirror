On 2011-09-06 it\nchanged to always do the system call on a static link.  In a dynamic link, it looks for\nthe VDSO address.  It looks like something has changed in the Fedora kernel.\n\nLooking around on the net, I find this: \u003ca href=\"http://lwn.net/Articles/446528/\"\u003ehttp://lwn.net/Articles/446528/\u003c/a\u003e .  The\nvsyscall's are apparently being removed from newer versions of the kernel.\n\nI guess we are going to have to drop back to making the system call, which is\nunfortunate since it will be slower.  This affects syscall.Gettimeofday and syscall.Time\non amd64 GNU/Linux.\u003c/pre\u003e",
