	"title": "go: Dividing a floating-point number literal by an integer should be an error",
	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the\nlatest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Compile the below code:\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n        \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n        fmt.Printf(\u0026quot;%v\\n\u0026quot;, 1.0 / 2)\n        i := 2\n        fmt.Printf(\u0026quot;%v\\n\u0026quot;, 1.0 / i)\n}\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n(Compile error)\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n0.5\n0\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.1 linux/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI understood the reason but it is surprising. If I use the number literal '1.1' instead\nof '1.0', a compile error happens.  This looks inconsistent to me.  I think it is better\nto raise an error when dividing a floating-point number literal by an integer.\u003c/pre\u003e",
