For this particular case (large data with no pointers allocated on stack) it could probably be allowed to pass, but if pointers are in the large data a phase-after-escape-analysis moves such large stack allocations to the heap, potentially leaking stack pointers into the heap.  That is my recollection, at least -- we replaced a potential difficult-to-analyze Heisenbug with a compile-time-error with a workaround.",
