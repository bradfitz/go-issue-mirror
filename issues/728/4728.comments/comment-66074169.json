I have a version that\nuses an instrumented version of the crypto/rsa crypto/x509 code (added fmt.Printlns).  \nThat shows that x509/verify.go fails to build a chain of trust between the server\ncertificate and the CA list in buildChains.\n\nx509/cert_poo.go findVerifiedParents comes up with a candidate certificate, but fails to\nverify the signature.\n\nI'm perplexed at the error.  I generated the certificates, I know that server1_cert, is\nsigned by ca-cert.  I think that three crypto implementations agree with me (openssl,\ngnutls, and the netscape/mozilla code).  But I won't rule out errors on my part.\u003c/pre\u003e",
