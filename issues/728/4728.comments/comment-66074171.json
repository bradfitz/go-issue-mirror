ASN.1 requires that positive numbers with the most-significant-bit set be\nprefixed with 0x00, and these certs don't do that. \n\nThat took a while to track down but I'll change the code to return a more helpful error\nmessage in the future.\n\nI think you might have a second problem (the bad MAC error) so please get back to me if\nthat's still happening with valid certs.\u003c/pre\u003e",
