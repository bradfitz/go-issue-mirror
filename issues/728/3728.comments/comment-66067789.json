I would like to suggest that this issue be closed as there\nare a number of problems going on here, and the fix to one causes another, making it\nhard to determine a clear path to resolution. In its place, with your permission, I\nwould like to open two new issues;\n\n1. Address the test timeout with math/rand using softfloat.\n2. Address the unsupported VPF3 floating point instruction on the Pi.\n\nHow does this sound ?\n\nCheers\n\nDave\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @davecheney._\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
