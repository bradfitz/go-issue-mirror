	"body": "Furthermore, I can't reproduce it any more. I have turned off go vet execution to be able to work on a program and now, when I have turned it back on, it does not panic.\r\n\r\nPossibly it is somehow connected to update of a go lang.\r\n\r\nI had some other go-tip version installed before today. Today i went to ~/go, did\r\n```\r\n$ git pull\r\n$ cd src/\r\n$ ./all.bash\r\n$ cd ~/goprojects/...\r\n$ make \r\n```\r\nand saw that go vet crashes. Then I commented go vet execution in Makefile and continued my day.\r\nNow, after you asked me for a reproduce case, I have tried go vet and it works.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am saying that possibly after upgrading go lang and without recompiling everything (I didn't delete $GOPATH/pkg, go vet crashes. But after recompiling everything, go vet is fine.",
