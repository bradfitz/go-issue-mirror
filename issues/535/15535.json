What did you do?\r\njson.Unmarshal refuses to deserialise JSON into a custom interface var, even though the var (interface) points to a concrete object.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\njson.Unmarshal should be able to inspect the concrete object behind custom interface to deserialise JSON, instead of throwing message \"cannot unmarshal object into Go value of type \u003cinterface name\u003e\"\r\n\r\nFull example, including a workaround:\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/arj2sWQQnC",
