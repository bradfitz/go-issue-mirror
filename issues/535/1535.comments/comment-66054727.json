They're not like switch statements or for\nstatements, where you can reasonably switch multiple cases\nagainst true or use an infinite loop and a break.\n\nYou would never write\n\n    if {\n        always executed\n    }\n\ninstead of\n\n    {\n        always executed\n    }\n\nunless you wanted to end it with\n\n    } else {\n        never executed unless there is a goto into here\n    }\n\nwhich is more than a little weird.\n\nThe symmetry with switch and for was justified early on,\nbut it interacts poorly with the \"new\" semicolon rules.\nMaybe it's worth changing.\n\nLeaving for gri and r to discuss.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **g...@golang.org**._",
