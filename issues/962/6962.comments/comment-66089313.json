That python file should state exactly what you just wrote and let the\npackagers evaluate if we need to include that python.  And state it again in the install\ndirections.  My binary hello world built with a reference to a python file, so you have\na dependency on python (or code you should delete).\n\nHow in the world is my issue invalid?\u003c/pre\u003e",
