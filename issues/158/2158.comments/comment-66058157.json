It seems currently that Go's code checks for domains with a\nleading dot. So for example if no_proxy=example.com then a request for foo.example.com\nstill goes through the proxy. However if no_proxy=.example.com then it doesn't go\nthrough the proxy. I don't think other clients have the same requirement.\u003c/pre\u003e",
