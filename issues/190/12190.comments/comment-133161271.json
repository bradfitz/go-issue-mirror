The change looks good to me even though it appends a trailing dot unconditionally when GODEBUG=netdns=cgo and the name is stored in local database such as /etc/hosts. I now think it's fine because /etc/hosts could be considered as a substitute for some DNS RRs; A, AAAA, PTR (and CNAME on some platform), and actually mDNS speaker implementations use it as a source of RRs.",
