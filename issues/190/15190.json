What did you do?\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/qZ-RocY8nm\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nOutput should be:\r\n1s\r\n2s\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n1s\r\n1s\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWhen calculating a Duration that crosses a leap second, go reports an incorrect duration.  Note that in the playground example we are parsing UTC time and the UTC standard requires adherence to leap seconds.  \r\n\r\nThis also means that the definition of the zero value of `time.Time` is incorrect. \r\n\r\nThe documentation states: \"The zero value of type Time is January 1, year 1, 00:00:00.000000000 UTC\".  This is incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe zero value of time.Time is actually  `January 1, year 1, 00:00:26.000000000 UTC`",
