	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIt's a feature request.\nCurrently runtime has the PREFETCH(addr) macro and the runtime.prefetch(addr)\nimplementation in assembly. The prefetching is used in GC. As measurements show,\nimplementing the PREFETCH(addr) as compiler intrinsic (w/o function call overhead) can\nprovide ~5% or so performance boost to GC:\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/5991057\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/5991057\u003c/a\u003e\nFor 386/amd64 it needs to emit PREFETCHNTA instruction. For other archs it's OK to make\nit no-op.\n\nIt's not high priority, and depends on amount of resources required to implement it. If\ntakes a day or so then it may be worth pursuing.\nI am planning to use it in few more places in GC. However I doubt it will be used\nanywhere else, at least I do not see obvious opportunities.\u003c/pre\u003e",
