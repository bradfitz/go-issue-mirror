It does not use mksyscall_windows.go. Why are you telling me about github.com/tompng/pokemon-go package?\r\n\r\n\u003e In my configuration, GOROOT and GOPATH have same prefix part C:\\dev\\go but not same directory as you can see in above. But mksyscall_windows.go handle those as same. So the code made by mksyscall_windows.go are generated as pkgStd because IsStdRepo doesn't check trailing path separator as delimiter.\r\n\r\nYou keep repeating yourself. I understanding that you think there is a bug here. And I don't disagree with you. But I would like to see the bug by myself. Please provide some code or commands to demonstrate the bug. Show us some real computer output, and explain why that output is wrong in your opinion.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAlex",
