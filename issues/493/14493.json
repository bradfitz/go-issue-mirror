	"body": "The encoding/json package marshals RawMessage properly or incorrectly as base64 based on whether its container is marshaled by value or as a pointer, which is extremely subtle and trivial to get wrong silently.\r\n\r\nIt also consistently fails to marshal the RawMessage value properly when used as a map value type.\r\n\r\nSample code demonstrating these problems:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/bHuvfyb7qB\r\n",
