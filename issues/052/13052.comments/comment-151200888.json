When the go tool uses cgo on systems that use the GNU binutils, it passes --build-id=none to disable the generation of a build ID.  This has worked for the GNU binutils for a long time, but it may not work for your very old version.\r\n\r\nThe choices I see would to update your GNU binutils, edit the go tool to remove the --build-id=none, or put a shell script on your PATH named ld that removes the --build=none option and then invoke the real ld.\r\n\r\nClosing because I don't think there is anything for us to do.",
