I've seen another report (don't have the url handy) on golang-nuts of a similar problem, so consider this issue a reminder to someone, probably me, to check that the 1.4.2 installer is working on the latest os x 10.10.x.\r\n\r\nSpecifically if `/etc/paths.d/` doesn't work with zsh, I think our options are limited, but it used to work properly with the default os x shell.",
