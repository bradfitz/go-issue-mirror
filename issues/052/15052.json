	"body": "On tip, the file net/ipsock_posix.go has these lines\r\n\r\n    \t\tif ip = ip.To4(); ip == nil {\r\n    \t\t\treturn nil, \u0026AddrError{Err: \"non-IPv4 address\", Addr: ip.String()}\r\n    \t\t}\r\n\r\nIt's pretty clear here that the `ip.String` stored in `AddrError` is using the wrong `ip`.  This code will always set the `Addr` field to `\"\u003cnil\u003e\"`.\r\n\r\nThe same error occurs a few lines down using `To16`.\r\n\r\nI would send in the obvious fix, but the effect would be to change the `Addr` field from `\"\u003cnil\u003e\"` to `\"?\"`, which is only barely an improvement.  We probably need to fix these cases in ipsock_posix.go and also fix `IP.String` to produce more useful output for an unrecognized length.",
