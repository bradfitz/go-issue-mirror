	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n```\r\ngo version go1.6.2 darwin/amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nAs above, darwin + amd64. Running OSX 10.11.4\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nRan `go vet` for the following code:\r\nhttps://github.com/prashantv/vetrepro\r\n\r\nBasically has a `foo.go` with:\r\n```go\r\npackage vetrepro\r\n\r\ntype Container struct {\r\n\tList StringList\r\n}\r\n\r\n// StringList is a list of strings\r\ntype StringList []string\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd a `foo_test.go`:\r\n```go\r\npackage vetrepro_test\r\n\r\nimport \"github.com/prashantv/vetrepro\"\r\n\r\n// This causes a failure\r\nvar _ = \u0026vetrepro.Container{\r\n\tList: vetrepro.StringList{\"hello\", \"world\", \"asdasd\", \"asdasd\"},\r\n}\r\n\r\n// This works even though it's essentially the same.\r\nvar list = vetrepro.StringList{\"hello\", \"world\", \"asdasd\", \"asdasd\"}\r\nvar _ = \u0026vetrepro.Container{\r\n\tList: list,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nNo errors from `go vet` for both places were I create `vetrepro.StringList`.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nAn error for the first case (where the `StringList` is created inline when setting the `List` field), but no error for the second case, where the `StringList` is created separately from the `Container`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go vet .\r\nfoo_test.go:7: vetrepro.StringList composite literal uses unkeyed fields\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the issue is that `vet` needs the installed packages, I'd expect that **both** cases would be affected.\r\n`go install` does fix this issue, but I'm not clear why the error is inconsistent between the 2 cases.",
