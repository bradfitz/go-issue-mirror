I\nstill have never seen the problem myself and I have no explanation for why you have. \nAccording to the gdb backtrace the program is crashing during initialization.  I don't\nknow why that would be affected by the use of -flto.  The relevant code is all inside\nlibgo.so.  It hasn't even gotten to your main function at that point.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @ianlancetaylor._",
