	"body": "I'm of the opinion this should be closed as \"Won't fix\". There is no intrinsic reason I'm aware of this could not be provided by a third party package. The api for this package could look something like:\r\n```\r\nSchemaNames(db *sql.DB) ([]string, error)\r\nSchemaObject(db *sql.DB, name string) ([]sql.ColumnType, error)\r\nSchema(db *sql.DB) (map[string][]sql.ColumnType, error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nInternally it would look at *sql.DB.Driver() to determine the database type (or run a query), then run database specific queries to return the schema type.\r\n\r\nIf this is implemented as a third party package, I think we could re-open this. But until then I believe this should be closed.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This issue is for returning database schema metadata, not for returning query metadata. Query metadata does need support from database/sql and is being considered.\r\n\r\n",
