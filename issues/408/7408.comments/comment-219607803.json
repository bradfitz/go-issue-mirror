	"body": "Golang had the promise of becoming the next multi-platform tool of choice with, in my opinion, so many advantages over Java (compiled code, more efficient runtime, much quicker startup times and so on). For a lot of business applications it's important to remain DB-independent but also a lot of our code depends on being able to go directly from a result set to output. For example, we create HTML tables directly from the SQL in many cases. Not having access to the resultset metadata means having to hard code every column. It's not just that you have to set up variables of the Null variant to receive the data, you also have to describe the \u003ctd\u003e for each one and check for nulls on each column. You can't automate any of that anymore.\r\n\r\nSo we've decided to stay with Java (or C++) for now. I understand you can do some of this with interfaces but it doesn't seem to work with \"time\" results. \r\n\r\nPerhaps there is a way to write a layer on top of each DB driver to get the meta data, but doesn't it make sense for that to be part of the spec. After all, it is SQL we are talking about. It has a standard.",
