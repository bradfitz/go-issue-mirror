	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ntip\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nUbuntu 16.04\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\nTried to use go asm for ppc64x with a branch instruction based on a CR other than CR0.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nCorrect generated code.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\nIncorrect generated code.  The following is an example of an instruction that is accepted by the golang assembler without error but the generated ppc64x instruction encodes CR0 instead of CR2.\r\n\r\nBNE  CR2,label\r\n\r\nOther instructions like CMP which can set the CR will correctly accept other CRs and generate the correct ppc64x asm for them, e.g. CMP R2, R3, CR4.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
