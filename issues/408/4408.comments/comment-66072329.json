It's consistent\nwith where e.g. `imag` and `real` functions are listed. The placement is actually the\nresponsibility of godoc and there's IMO no reason to extend it by exceptional rules for\njust the (pseudo)package \"builtin\". Also, then someone could complain symmetrically why\n`len` and friends are not listed in the `int` section.\n\nSuggesting to close w/ \"works as intended\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
