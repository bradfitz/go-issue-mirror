It's simply not what go install -a means, and it is too late to change the\nmeaning.\n\nFor what it's worth, the go install -a behavior matches 'mk -a', or GNU make's make\n--always-make.\n\nPerhaps -a should stop at GOPATH boundaries, just like ordinary builds do.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-soon**, **go1.2**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
