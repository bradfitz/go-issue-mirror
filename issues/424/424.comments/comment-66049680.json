That seems\nreasonable.  Unfortunately, it appears that the runtime's\npc/line machinery is misinterpreting the table and getting\nthe line number wrong.  I checked it with a copy of acid\nhacked up to build against Go, and acid gets the line\nnumber right, so the binary is okay.\n\nChanging from CompilerBug to PackageBug.\n\nThe code is in src/pkg/runtime/symtab.go if anyone wants to have a look.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **packagebug**, removed **compilerbug**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **HelpWanted**._",
