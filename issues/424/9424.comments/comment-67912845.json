	"body": "Yes, if a func returns `error`, all we really _technically_ promise (and API check) is that it's either nil or it has an `Error() string` method.\r\n\r\nBut because we're so nice and care about compatibility, we also try pretty hard to not change the underlying type if it was exported in weekly-tagged release in 2010 and people are probably still relying on it somewhere. And sometimes we even add tests for such cases, especially if somebody asks if they can depend on it, or report that we broke them.\r\n\r\nStability sucks, I know.",
