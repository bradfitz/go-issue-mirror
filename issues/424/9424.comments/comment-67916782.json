	"body": "@davecheney It is not possible to use http.Client robustly without being able to check for (and retry) temporary errors, which are not part of the method's signature.  Unless you are proposing a broader refactoring to move the retry logic into the Client implementation, documenting errors is about the best we can do.\r\n\r\nI can understand not wanting to promise that http.Client returns only certain errors (e.g. only url.Error), but it should at least have some indication in that direction.  Without knowing to check for that and net.Error, one cannot implement anything resembling a reasonable caller-side retry loop.",
