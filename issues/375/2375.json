	"body": "by **jacobsa@google.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n1. Download the attached file.\n2. Run `6g panic.go \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 6l panic.6 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./6.out`.\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nThe panic should be printed and then recovered from, and the server should continue\nserving. I believe this is what happens when a panic happens in a regular old HTTP\nhandler.\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nSee attached. The panic is recovered from, and then there is another panic due to an\ninvalid memory address or nil pointer dereference.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nOS X 10.6.8\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?
