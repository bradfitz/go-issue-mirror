	"body": "Currently -bench output is very sensitive to GC effects. For example:\r\n\r\n  1. Changing allocations in phase A might cause a GC cycle to shift from phase B to phase C, which can look like an improvement to B and a regression for phase C.\r\n  2. Reducing long-lived memory pressure from earlier phases gets credited to later phases, as the later phases benefit from reduced GC costs.\r\n\r\nThis makes it hard to isolate performance improvements from frontend vs backend changes.\r\n\r\nI'm considering a few possible improvements to -bench:\r\n\r\n  1. Record GC pause times, and subtract them from phase times.\r\n  2. Record allocation stats for each phase.\r\n  3. Explicit GC cycle between FE and BE so we can measure how much live memory the FE has left for the BE to work with.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions and/or implementation advice?\r\n\r\n/cc @griesemer @rsc @aclements ",
