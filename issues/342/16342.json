	"body": "When writing code for compiler backends, we sometimes\r\nneed to manual create assembly instructions by initializing\r\n`cmd/internal/obj.Prog` structs directly. Even though\r\nthe revamped `Addr` types makes the task much easier than\r\nit was, the process is still very error-prone and any mistakes\r\nmade there is pretty hard to diagnose.\r\n\r\nI propose that we add an internal mode to cmd/asm that\r\ninstead of dumping .o object file, it prints the required\r\nProg initialization code to stdout.\r\n\r\nI first discussed this with @cherrymui and we both liked the\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the new mode should be able to accept instruction\r\neither from stdin, or better, from command line, so it is easier\r\nto use from within an editor. This mode might also serve as\r\ndocumentation for mapping instructions to Prog.\r\n\r\n/cc @robpike @randall77 @ianlancetaylor ",
