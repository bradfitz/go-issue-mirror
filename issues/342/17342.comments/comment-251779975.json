Only cases where both might be valid (for example, the `io.Reader` interface) should go out of their way to document something.\r\n\r\nBut... this thing is called `Read` like an `io.Reader`, so it invites some doubt.\r\n\r\nSo let's clarify. But the way we should clarify is that only one value is ever valid. I just haven't audited the code yet to verify that that's the case. Let's make it true if not.\r\n",
