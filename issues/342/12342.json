	"body": "pkix.Name.FillFromRDNSequence ignores attributes other than the first in the RDN sets passed as argument. As demonstrated by http://play.golang.org/p/GPZdVHzZVb, this in turn makes x509.ParseCertificate(s) fail to locate the subject serial number for certificates where it is included in  set containing the common name.\r\n\r\nThe fix is simple, also demonstrated by the playground program, but I'm unsure if the example certificate is broken and that multiple attributes in one RDN set should be ignored. And even if so, a workaround might still be desirable: The example certificate is issued by the national Danish ID provider, \"NemID\" mandatory for digital banking and digital public services.\r\n\r\nI raised the issue on golang-nuts:\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/1Whb4ko4zfc\r\n\r\nbut so far I've received no replies and so this issue serves as a reminder.",
