But there's no change to go/build that would make goimports just work with GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT, and in fact most or all the changes that would be required for goimports would be in x/tools/imports. (It could be made to work without any go/build changes, I think.)\r\n\r\nSo I suggest that either this issue be changed to be about goimports again, or we make a new bug to track the goimports changes.\r\n\r\nI sent an email to golang-dev to solicit more ideas about go/build.",
