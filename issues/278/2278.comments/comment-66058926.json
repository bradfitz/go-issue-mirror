Also,\nthe current behavior is inconsistent:\n\nSuppose we have a JSON object X = {\"foo\": null}. If we apply\njson.Marshal(json.Unmarshal(X)), the current implementation will produce {\"foo\": \"\"}.\nOops!\n\nI ran into this issue when using json.Marshal on goprotobuf-genereated types. Goprotobuf\nconsistently treats \"nil\" as missing field, while as json.Marshal generates empty string\nfrom it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
