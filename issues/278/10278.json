	"body": "On my windows machine (Windows 8.1 64-bit), the TestExtensionsByTypeMultiple test breaks consistently with the following error at tip:\r\n```\r\n--- FAIL: TestExtensionsByTypeMultiple (0.00s)\r\n        type_test.go:76: ExtensionsByType(\"text/html\") = [.htm .html .shtml]; want [.htm .html]\r\n```\r\nThis is likely the result of the MIME types map being made using data from the registry, and my system having an extra entry for text/html that the test wasn't expecting.\r\n\r\nI did not add the entry manually myself, so it's either a default for my version of the OS (compared to the builder's) or an addition made by a program I installed. Either case, the test should be probably be made more robust, or ignore the registry's mime-entries during testing.",
