I removed one of them (And found that I was setting the\nother in ~/.bash_profile). I removed GOROOT and GOBIN but kept GOPATH. \n\nThe complaint is 'fatal error: 'unicode/unistr.h' file not found'\n\nI managed to get around this by adding the correct path to my $PATH variable before, but\nit is not appeasing cgo. \n\nSince I can't really test the fix you gave me, I'll just take your word for it. Later,\nwhen I get a chance, I'll test this out on an OSX install with no prior go versions. \n\nThank you.\u003c/pre\u003e",
