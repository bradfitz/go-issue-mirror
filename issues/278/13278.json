	"body": "When we run godoc, it doesn't show any notification that the server has started, typically when I need godoc up and running I am in a middle of a programming crisis and only the doc can save me, but sadly it doesn't print when it is ready, I have to wait for some time or keep refreshing the page in my browser 100 times before it actually is started. So it would be great if we print this message before the call to HandleAndServe function, a way to notify that the server is up and running",
