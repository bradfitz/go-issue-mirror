The types_test.go tests are mixing testing the various functions and also testing parsing the OS-specific text files. Those need to be separate tests, and tests like `TestExtensionsByTypeMultiple` need to be testing just those functions on static data baked into the tests and not let OS-specific differences creep in.\r\n\r\n",
