So\nprobably just a documentation issue.\n\nBut even the net/http ResponseWriter contract doesn't say what the behavior is here, so\nI think the httptest.Recorder is more faithful: it records exactly what you did. No\nmagic recording.\n\nWe should document on both sides.\n\nSomewhat related: \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/8992\"\u003eissue #8992\u003c/a\u003e for omitting the Content-Type from handlers.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **documentation**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
