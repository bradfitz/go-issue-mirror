Googling around for the error from openssl (\"Verify return code: 21 (unable to verify the first certificate)\") is more helpful than the error from Go, as it leads to this: \r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/7587851/openssl-unable-to-verify-the-first-certificate-for-experian-url\r\n\r\nWhich suggests the problem is when the intermediate certificate isn't included in the bundle returned by the server web browsers will dynamically retrieve it/verify it, while crypto/x509 (and hence net/http) and openssl just give up.\r\n\r\nI'll take up the misconfiguration on the server I'm trying to access the sysadmins, but I still think this behaviour should be considered a bug in Go, since most developers will expect the certificate verification from net/http to validate in the same way as their web browser, curl, wget, etc.\r\n\r\n(Sorry to have hijacked your issue.)",
