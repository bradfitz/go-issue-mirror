And I can reproduce it on both windows and\nlinux.\n\nTrying to understand why it is happening. Here is the code:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/cmd/go/pkg.go#515\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/cmd/go/pkg.go#515\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIf you look at the comment just above:\n\n// ... If a package p is not in the same tree as any\n// package named on the command-line, assume it is up-to-date\n// no matter what the modification times on the source files indicate.\n// This avoids rebuilding $GOROOT packages when people are\n// working outside the Go root, and it effectively makes each tree\n// listed in $GOPATH a separate compilation world.\n// See \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/3149\"\u003eissue #3149\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nGiven that comment, in addition to extract from\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=a461bcce05f6\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=a461bcce05f6\u003c/a\u003e\n\ncommit message:\n\n* Do not recompile packages across roots (Fixes  \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/3149\"\u003eissue #3149\u003c/a\u003e .)\n\nI surmise it is working as intended. So I should be closing this issue as such. But, as\na fellow programer, I can see this behavior confusing in your scenario. Perhaps this\nneeds to be documented somewhere at the very least.\n\nLeaving it for others to decide what to do.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
