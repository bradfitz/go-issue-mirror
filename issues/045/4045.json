This makes sense since if Do returned anything else than the error I\nwould be forced to explicitly ignore the error (or handle it).\n\nI understand this could be very noisy for fmt.*, so that package may be completely\nblacklisted from the check. On the other hand, this feature could avoid some common\nerrors while using third party libs.\u003c/pre\u003e",
