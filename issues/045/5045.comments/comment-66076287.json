There are\nlots of practically useful things that are possible to build using atomics.\n\nSo what do you want to specify:\n1. Semantics for majority of simpler use cases (say 95%), and leave the remaining cases\nunspecified for now.\nor 2. Semantics for all practically useful cases.\n\nI would vote for 2, because sooner or later somebody will ask about the remaining 5% and\nanswer \"you can rely on X guarantee, but we do not want to officially guarantee it\" does\nnot look good. (btw we use that remaining 5% in e.g. WaitGroup).\nAnd 2 is extremely strong, it's not weak in any possible sense of this word.\u003c/pre\u003e",
