I guess my intuition failed me on that\nbecause reflection *knows* the underlying type so it is *possible* (but obviously not\nimplemented) to return a typed pointer to the underlying value of the interface{} value\nwhich would prevent another type being put into the interface{} value. \n\nSince there is no equivalent Go code for this reflection feature it is unlikely to be\never implemented. Thanks for the clarification.\u003c/pre\u003e",
