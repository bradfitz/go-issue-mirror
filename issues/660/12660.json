	"body": "I have a change to the gomobile tool that appears to make .app bundles produced with Xcode 7. It needs a bit more testing.\r\n\r\nThe gist of it is that the DevelopmentTeam ID needs to be in the project file. Unfortunately this requires a bit of machinery to detect, and I fear on complex setups we will have to guess which is the correct ID. We probably already were taking the first team ID, so that's not a new problem.",
