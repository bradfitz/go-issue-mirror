(See attached x.go)   It\nonly produces inconsistent results if it streams in and streams out, which the net/http\npackage (nor HTTP, really) permits.\n\nBut in this case, the md5 binary shouldn't produce any output until its input's EOF, so\nI think this should work.\n\nI suspected maybe that the exec package's io.Copy to the rw from its internal os.Pipe\nwas causing a 0-byte write or something which forced the HTTP package to shut down its\ninput, but that doesn't appear to be the case.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **suggested**._\n\n_Owner changed to @bradfitz._\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5660/2/x.go\"\u003ex.go\u003c/a\u003e (1225 bytes)",
