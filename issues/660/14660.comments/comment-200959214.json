	"body": "Maybe I haven't fully grasp the principle proposed here but I thought the whole \"parameter\" concept is to clarify that a context (at least under http.Request topic) is tightly coupled with the Request (and in general, a context should be coupled with its intended operation), that's it, it is a parameter along with the Request, and it will be invalid to use aftermath. The detach functionality is to make sure anything that still valid for the Request (e.g. user, creds, etc) are transferred into the new context but the time sensitive values (e.g. deadline, timeout duration, cancellation, etc) are not. \"Creating\" a brand new context for the async operation, not sure if it can work on all cases.",
