	"body": "@Thomasdezeeuw Thank you.\r\n\r\nBut the more important thing(I think) is, Does this pattern is the RIGHT practice of context.Context ?\r\n\r\nAs you see, the original context.Context is used as a nested structure and seems that each node is immutable(Please correct me if I misunderstand). the original common pattern is,\r\n```\r\nctx = context.WithValue(ctx, \"placeholder\", ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the pattern which I used is treat context.Context as a mutable object -- although it may has potential performance improvement.\r\nIt will encourage people use below code against context.Context\r\n```\r\nctx.Value(\"placeholder\").(*struct {}).Member1 = ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt smells bad. Hopefully could get comments from you and others.",
