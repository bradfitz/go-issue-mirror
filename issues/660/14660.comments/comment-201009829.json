	"body": "In my understanding, the context should be tightly coupled with its goroutine ideally, i.e. passed as a separate argument.\r\nIt will be clearer since that's more likely to be the idiomatic use elsewhere. ( A function that does part of its job asynchronously should accept a context.Context as argument).\r\n\r\nThe idea of creating a new top level context is to detach the cancellation signals. Indeed, any request specific values can be copied to the new context as values. That should not be a problem.\r\n\r\nIn fact, your example typically makes me realize that if the context is kept as a proper argument, things will be clearer.\r\n\r\nSince the http APIs are already frozen, the idea was to have a field on http.Request holding a context. If it is because a cancellation signal can be received from upstream then I guess yes, it is necessary. If it is just in order to pass a context.Context with or without a deadline/timeout, better use a proper context-aware wrapper around the API, imho.",
