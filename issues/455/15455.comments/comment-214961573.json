	"body": "@erikh, no, I did see your example. That's why I replied with the entry to the FAQ. The docs say the body can be nil, but the body argument to NewRequest is an interface, so that means it has to be a nil interface value. You put a nil concrete type (*bytes.Buffer) into an interface value on line 14 of your https://play.golang.org/p/kaLpNTYIEm (where you commented `// panics!! but why?`), resulting in a non-nil interface value. This is where you violated the contract of the documentation.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen you around the Go community before, so I assumed you were still learning Go. My apologies if that's not the case. In any case, we're all still learning. After 6+ years with Go, I still find new things about it.",
