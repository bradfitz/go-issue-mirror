(from APNIC region ;)  but pretty interesting, is that common in ARIN/RIPE\nregions recently?\n\nWell, the primary incentive *should* be to preserve the Internet as a platform of\nfreedom and innovation, but for a hypothetical ISP who only cares about cost, IPv6 makes\nmore sense if you know that you won't have to keep scaling up your IPv4 NAT\ninfrastructure forever.\n\nThat said, I don't personally know what the operators are thinking.\u003c/pre\u003e",
