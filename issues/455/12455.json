	"title": "net/http: consider reusing buffers replacing io.Copy calls with io.CopyBuffer",
	"body": "As been shown in #12450 by crude patch to make io.Copy reuse its underlying 32k buffer(s) workloads intensively (ab)using net/http can see a significant reduce in GC pressure. Since changes to io.Copy has [already been proposed and rejected](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/5509), I'd like to discuss the prospect of replacing at least some of the io.Copy calls in net/http by io.CopyBuffer with reused byte slices.\r\n\r\nThe net/http uses io.Copy the most in standard library, and I believe updating it to use recently introduced io.CopyBuffer is worth doing.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo (master) $ find src/net/http -name \\*.go -type f ! -name \\*_test.go -exec cat '{}' \\+ | grep -wc io.Copy\r\n19\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt least some of those calls are not subject to usual io.ReaderFrom/io.WriterTo optimizations.\r\n\r\nI'm ready to implement changes in the upcoming days and propose a CL.",
