It's especially confusing because it happens seemingly randomly, and the most recent code doesn't import any cgo code, although I do have \"export CGO_LDFLAGS=\"-L/Users/brendan/software/OpenBLAS -lopenblas\" in my .bash_profile.  I'd like to be more helpful, but I don't know how to make a consistent reproducer. I think I've only seen it when using \"go run\" if that has any relevance.",
