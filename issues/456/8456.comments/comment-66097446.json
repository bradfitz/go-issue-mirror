As 0xjnml says, any such test is\nnormally racy, because if you make any decision based on whether the file exists, the\nfile may have been created or deleted by some entirely independent process by the time\nyou execute that decision.  What you need are operations like \"create this file, but\nonly if it does not exist\" (which is done by using os.OpenFile with O_CREATE|O_EXCL).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Invalid**._",
