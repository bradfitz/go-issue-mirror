To my mind it really has nothing\nto do with Go, it has to do with the nature of multi-process machines.  Writing a\nprogram that assumes that it can test whether a file exists can be a security issue, but\nthat too has nothing to do with Go.\n\nIt's fine to use os.Stat for the very rare cases where it's OK to simply test whether a\nfile exists.  That doesn't mean that we should document it as such.\u003c/pre\u003e",
