A negative \nindex or size is nonsensical and only needed if overloading with an error \nindicator (e.g. -1) (a situation which I had the impression that Go was \nseeking to avoid).\n\nChange return type from int to uint (or appropriate arg in tuple):\n   string.Count\n   utf8.DecodeRune\n   utf8.DecodeRuneInString\n   utf8.EncodeRune\n   utf8.RuneCount\n   utf8.RuneCountInString\n   uff8.RuneLen\n\nChange return type from int to (uint, bool):\n   string.Index\n   string.LastIndex\n\nChange one or more arguments:\n   string.Repeat\n   string.Split\n   string.SplitAfter\n\nOther changes:\n   string.Map should modify the first arg mapping) to return (uint, bool)\n\nIt may also be appropriate to change rune type from int to uint in utf8 \nand unicode packages.\n\nI can appreciate that this will cause significant ripple effect; if this \nchange is approved it's better to get it adjusted as early as possible.\u003c/pre\u003e",
