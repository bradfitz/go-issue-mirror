	"body": "I understand your concern.  The (reflect.Value).Pointer method seems to suggest that a map value is just a pointer, but it's not clear what it actually commits us to.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the language provided a reliable and portable way for programs to detect cycles in arbitrary object graphs.  This requires a robust notion of identity for maps, channels, functions, and slices.  (reflect.Value).Pointer + unsafe.Pointer is sufficient for the first three; slices require runtime.SliceHeader + unsafePointer, which is not portable.",
