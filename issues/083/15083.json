	"body": "Downloaded Go 1.6 and ran `go tool tour`. Nicely done!\r\n\r\nFound one small issue. On slide `moretypes/16` it says:\r\n\r\n\"Maps must be created with make before use; the nil map is empty and cannot be assigned to.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not completely accurate. The second part is true. However, the first part is not. I can create a map by assigning it from a map literal, and use it, without ever invoking `make`. \r\n\r\nFor example, from the very next slide:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar m = map[string]Vertex{\r\n\t\"Bell Labs\": Vertex{\r\n\t\t40.68433, -74.39967,\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"Google\": Vertex{\r\n\t\t37.42202, -122.08408,\r\n\t},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand I can use this map, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tm[\"Somewhere\"] = Vertex{42.2, 43.3}\r\n\tfmt.Println(m)\r\n```",
