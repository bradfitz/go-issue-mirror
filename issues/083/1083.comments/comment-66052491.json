It's calling into the old \"stat\" syscall, not\nthe new \"stat64\" syscall.  And worse, it's using the stat64 struct stat layout with the\n32-bit call.\n\nSee linux-2.6/arch/arm/include/asm/stat.h for details.\n\nWork-around fix:\n\ngo/src/pkg/syscall/zsyscall_linux_arm.go -- change func Stat's use of SYS_STAT to\nSYS_STAT64.\n\nProbably also the case with LSTAT64 and STATFS64 too, but unverified.\u003c/pre\u003e",
