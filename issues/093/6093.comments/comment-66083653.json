I tried sending a message from the server to the\nclient that was more than 1500 bytes long. This caused it to get broken up into multiple\nEthernet packets, which I received on the client one at a time. Again, I have no way of\nknowing to reconstitute these pieces. I suppose I could add my own framing, but I\nthought WebSocket was supposed to do that for me.\u003c/pre\u003e",
