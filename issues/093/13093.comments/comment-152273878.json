We must heap allocate if the value either escapes or is variable sized.  go1.4 is correct in saying buf does not escape.\r\n\r\nDoes escape analysis in 1.5 mark variable-sized allocations as escaping?  That's not technically correct, but it's academic at this point because it will get heap allocated either way.  But it may matter at some point in the future (per-goroutine private heaps?  Function-local alias analysis?)",
