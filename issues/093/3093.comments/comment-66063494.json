I think the problem is that we use CreateProcess windows API with\nlpApplicationName == nil and lpCommandLine == \"hg ...\". This combination invokes this\nrule:\n\n\"... the first white spaceâ€“delimited token of the command line specifies the module\nname. ... If the file name does not contain an extension, .exe is appended. Therefore,\nif the file name extension is .com, this parameter must include the .com extension. ...\"\n(\u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/m24Rh)\"\u003ehttp://goo.gl/m24Rh)\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nSo, it is not even trying to look for hg.bat.\n\nWe can add another call to CreateProcess(\"hg.bat\") if CreateProcess(\"hg\") fails. But I\nam reluctant to deal with batch files altogether. Given our experience with all.bat, how\nare we going to know if hg runs to successful completion?\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-windows**._\n\n_Owner changed to @alexbrainman._\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
