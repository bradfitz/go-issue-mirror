This sort of stuff's been on my mind but I hadn't gotten around\nto it or filed specific bugs, so glad there is one now.\n\nIt is better than it used to be, though... we used to not even have read/write timeouts,\nor a Server struct to hang new options off of.  :)\n\nI run a public webserver with Go's http package so I'm quite motivated to fix this all.\n\nFeel free to add related stuff to this bug.\u003c/pre\u003e",
