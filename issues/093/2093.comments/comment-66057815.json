Much appreciated!\n\nAs for the handler enforcing a limit on the body, are you imagining that\nrequest.Body.Reader would be wrapped within the handler by an\nio.LimitReader?\n\nIf so, could you make the http.body struct be public, i.e. http.Body. Then\na handler could turn the request.Body ReadCloser into an http.Body and\nwrap/modify the Body.Reader...\n\nOr were you imagining something else?\n\n-- \nThanks again, tav\u003c/pre\u003e",
