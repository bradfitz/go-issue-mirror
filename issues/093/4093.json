Documentation for built-in rune type is incorrect:\n\nFrom go/src/pkg/builtin/builtin.go (Lines 85-87)\n\n// rune is an alias for int and is equivalent to int in all ways. It // used, by\nconvention, to distinguish character values from integer // In a future version of Go,\nit will change to an alias of int32.\ntype rune rune\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nrune is already an alias of int32\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nIn a future version of Go, it will change to an alias of int32.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux\n\nWhich version are you using?
