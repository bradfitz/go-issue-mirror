	"body": "On-disk pprof profiles are defined to be gzipped, never ungzipped. We were very clear about this when we wrote the spec for them. If pprof accepts ungzipped, that's arguably a bug in pprof. Go should only ever generate the gzipped form.\n\nThat said, I don't think putting a gzip dependency in runtime/pprof is too big a problem: runtime/pprof (the package you import to actually get the profiles out of the runtime) is not a low-level package. I would be concerned if runtime itself grew a gzip dependency, but runtime/pprof is OK.",
