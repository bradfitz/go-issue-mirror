	"body": "I propose to add a function\r\n    `func runtime/pprof.StartCPUProfileProto(w io.Writer) error`\r\nand support in the runtime, for generating profiles in gzip-compressed serialized profile protocol buffers, rather than in the legacy pprof format.\r\n\r\nThe profile proto is more extensible than the legacy pprof format and is pprof's preferred profile format. The extensibility will be useful to support generating profiles with labels. pprof supports rendering labeled profiles, but labels can only appear in the proto profile, not in the legacy format.\r\n\r\nThe gzipped profile proto format is already understood by pprof itself and pprof already includes an encoder for producing serialized profile protos without requiring a dependency on the proto package or library.\r\n\r\nHere's the pprof proto description: https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/proto/profile.proto\r\nand here's the encoder: https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/profile/proto.go\r\nFor more about labels, take a look at the https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/doc/developer/profile.proto.md#labels",
