It's pretty fast.  Still needs more testing\nand 386/arm implementations.\n\nAs an aside, it would be nice to have an easy way of writing a single function in\nassembly for one arch and c (or go) for another arch.  Right now it is an\nall-arch-or-no-arch conversion from c to assembly.  I think you could hack it up with\n+build tags but it would require a lot of files.  Maybe per-function +build pragmas?\u003c/pre\u003e",
