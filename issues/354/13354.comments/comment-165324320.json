	"body": "I can reproduce this using Go 1.5. A quicker fix is to run `go build -i -a`. In general, `go build -i -a` rebuilds and installs all dependencies of the current package, whether or not they need it. When you add `-gcflags '-N -l'` it rebuilds everything, including the standard library, and installs one that is no longer linkable into any actual program. That's bad, of course, but it doesn't break the go command, so rerunning the command without the `-gcflags` puts everything back.\r\n\r\nI cannot reproduce this using the current dev branch, likely because we raised the stack limits again. \r\n\r\nThere's a real problem here but likely not high enough priority for Go 1.6, given both the easy workaround and the fact that it's not happening anymore.\r\n\r\n",
