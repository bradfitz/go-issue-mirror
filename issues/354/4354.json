Try to compile 6g or 8g on ARM, e.g. 'GOARCH=386 ./all.bash'\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nA success banner after everything finishes compiling\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nAfter a line reading 'pkg/runtime (linux/386)', there is a bunch of type/func/var/const\ndeclarations and an error that says 'go tool dist: FAILED:\n/home/me/.local/go/pkg/tool/linux_arm/8c -DGOOS_linux -DGOARCH_386\n-I/var/tmp/go-cbuild-yASbc9 -q iface.c'.\n\nI can provide the full output but it's pretty huge and, as far as I can tell, I've\ndescribed everything that's relevant.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nN/A\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux\n\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version devel +fd3746c787ac Tue Nov 06 12:09:40 2012 +0400\u003c/pre\u003e",
