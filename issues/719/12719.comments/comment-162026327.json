The parser is a bit lax in accepting the UTF-8 to begin with, but it's probably a mistake to reject it at this point.\r\n\r\nI sent a CL to accept the %-encoded form so that we can round-trip the URL. I'm not sure this is a great idea, but we'll see I guess. The main argument is for non-HTTP uses of URLs.\r\n\r\n",
