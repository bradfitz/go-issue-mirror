I have merged your two previous issues into this\none as I believe they are the same problem.\n\nI understand that is it frustrating that you are blocked on your work, but please\nremember that Go is an open source project and many of the people who contribute to Go\ndo so on a volunteer basis. \n\nI am marking this issue as Accepted but it will require someone who understands cgo and\ngdb to investigate further. I cannot make any promises when this issue will be looked at\nor resolved, but I do ask that you refrain from raising more issues about this problem\nas it will not bring a resolution any sooner.\n\nMany thanks\n\nDave Cheney\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
