If we really wanted, we could have a `go XXX` subcommand to free up disk space, if that's the concern. \r\n\r\nGreat to hear that `gb` does caching for both build and install!\r\n\r\nIf we get to the point where the current \"pkg\" is just a cache and also cached `go build`, that's great, but then my next annoyance is that I have to look at it. I like to set my $GOPATH to $HOME, and that means I have $HOME/pkg being a useless turd right in my home directory.  So I'd rather put things in the right spots:\r\n* For Linux etc we have stuff like http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html for the user-specific cache directory.\r\n* OS X has $HOME/Library/Caches\r\n* Windows has %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp (aka $TMP aka $TEMP) (from http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749104(v=ws.10).aspx\r\n\r\n",
