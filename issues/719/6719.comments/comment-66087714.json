I've had too many annoying experiences where\nsomebody reports that a test works with gc but not with gccgo, only to discover that\nit's because they were unknowingly relying on a consistent map order.\n\nI agree it's not the most important issue, especially if you don't use gccgo, but I\nthink it would be cheap and it would address a problem, so why not?\u003c/pre\u003e",
