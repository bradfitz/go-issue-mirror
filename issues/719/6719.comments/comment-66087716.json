It turned out to be a good move, as it exposed a lot of\npoorly-written tests (and who knows how much buggy code existed before then).\n\nHas that reasoning changed? I don't think so. Will this have a performance impact on map\niteration of small maps? I doubt that very much.\n\nThis isn't like the uint8 change. That change was to improve performance in a very minor\ncase. This is a change to improve code quality, and a change for which there is\nprecedent and documented benefits.\u003c/pre\u003e",
