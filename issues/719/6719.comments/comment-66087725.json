The code had\nbeen reviewed and I was about to submit when I accidentally noticed the problem, which\nwould have broken our trunk when run with gccgo.\n\nI'd say it's definitely worth fixing this.\n\nFWIW map iteration order is not exactly random with \u003e8 elements either - when there are\n9 elements, I see only two possible iteration orders: [2 3 4 7 8 0 1 5 6] and [0 1 5 6 2\n3 4 7 8].\u003c/pre\u003e",
