	"body": "On go version go1.5.1 linux/amd64, the first line of `go get --help` is: `usage: get [-d] [-f] [-fix] [-insecure] [-t] [-u] [build flags] [packages]` which doesn't mention the `-v` flag, even though it does work, and so should be documented. The function of `-v` appears to be to make the output more verbose.\r\n\r\nThis was originally reported by @epitron, here https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12197#issuecomment-196019906 -- but no-one seems to have made the requested separate bug till now.",
