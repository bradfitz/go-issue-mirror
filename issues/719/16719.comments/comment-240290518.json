I'm not sure I fully agree with documenting the flag both in the list of build flags, *and* in the detailed list on `go get` (but not on `clean`, `install`, `list`, `run` or `test`) -- but since this bug is now closed, I guess that's another issue, and one I don't feel like opening. :-/ \r\n\r\nI think documenting the list of build flags in each of the commands that accept them, and referring to `go help build` for the detailed descriptions, would be better. But, like you said, \"docs are hard\".",
