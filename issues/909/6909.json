	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. run `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\ncoverage.out contains coverage all of the specified packages\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n`cannot use test profile flag with multiple packages`\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nOS X 10.9\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo version go1.2 darwin/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nIf I manually construct a coverage.out file from multiple packages, it seems to work\nfine:\n\n1. go test -coverprofile a.part ./a\n2. go test -coverprofile b.part ./b\n3. echo \u0026quot;mode: set\u0026quot; \u0026gt;coverage.out\n4. grep -h -v \u0026quot;mode: set\u0026quot; *.part \u0026gt;\u0026gt;coverage.out\n5. go tool cover -html=coverage.out\n\nWhy can't `go test -coverprofile` do this automatically?\u003c/pre\u003e",
