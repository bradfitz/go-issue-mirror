So `project` tests are also covering the subpackages. \r\n\r\nI think the output of -cover with -coverpkg provides the right figure for this sort of coverage. The problem is that it cannot output a profile along with it too.\r\n\r\nMerging independent coverage profiles is not addressing the real issue (but it's nice to have).",
