Types are necessary: to resolve embedded interfaces, to typecheck signatures, to check equality of interface types. The current parser assumes a particular order in export data which is no longer satisfied after patching.\n\n * things must be correctly exported to make sure the binary does not end up with two type definitions and names for identical interface types: a program may compile fine but fail at runtime because conversion to interface is lost in method tables\u003c/pre\u003e",
