The major change is that scanning of Go stack frames is now completely precise. \nThere are lots of minor changes, including scanning interfaces precisely, correct\ncontext pointer scanning, and modifying reflect.Value to do its magic in a precise way.\n\nWe're not completely precise yet, but we're 99% there.  The major remaining piece is the\nscanning of C stack frames.  A few minor pieces also remain, including scanning of some\nruntime internal data structures.\u003c/pre\u003e",
