C stack frames are gone, and the internal\ndata structures are described correctly now. The only piece I am aware of that is left\nare a few C-declared data structures that the linker instructs the garbage collector to\nscan conservatively. I think we can eliminate those for 1.4 and finally close this bug.\n\nThere is one other piece that I am not counting: if you use SWIG to allocate Go memory\nfrom C++, that Go memory is scanned conservatively. That's a different problem (issue\n6461) and not a concern for most Go programmers (since most don't use SWIG).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.4**, removed **release-none**._",
