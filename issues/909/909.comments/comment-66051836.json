I understand this is a rather complex issue, and I\nappreciate that you're working to fix it.\n\nTo paraphrase, what I'm hearing is --\n\n1. \"You can write syntactically correct Go code, and it will mostly likely work, but\nthere's a small chance it will leak memory.\"\n\n2. \"If your code is going to leak memory, you won't know ahead of time; you'll have to\nmonitor the code while it runs. It will be a major pain to detect and figure out where\nit's leaking, and the only fix is an awkward work-around.\"\n\nAre those fair?\n\nI need Go to run unattended for a long time in a high-reliability production deployment.\nThis issue has turned me off to using Go. I'm very excited to give Go a go when the GC\nis completely precise.\u003c/pre\u003e",
