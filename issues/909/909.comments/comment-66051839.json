If this is true then I'm a lot less concerned. Would you explain how\nthis can be the case? I don't have a good understanding of how GCs or memory management\nwork. If my process has a lot of data-structure churn, won't the leaked memory gradually\naccumulate? If memory is leaked, how would it ever get reclaimed by the GC? What\nprevents the accumulation of leaked memory?\u003c/pre\u003e",
