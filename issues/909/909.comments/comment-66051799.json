My\nold buffer.Reset() becomes buffer.Seek(0, 0), but apart from that, coffer was a drop-in\nreplacement in my case. Note that buffer.Close() free()s the memory and *needs* to be\ncalled.\n\nThis is not a beautiful solution, but it gets the job done until this problem is\nproperly fixed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
