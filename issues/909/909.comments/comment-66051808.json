That's what I did in the CL described by\ncomment #20.\n\nBut that's not enough.  All it takes is one unfortunate collision to pin a\npointer in memory that should not be, and that might be the root of some\nlarge tree of allocations.  The chance of collision increases the more\nmemory you allocate, since more and more 32-bit patterns point into\nallocated data.\n\nThe collector is structured so that it can keep per-word information about\nwhat is a pointer and what is not, but we have not hooked that up to the\nC compiler and the Go compiler yet, so we can't take advantage of that.\n\nIt is a known, unfortunate issue.\nThe best workaround I can suggest for the short term is to use a 64-bit machine.\n\nSorry.\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
