Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. run test.go with the sdl bindings i attached, sdl version i used is 1.2.14\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nshould print \u0026quot;test\u0026quot; periodically if all works ok.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nSlackware Linux 64 bit version\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n43cf9b39b647 weekly/weekly.2012-02-14\nusing go amd64\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI think this is a threading problem, since using pthreads also leads to segfault. when I\ntry to do stuff like pthread_join on a c thread that calls a go function.\n\nI've attached my SDL bindings for SDL 1.2.14 and \na sample go code that receives signal 11\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3068/0/sdl.tar.gz\"\u003esdl.tar.gz\u003c/a\u003e (7419 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3068/0/test.go\"\u003etest.go\u003c/a\u003e (406 bytes)",
