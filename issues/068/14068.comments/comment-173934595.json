	"body": "@TocarIP thanks for the comments. I agree about HD following the\nestablished pattern for a general move; it's really the follow-on effects\non the other VEX instructions that are the problem. Even so I think I will\nrename the HD move too. If we want a generic 16-byte move alias I am\ninclined to just call them MOV16U and MOV16A. I've been meaning to make\ncommon aliases MOV1, MOV2, MOV4, MOV8 across all the systems anyway (right\nnow there are inconsistencies, like MOVW means 4 bytes on ARM but 2 bytes\non x86). But I'll leave that for Go 1.7.\n\nIn general I am leaning toward making the Go assembly match GNU assembler\nas much as possible in the SSE, AVX, and other extensions, for exactly the\nreasons you mentioned. So I'll add the Y registers now, make both forms of\nthe VEX instructions available, and queue further cleanup for Go 1.7. (I'm\ngoing to leave the integer instructions alone, we'll keep having AX instead\nof AX/EAX/RAX and so on.)\n\nThanks again.\n",
