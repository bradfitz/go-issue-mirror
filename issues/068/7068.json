It says:\n\nprog.go:9: invalid operation: this[i] (index of type *foo)\n\nwhich doesn't make sense when reading the code to try to spot the error, since it would\nappear that the index is indeed of type int, not type *foo.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nprog.go:9: invalid index operation: this is not a map type\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nprog.go:9: invalid operation: this[i] (index of type *foo)\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nlinux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo version go1.2 linux/amd64\u003c/pre\u003e",
