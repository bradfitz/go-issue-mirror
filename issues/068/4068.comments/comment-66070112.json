It doesn't really\nseem to gel with the rest of the standard library packages, to me.\n\nI'm not trying to poo-poo it or anything, it seems like it would be quite useful.\nHowever, in the interests of fighting complexity it would seem like a bit of a sore\nthumb in the standard library.\n\nAs a sort of side-point to this, why isn't there a \"contrib\" set of packages? It seems\nlike this would be perfect for a quasi-sanctioned contrib package.\n\nJust my $0.02. I know that one of the biggest draws for me to Go is it's incredibly\nconsistent standard library, having yet more packages worries me about increasing\nentropy.\n\nRegards,\nAaron\u003c/pre\u003e",
