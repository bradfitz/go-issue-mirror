The net package for example, you don't write apps that do epoll on\nlinux, kevent/kqueue on OSX/BSD and winsock on Windows, you write against net. I concede\nmy interface may not be optimal, I just went with whatever exp/inotify was doing, but\nproviding every available os-specific mask for each OS does not exactly encourage\nportability.\n\nThe goal I had in mind is that you could write against fsnotify on linux, copy your\nsource tree to windows, build and not have to change anything. In order to do that I did\nhave to impose some limitations to attempt consistency across operating systems.\u003c/pre\u003e",
