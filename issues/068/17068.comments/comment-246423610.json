When I was using DynlinkingGo, I was tripping the other condition for host linking without realizing, so all of my original poking around the output for the right relocations was done on a host linked binary. Then I changed it so I don't host link, but by that point I was just testing all my binaries worked, and my linux system is far too forgiving. So I have a bunch more code to write to generate all the appropriate relocations.\r\n\r\nI'll send a CL disabling internal PIE for now, as this may take a few days.",
