	"body": "@bioothod, thanks for the heap dumps. I'm not sure why your top10s are reporting deferproc and _Cfunc_session_get_routes; those don't appear anywhere as allocation sites in the raw heap dumps files. Are you sure you ran pprof with the same binary that generated each profile?\r\n\r\nFrom the raw heap dumps, it's clear that the vast majority of your memory in both cases is coming from 10MB allocations at github.com/bioothod/elliptics-go/elliptics.NewReadSeekerKeyOffsetSize (github.com/bioothod/elliptics-go/elliptics/reader.go:89). What's not clear is why there are far more of those sticking around in Go 1.6 than there were in Go 1.5.3. What happens with the ReadSeeker constructed there?\r\n\r\n@randall77, would it be possible to use the heap dumper to figure out why this allocation is being retained in 1.6 and not in 1.5.3?",
