I'd say it happens once or week or so. \n\nDoing a google search for 'site:build.golang.org \u0026quot;wait: bad address\u0026quot;' shows\ntwo failed builds on the official Go buildbot with the same error both on FreeBSD/amd64.\n\nI have no idea what is going on here, but I'm filing the issue in the event someone has\nan idea how to track this down.\u003c/pre\u003e",
