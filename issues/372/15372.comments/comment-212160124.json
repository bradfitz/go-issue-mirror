	"body": "The compiler and the runtime package are closely tied together, in the sense that there are CL ranges (C1,C2) where if the compiler is in that range the runtime must also be in that range.  The go tool rebuilds the runtime when the source code changes, but it does not rebuild the compiler.  So it's easy for the runtime to be in one range and the compiler in another.  Usually this causes a failure to link, which is an obvious failure mode.  @crawshaw 's recent changes cause a failure to run.\r\n\r\nI can imagine a couple of ways to fix this, but they all have costs.  The problem only affects very active developers.  If there is a fairly cheap fix, we should implement it.  Otherwise I'm not sure it's worth it.",
