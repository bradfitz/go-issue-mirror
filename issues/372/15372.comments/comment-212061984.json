If that's all this is, I expect it to stop when I stop making type data changes in a couple of weeks. (There are more I could make next cycle, but I'd have to find a pressing need for the changes.) If it's something more than that, I can take a look if you can give me instructions on how to reproduce this.\r\n\r\nIf you want a general-purpose solution we could have the compiler check that it is in sync with its GOROOT. But that would mess with my personal workflow where I let them drift deliberately to experiment quickly, so I'm not keen on that.\r\n\r\nUnassigning myself, because I don't think there's anything specific to my work to fix this (except stopping), and I can't see a general fix.",
