	"body": "Alright, I must confess I should not have been expecting it to behave like a shell, since it does not make so much sense indeed. But still, here is what I was expecting, I think : \r\nWhen calling for example `/bin/ls` with `\"-l \"` as argument -- remark the space at the end --, instead of just an \"exit status 2\" error, I would expect it to output the error as `/bin/ls` does : \r\n`/bin/ls: invalid option -- ' '`\r\n\r\nBut then I realized that `.CombinedOutput()` is doing exactly this, so I guess I should use CombinedOutput when doing debugging, it would have saved me hours. Hope someone will find this post helpful once.\r\n\r\nIn the end, effectively the only thing I missed documentation-wise, was an explicit mention of `Output()` ignoring the Stderr in case of errors. But I won't argue it is necessary in the documentation.\r\n\r\nSorry for bothering you and many thanks Brad!\r\n",
