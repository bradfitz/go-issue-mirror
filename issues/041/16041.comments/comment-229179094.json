If step 3 happens (the RoundTrip failed), the cancellation code to close the TCP connection should've already been unregistered.\r\n\r\nIn any case, more details as requested by @adg and @dpiddy would be nice. How can we reproduce this? What do the requests look like? How are the 10% of requests being canceled? I'd like to help if I can see it fail.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nFor now, kicking to Go 1.8, unless you can get back to us soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
