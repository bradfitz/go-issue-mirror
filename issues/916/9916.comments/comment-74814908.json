From what I can tell it bypasses uuid.dll entirely and includes the GUIDs in the binary... in which case I'm not sure if this counts as a fix because I don't know if some other thing could cause this specific problem.\r\n\r\nI don't need to use COM from Go; I wrote a new Table control for package ui and its accessibility code uses COM (as that's how accessibility is exposed on Windows) but that's all on the C side.",
