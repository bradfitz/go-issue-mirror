How can you create a scalar float value without \r\na) specifying the type with var, or b) using a constant with :=?\r\n\r\nAfter playing with it, I discovered that there are no `float` or `complex` basic types, and I understand why. Ah Ha! That's what the FAQ is saying. I missed the \", etc.\" OK, for me, the confusion would not have occurred with the following wording:\r\n\r\n\u003e \r\nOn the other hand, there is no `float` or `complex` type: you must always choose a size. Programmers should always be aware of precision when using floating point numbers. The default size of a floating point constant is `float64`, so `foo := 3.0` will create foo with type `float64` and `bar := 3+2i` will create `bar` with type `complex128`. If you want `float32` or `complex64`, you will have to explicitly say so. e.g. `var f1 float32`.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would suggest making this a separate paragraph from the `int` part that precedes it.\r\n",
