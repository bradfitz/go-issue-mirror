For simplicity's sake, it makes sense to me to provide a single `golang` package, which is more or less equivalent to untarring to `/usr/local/go` and updating `PATH`.\r\n\r\nThe major downside of this is that some users will get more than they want or need. For instance, everyone on amd64 would get the race-detector-enabled runtime and standard library. But to me that doesn't seem a significant drawback.\r\n\r\n@mwhudson, @jfrazelle what do you think about this?",
