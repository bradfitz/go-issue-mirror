I made a silly shell script to help making a deb from git tip: http://paste.ubuntu.com/14677806/ but I guess that's not really what you are talking about?\r\n\r\nDebian maintains their packaging in git http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-golang/golang.git and uses git-buildpackage to update to a new upstream version.\r\n\r\nFor adding the functionality to x/build/cmd/release I guess the question would be \"where do you get the debian directory from?\". I suppose it could just be embedded into cmd/release. It would be nice to coordinate between any official Google debs and Ubuntu and Debian, but I guess I can just submit CLs/PRs/patches to wherever you end up pulling the packaging bits from :-)",
