People have reported skimming and seeing\nonly the date(1)-format line and missing the important note about 1-2-3.\n\nAlso it would be nice if the format could be moved somewhere that is easier\nto find with godoc.  When I need to remind myself what the date is, I never\nknow what to ask godoc for inside package time, and I end up skimming through\nthe whole 'godoc time' output.  Maybe 'godoc time Parse'?\u003c/pre\u003e",
