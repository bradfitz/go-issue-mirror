	"title": "net/http/httptrace: Add TLS handshake timing information",
	"body": "httptrace currently does not offer a way to measure the TLS handshake of a request when using https. This might be trivial to implement in [net/http/transport.dialConn](https://golang.org/src/net/http/transport.go#L1012) by adding a few more callbacks in httptrace. I suggest `TLSHandshakeStart` and `TLSHandshakeDone` . \r\n\r\nA hacky solution I am considering for now is to use `ConnectDone` as a proxy for `TLSHandshakeStart` and `WroteRequest` as a proxy for `TLSHandshakeDone`, but its better to have the real measurements.\r\n\r\nPS: Thanks a lot for httptrace. I am now removing lots of ugly hacks from my project and letting the standard library do its thing.",
