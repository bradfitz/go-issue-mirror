	"body": "No official updates, just some experiments to fix this the right way. By traversing interesting statements such as function calls, assignments, declarations, etc, the connectivity of the objects in each function is easier to discover. The current approach looks at every variable and then uses the information gained from the dataflow analysis to similarly find calls, assignments, etc. It is also imprecise about field accesses which makes the analysis conservative in many places where it should not be.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm trying to get the analysis working without the current dataflow analysis. Afterwards, I will be focusing on the precision of the algorithm to make sure nothing in the stdlib fails.",
