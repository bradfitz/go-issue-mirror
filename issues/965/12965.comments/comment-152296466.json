	"body": "That sounds correct. These runtime errors will be due to the analysis marking variables as non-escaping and using a stack address where there should have been a heap address. With the patch in mind, it is likely that there are two indistinguishable variables which should share the same escape information and it leads to one being marked as non-escaping incorrectly. If you find reproducers, it would be very useful in helping me fine-tune this algorithm and we can put them in the testsuite to check for future regressions. Thanks again.",
