	"body": "Thanks for the extra information. I suppose I should say this is a long-standing problem I encountered when implementing escape analysis. The dataflow class was not being used previously, and I stole it for the purposes of escape analysis. The implementation is already not up-to-date and using it with escape analysis puts pressure on those fragile parts. I plan to clean up the majority of the escape analysis code to make it fit the code around it in the following months.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, is there a particular project that you need escape analysis in gccgo for (that you can mention)? If so, I'd like to work with you to make sure the implementation fits your needs. It is 100% untested in the wild and the results within the stdlib are inconclusive. I'd like those last two statements to be incorrect in the near future.",
