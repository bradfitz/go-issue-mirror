Say you want normal distributed numbers.\nUsually, you'd take uniform distributed numbers and convert them. The current approach\nwould skews the tails.\n\nWhen you say the current approach is more uniform, it may well be - but not in a \"fair\"\nway. AFAIK regular spacing beats higher resolution near zero - at least for simulations\nit is less surprising and more fair, which is a good thing.\u003c/pre\u003e",
