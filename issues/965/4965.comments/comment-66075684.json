The result of rand.Floatxx is certainly not uniformly distributed over a\ndiscrete set of floating-point numbers, and there is no point into doing that unless you\nhave a particular reason.\n\nHowever, it is certainly a good approximation of the continuous uniform distribution\nover [0,1]. If you think it is not the case, please show a problem that has a good\nreason to use rand.Floatxx, that is not correctly addressed by the current\nimplementation, and would be better solved by your more complicated proposal.\n\nPeople who want samples of a discrete distribution should definitely use integers, not\nfloating-point numbers.\u003c/pre\u003e",
