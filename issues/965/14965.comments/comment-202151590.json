However errorString's Error() method prefixes `runtime error: ` before every message.\r\nThis will mean that the panics that will now be fixed e.g originally \"assignment to entry in nil map\" will now be \"runtime error: assignment to entry in nil map\". If this is deemed as not a compatibility problem, since this code has been in the stdlib for a while since July 2014\r\n\u003cimg width=\"748\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-03-27 at 2 45 17 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4898263/14068004/c98854bc-f42a-11e5-819a-e871a6a8d8ee.png\"\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\nI can spin up a CL to fix this.",
