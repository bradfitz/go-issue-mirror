	"body": "by **nicolas.b.pierron**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIn C: You have an allocation (malloc, ...) and a deallocation (free).\nIn C++: You have an allocation (new) and a deallocation (delete).\n\nIf you remove the deallocation from the view of the user, why are you keeping the\nallocation?  \nFrom the user point-of-view, you break the symmetry of the allocation by removing the \ndeallocation.  If you are trying to hide your garbage collector by making it as smooth\nas \npossible, then why are you trying to inform developers about the garbage collector by\nkeeping \nthis broken symmetry?\n\nJava already made this choice and the consequence is that Java programmers may have \ndifficulties to change to C++ if they are not aware of deallocation.\n\nTo ease the life of recruiter (in 10 years) and to clarify programmers ideas of\nallocation, I \nsuggest to remove the \u0026quot;new\u0026quot; keyword which is just a syntactic sugar over the\nan empty initialization of a structure.\u003c/pre\u003e",
