The result is that when developers go to make cryptographic decisions they\ndon't have the information to make good decisions. In basically any other domain of\nsoftware engineering, you can stumble around and just use any APIs you find, and when\none spits out the right answer, you roll with it.\n\nThis doesn't work in cryptography, because the thing at issue isn't the result, you\ncan't check the result and see if these bytes are secure, the thing at issue is the\nprocess that produced them, and you either need to do some cryptanalysis, or you need\nsomeone to let you know.\n\nDevelopers don't know this, so they'll romp around looking for something named encrypt()\nthat takes a key and a plaintext and spits out what looks like nonsense bytes. Which\nwould be ok, except the API they'll find won't be secure, they need someone to point\nthem the right direction. Developers, as often as not, choose encryption algorithms\nbecause the name sounded familiar, between that and the docs mentioning some nice USG\nstandards DES is in, what could be wrong with it!\n\nAnyways, that's why I think cryptographic library authors have a responsibility to try\nto inform their users about risks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
