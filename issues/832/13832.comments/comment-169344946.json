The vendor spec is very clear:\r\n\r\n\u003e If there is a source directory d/vendor, then, when compiling a source file within the subtree rooted at d, import \"p\" is interpreted as import \"d/vendor/p\" if that exists.\r\n\r\nBut obviously that's not good enough. I'm surprised this is the first we've noticed this. I can't decide if that's good. \r\n\r\nThe a/b directory in your example _is_ non-empty: it contains c. It's not entirely clear what to do. I guess if there are no .go files at all (not even ones with exclusionary build tags) then we could ignore the directory. I'll try that.\r\n",
