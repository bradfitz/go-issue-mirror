He wrote:\r\n\r\n\u003e ... and **type** of `data interface{}` are compile-time constants\r\n\r\nAnyway, I do wonder how a compiler can reliably match a function as complex as `encoding/binary` and intrinsify it. In my experience, `encoding/binary` is very slow when it has to go through struct fields with reflection, and my suggestion would allow to skip that big overhead almost altogether (assuming `reflect.HasPadding` is cached and/or computed at compile-time). Call overhead could then be removed with inlining. ",
