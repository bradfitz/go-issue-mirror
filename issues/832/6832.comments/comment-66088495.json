By the lexical rules for\nexported/unexported the 1.2 behavior seems right but I've always seen error (and string,\nmap, append, copy, len, cap, new, make, etc.) as special and above that rule.\n\nNope, these assignments have always been illegal, but this is enforced at compile time,\nnot runtime so if the compiler didn't stop them, nothing will.\u003c/pre\u003e",
