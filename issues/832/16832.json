	"body": "The compiler should recognize calls to binary.Reader and binary.Writer where the byte order and type of `data interface{}` are compile-time constants, and based on that \"do the right thing\".\r\n\r\nOne candidate for \"the right thing\" is, for target/source types that contain no padding and for the native byte order, alias a byte slice to the storage, and pass that to the read or write method.  Further enhancements could deal with padding and mismatched native/requested byte order.",
