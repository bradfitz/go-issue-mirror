	"body": "I had some confusion over in [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-appengine-go/ZCZk2T9rKDk) that recover would apply to any \"descendant\" goroutine panics, similar to try / catch statements in other languages. Neither the [Go blog](http://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover) nor the [spec](http://golang.org/ref/spec#Handling_panics) is very explicit.\r\n\r\n@dsymonds explained it very succinctly as *\"The recover builtin only applies to the stack frame that it is in, and each goroutine gets its own stack.\"*\r\n\r\nI've been working professionally in Go all day every day for over a year and am just learning this little tidbit, and otherwise consider myself fairly proficient, despite misunderstanding something so basic. I'd like to propose an addition to the spec explaining the difference between panic / recover and try / catch, or at a minimum adding @dsymonds' clarification.",
