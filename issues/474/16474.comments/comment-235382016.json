It's primarily a question of performance.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem is that `io.ReaderFrom` and `io.WriterTo` doesn't document anything about needing to be \"efficient\" (however that is defined), so there are many implementations of them that are sub-par compared to the case where `io.CopyBuffer` just used the user provided buffer only.",
