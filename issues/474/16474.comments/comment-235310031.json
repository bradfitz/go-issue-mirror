	"body": "ReaderFrom does not have to be horribly inefficient, but it can be _inefficient enough_ for the CopyBuffer caller to care. In my case, this was severely reducing the file transfer rate but it might be totally fine for some other application. Someone probably added it for a different use case, without realizing the side effects on CopyBuffer.\r\nConceptually, it seems that ReaderFrom should have a buffer argument and ignore it if it is not needed or nil. Efficient buffer-less ReaderFrom implementation sounds like a rare beast to me.",
