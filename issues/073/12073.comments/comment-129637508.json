	"body": "@jszwedko I think this is a reasonable suggestion, and in retrospect perhaps this would have been a better way to customize cell measurement than with the specific flags we have now. That said, I'm not sure how easy it would be to make this work given that part of the current implementation is using a state-machine like mechanism (but I haven't looked into it in detail).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, my concern is how such a function would interact or possibly interfere with what we have already.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, an additional flag could be provided that would exclude escaped sequences of characters from the width computation. Or perhaps another escape character. Both these might be more in the current spirit of things even though perhaps less flexible than the function.\r\n\r\nIf you want to give it a shot and come up with a concrete implementation, please feel free to go ahead. I'm happy to review but will push back if the result doesn't fit nicely with what we have.",
