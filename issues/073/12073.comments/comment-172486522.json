The biggest problem is coming up\nwith an acceptable API extension for tabwriter.\n\nThe second issue is to decide how the mapping looks like for fixed-width\nCJK, also taking into account modifiers, etc. Luckily people have thought\nabout this and there are some good definitions that are easy to implement.\nThe width package contains all (or almost all) data that is needed to\nimplement this.\n\nThe problem with any fixed mapping, though, is that they don't work in all\nsituations. That's why it shouldn't be tabwriter implementing this.\nOtherwise it is not hard. It just needs to be coordinated with some\ntabwriter API extension.\n\n\nOn Mon, Jan 18, 2016 at 10:48 AM, zhangwei_cs \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e Sounds really complicated, or even impossible! :-(\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/12073#issuecomment-172480637\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
