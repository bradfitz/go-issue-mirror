	"body": "https://weakdh.org/sysadmin.html recommends that users of OpenSSH who want to continue to support non-elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman should disable Group 1 support, by removing the diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 Key Exchange.\r\n\r\nI think it would be in keeping with Go's normal forward looking and strong security posture that SetDefault does not include kexAlgoDH1SHA1 in Config.KeyExchanges. The docs could be updated to indicate that users wishing to enable this deprecated key exchange algorithm should add it at the end of Config.KeyExchanges themselves after calling SetDefaults.\r\n",
