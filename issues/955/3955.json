What do you see instead?\n\n  Additional part of test shows that an extra file descriptor of \n  type DTYPE_MISC is leaked to the child.\n\nThis is related to opening /dev/urandom, which results in a cloned file descriptor. The\nunderlying cause is due to Read in crypto/rand/rand_unix.go having an os.Open() call,\nbut no matching Close() call. This means that anything that does rand.Reader.Read() will\nopen a file descriptor that never gets closed (and in NetBSD we get one that is cloned).\nMy current guess is that FD_CLOEXEC does not work for cloned descriptors, however\nfurther digging is required...\u003c/pre\u003e",
