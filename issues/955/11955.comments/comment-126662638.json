	"body": "Thanks Ian!  Misunderstanding on my part - I didn't realize `cgo` was involved at all in this - I thought your new stuff was just borrowing the export syntax - so I didn't dig into the cgo docs.\r\n\r\nI see you added the `documentation` label - that's great.\r\n\r\nWould it be feasible to recognize that no user code is being exported and produce a warning to point them in the right direction?  If the developer is using `-buildmode=c-archive` they are likely expecting something of theirs to be exported.",
