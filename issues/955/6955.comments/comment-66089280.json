Implement a version of integrated poller that supports level-triggered notification.\nThis will require re-implementing netpoll.goc, e.g. netpollblock will need to register\nthe descriptor in the poller.\n2. Revive the old poller in net package. It was intended for level-triggered IO, so it\nmust be simple to support select in it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
