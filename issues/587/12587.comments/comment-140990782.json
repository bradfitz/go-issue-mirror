You could try and rebuild your program from current tip, and report new error message (with error code). It might help.\r\n\r\nBut, if I would be you, I would add print statements everywhere where memory is allocated or freed in mem_windows.go, and try and understand why one of those calls fail. I would also use vmmap tool to see the state of your process right before it crashes. You could put call into usleep right before the crash, so you can poke around your process with vmmap as long as you like.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot find the problem yourself, you would have to provide (as little as you can) your program with source for us to debug.\r\n\r\nAlex",
