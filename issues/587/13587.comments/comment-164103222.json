Both the working and failing programs are being compiled as roughly:\r\n\r\n    func methodWithError() (err error) {\r\n        perr := new(error)\r\n        defer instrument(perr)()\r\n        *perr = errors.New(\"error\")\r\n        err = *perr\r\n        return\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, the difference is that the implicit `*perr = errors.New(\"error\")` assignment only uses a write barrier for the iface.data field in the working program (i.e., with the explicit `err = errors.New(\"error\")` assignment).\r\n\r\nCC @aclements ",
