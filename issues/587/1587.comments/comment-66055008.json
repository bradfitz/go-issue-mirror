I had GOROOT=C:\\gowin-env\\\\go  which was set in go-env.bat by \nset GOROOT=%_base%\\go\n\nChange GOROOT to either c:\\\\gowin-env\\\\go or c:/gowin-env/go fixes the problem for me.\n\nSo it looks to me like this is not a problem with go or cgo, but with go-env.bat\n\nChanging line 3 to\nset GOROOT=%_base:\\=/%go\nfixes the issue for me.\n\nThanks,\nTarmigan\u003c/pre\u003e",
