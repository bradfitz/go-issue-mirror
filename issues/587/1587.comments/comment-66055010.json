He's cc'd with this reply. \n\nI tend to use forward slashes as path separators for everything on windows by default\nand it seems to work, for me, 99.9% of the time. AFAIK, the MSYS shell interprets\nforward slashes as path separators and backslashes as continuation characters. Root\ndrives for MSYS are nested between two forward slashes, so something like\nGOROOT=/c/gowin-env is correct if you're in the MSYS shell.\n\n-joe\u003c/pre\u003e",
