	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n`1.6.3 linux/amd64`\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/home/kminehart/Work/go\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/usr/lib/go\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/usr/lib/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64\"\r\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\"1\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure questions 3, 4 and 5 are relevant.\r\n\r\nI'd like to make a pull request but I'd also like some discussion beforehand so I don't waste anyone's time.\r\n\r\nI think some added functionality to the `x/net/html` would be nice.  \r\n\r\nFor example, several of the functions on the Node type require that a node not be attached before it is used, like\r\n\r\n`func (n *Node) InsertBefore(newChild, oldChild *Node)`\r\n\r\nwhich will panic if a node has a parent or siblings.  Handling this is fairly straightforward, but there are some unexpected nuances that would be easily solved (and universally avoided) with a function like\r\n\r\n`func (n *Node) Detach()`\r\n\r\nIn order to fix InsertBefore's panic, one could simply set \"newChild.NextSibling\", \"newChild.PrevSibling\", \"newChild.Parent\" to \"nil\".  This would break the Linked Tree because its next and previous siblings, as well as its parent, would still point to that node.  So everyone would essentially have to make their own \"Detach\" function anyways if they plan on moving nodes around in a tree.\r\n\r\nSo I'm proposing adding a Detach function.  Your thoughts?",
