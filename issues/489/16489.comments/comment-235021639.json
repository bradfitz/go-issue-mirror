Part of the use case for `HuffmanOnly` is to compress data that has already been compressed using LZ77 string matching, and the only benefit to be gained is to apply some form of entropy encoding. This detail is crucial in choosing `HuffmanOnly` over `BestSpeed`. Also, what would the difference be between `MaxSpeed` and `BestSpeed`.\r\n\r\nFuthermore, there is some precedence for the name `HuffmanOnly`:\r\n1. It is analogous to the `Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY ` from the C zlib library.\r\n2. It is not just the name of the algorithm, but the name of the methodology used as specified in [RFC1951](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt). In the Abstract section, it specifically mentions that DEFLATE is a combination of LZ77 and Huffman.\r\n\r\nThat said, I believe there is benefit in documenting what HuffmanOnly does and what the intended use case is for it.\r\n\r\n",
