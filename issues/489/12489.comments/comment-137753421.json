Mailing list content is also less reference-able and gets less SEO ranking, making them hard to use as repositories of knowledge. \r\n\r\nRE: /r/reddit - Most of the mods of that subreddit are well known members of the Go community. That group could choose to moderate more effectively. Is there an existing community forum platform that has better moderation tools than reddit that we should be using instead?\r\n\r\nRE: SO answer quality - I agree that the answer quality is spotty at times, but it is better than anything that has come before it, IMO. The only way to improve the current quality level is to get more knowledgeable Go developers involved, which is one of the goals of this proposal.\r\n\r\n",
