	"body": "\u003e The warning and the failure are unrelated. The failure is because the -X flag expects two arguments: a variable name and a value. However, you're only providing a variable name, followed by another -X flag.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e It looks like the git rev-parse HEAD invocation (from https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/devel/mongo-tools/files/patch-build.sh.diff?rev=148181) is yielding an empty string.\r\n\r\nOf course! I should have noticed this. The `git` invocations return empty strings because in my case the source is not from git; it's from a tarball downloaded from GitHub. Sorry for the invalid bug report.",
