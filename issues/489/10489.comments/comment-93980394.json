Please note that I deleted the last sentence about the \"work distribution\" :  \"This is more work for you, the package author, but it is significantly less work for your users, who can use \"go get\" without needing to obtain and build any additional tools.\"\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the go command is not a general-purpose build tool. However, with \"go generate\" it now includes a helper for generating additional source file, such as yacc or protocol buffer compiler output files. See https://blog.golang.org/generate for more details.  Please note that \"go generate\" is intended to be used by the package authors who are then expected to check in the generated files into the source code repository. This way the generated files will be available to users of the packages without any additional work and extra steps of running \"go generate\" between checking out the code and building it.  ",
