You might\r\n  want to take a look at \"Improved Division by Invariant Integers\" by\r\n  me and a collegue of mine.  Your loop will become about 10 times\r\n  faster.  You need to apply this also to generic division (not just the\r\n  one-divisor-word case.\r\n\"\r\n\r\n(paper reference: https://gmplib.org/~tege/division-paper.pdf)\r\n",
