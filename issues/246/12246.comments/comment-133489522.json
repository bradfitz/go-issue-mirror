	"body": "@fogleman, I agree with @ianlancetaylor's diagnosis. Based on the crashing program counter, it looks like this is a NULL pointer dereference in a C library, which probably indicates a bug in one of the wrapper packages you're using (I would guess go-cairo based on what you said about surface.GetData()). Unfortunately, I wasn't able to reproduce it locally. If you run your program under gdb, it should trap at the NULL pointer dereference. If you then use the `backtrace` command, it may give us a better idea of where the crash is actually happening and what's causing it. You might have to install some symbol packages to get a full backtrace from gdb.",
