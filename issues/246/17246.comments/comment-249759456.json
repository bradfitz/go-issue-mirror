I don't think it's a math/big problem, because I get io.ErrUnexpectedEOF with my own type too:\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/O7kfU9oDFq\r\n\r\nHere, my Scanner returns io.EOF, but fmt.Sscan changes it to io.ErrUnexpectedEOF.  I don't understand the rationale behind this.  Looking at the comments for the two error values, I feel that io.EOF is appropriate for my two examples because we're not encountering EOF in the middle of a data structure.",
