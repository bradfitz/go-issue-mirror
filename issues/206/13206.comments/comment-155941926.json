Aren't we suppose to unshallow and pull if the repo is shallow?\r\n\r\nAs a side note, the current behavior of `go get -u` is messing the GOPATHs if the user is not working with unshallow copies. I think we should immediately revert bc1f9d20b40998b87c9a5f56f2b22595de65c2d4 and experiment thoroughly before ever bringing it back.\r\n\r\n/cc @rsc ",
