It's a test case I wrote to see if slice\naccess is slow after noticing a performance difference between Java and Go when doing\nvector multiplication.  \n\nPart of the problem is that the var num declared outside of the outer loop isn't stored\nin a register.  That's why the var n declaration inside the outer loop gives more than a\nfactor of 2 speed up.  Even with that optimization there is still a significant\nperformance hit.\u003c/pre\u003e",
