	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eGarbage collector can add latency on the order of clock tick (usually\n10ms, 2.5ms, or 1ms) to each run.\n\nThis is due to some runtime·usleep(1) and runtime·usleep(100) calls,\nwhich get rounded up to clock period when HPETs are not used.\n\nMore details in this thread:\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-codereviews/AxqxYnioBOQ/discussion\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-codereviews/AxqxYnioBOQ/discussion\u003c/a\u003e\n\nLinux uses HPETs by default, but most ARM machines don't have HPETs.\nSolaris doesn't use HPETs by default, so this issue affects arm\nmachines and solaris.\n\nI'm not sure if we need to do anything (maybe we can just assume\n\u0026quot;fast\u0026quot; machines), I'm logging it so we can refer to it later.\u003c/pre\u003e",
