Also note that such change would not be backward\ncompatible, ie. it could suddenly export things which were previously package private\n(safe from being accessed from other packages).\n\nPS: My native language is also not English, but I, for one, would never ever use a non\nEnglish identifier in my code, except perhaps for some occasional Greek letters in math\nstuff.\n\nI suggest tag #Unfortunate\u003c/pre\u003e",
