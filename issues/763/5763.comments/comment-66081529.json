The current language has a special case for exported\nsymbols.  I really don't know what is better.  As far as I know there\nhas never been a clear consensus either way among people who, unlike\nme, speak those languages, so we've just muddled along with the\ncurrent approach.\n\nAs you say, this can not change until Go 2 anyhow.  But if there is a\nclear consensus for Go 2, then it could certainly change then.\u003c/pre\u003e",
