	"body": "@lych77 Thank you very much for your thoughtful and helpful message. We appreciate getting a more authoritative contribution to this discussion.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Go 1 guarantee prevents us from changing this rule now, but if there ever is a Go 2, there could be a change as I described above:\r\n\r\n\"Change the definition to \"lower case letters and _\r\nare package-local; all else is exported\". Then with non-cased languages, such as\r\nJapanese, we can write 日本語 for an exported name and _日本語 for a local name.\r\nThis rule has no effect, relative to the Go 1 rule, with cased languages. They behave\r\nexactly the same.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly minor change to the implementation but could have major effect for Chinese programmers. Please let us know what you think about this idea.\r\n\r\n",
