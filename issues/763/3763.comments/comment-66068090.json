In\nother words, if you were designing the grammar yourself it is very likely that you would\nalso choose the name QualifiedIdent.\n\nThe name QualifiedIdent matches the naming convention used in other parts of the spec.\nFor example: FunctionDecl (\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/ref/spec#FunctionDecl)\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/ref/spec#FunctionDecl)\u003c/a\u003e is in fact a\nfunction declaration (without the body) and what some people would would call function\ndefinition (with the body). Another example: UnaryExpr\n(\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/ref/spec#Operators)\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/ref/spec#Operators)\u003c/a\u003e does not necessarily need to be an unary operator\nfollowed by an expression. In formal grammar definitions, this style is the norm.\n\nQualifiedIdent will make sense if you look at the grammar from the perspective of\nUnaryExpr.\n\nI believe we can close this issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
