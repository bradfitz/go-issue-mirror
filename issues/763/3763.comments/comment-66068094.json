The current description is a bit murky.\n\nThat said, it's not a mistake (at least grammatically), but the corresponding language\nis missing. There's also a (intended) ambiguity: For instance, the expression x.f could\nbe both a QualifiedIdent or an Operand (using the identifier only form of the\nQualifiedIdent) followed by a Selector. The former denotes an identifier in another\npackage, while the latter denotes a field of a struct. For the purpose of explaining the\ngrammar, the ambiguity is helpful (for the purpose of parsing, it is not - but this is\nnot the primary goal of this document).\n\nWorking on a proposal (CL).\u003c/pre\u003e",
