	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIn go (now v1.1.1), an identifier is exported only if it starts with a character in\nUnicode class \u0026quot;Lu\u0026quot; (uppercase letter).\n\nThe feature works fine for Western languages, but fails for CJK languages. All CJK\ncharacters are letters but they are not uppercase. Therefore, these are not exported:\n\n    var 成本 int = 5        // Chinese ideograph\n    func ぶつける() { ... } // Japanese Hiragana (they are indeed letters)\n\nIt is very strange to use, say Z成本 or Jぶつける as identifiers.\n\nI don't know how to properly control the permission. But at least I think it is\npreferable to use CJK characters as *uppercase* letters, if we have no other choices\n(more keywords, etc.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
