What do you see instead?\nSuccess even if the current user cannot write to $GOROOT. Instead, the\nbuild fails because make.bash calls 'gomake install' in crypto/rsa for some\nreason. This is a regression from 2010-04-27.\n\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux, amd64, not relevant.\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n17ded5ad443b release.2010-05-04/release\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
