	"body": "In the case of the syscall package, the mksyscall_windows command does not care about `GOOS` or `GOARCH`.  The problem Alex was encountering is that he is setting `GOOS=windows` so that the go tool sees the go:generate command in syscall_windows.go, but now that `GOOS=windows` setting is passed on to `go run`, and so the go tool builds a Windows executable, which then fails to run.  The fix is to move the go:generate command to a different file, so that it is not necessary to set `GOOS=windows` for `go generate`.",
