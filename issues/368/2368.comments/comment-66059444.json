From godoc runtime SetFinalizer:\n\n...\nFinalizers are run in dependency order: if A points at B, both have\nfinalizers, and they are otherwise unreachable, only the finalizer\nfor A runs; once A is freed, the finalizer for B can run.\nIf a cyclic structure includes a block with a finalizer, that\ncycle is not guaranteed to be garbage collected and the finalizer\nis not guaranteed to run, because there is no ordering that\nrespects the dependencies.\n...\u003c/pre\u003e",
