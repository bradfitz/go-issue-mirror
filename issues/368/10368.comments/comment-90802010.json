The zip file contains most testdata, /lib and /test.\n\nThat's the reason why go/types and gcimporter test currently fail on nacl.\n\nWe can include package sources into the fake file system zip, but we\ndefinitely\ndon't want to also include pkg/nacl_$GOARCH/, because it's too large (and\nactually impossible, due to recursive dependencies (the file system zip is\ncontained\nin the syscall package.)\n",
