GOGC it is!\r\n\r\nRunning the Go 1.5 compiled program with GOGC=400 makes it complete the task in the exact same amount of time as the previous (Go 1.4.2 compiled) version: 32 seconds.\r\n\r\nJust out of curiosity, I tested the program with GOGC=800 but I didn't gain too much: completion time went down to about 30 seconds. I'm sure total memory usage went a bit up though.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that for my case a value of about 400, maybe 500 is the most optimal, speed-wise.\r\n\r\nShould we close this issue now?",
