	"body": "@aclements Thanks for the suggestion of trying `GODEBUG=gcstoptheworld=1`. I'm only testing with Go 1.5 now. Here are the results:\r\n\r\nWhen `gcstoptheworld=1` is set, the total time to complete the task took even more time: 58s.\r\nWithout `gcstoptheworld=1` it took \"only\" 50s.\r\nWhen I set `GOGC=800` (with no gcstoptheworld set) the exact same program completes the exact same task in just 29s !\r\nSo the winner for me is definitely `GOGC=800` with Go 1.5\r\n\r\nWhile I'm sure the program uses more memory with the `GOGC=800` setting, I can live with it.\r\n\r\nThese are pretty consistent times too: I always ran at least 5-6 tests and I always saw pretty much the same execution times (with same environment variables set).",
