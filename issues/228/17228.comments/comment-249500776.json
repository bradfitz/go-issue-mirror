	"body": "@randall77, ok, looks our opinions are generally the same. The small difference is I think it is not a good explanation to just say maps/slices/channels are different for they are reference values in the faq. \r\nThe faq should make further explanation how Map/Slice/Chan types are represented internally (just show they are pointer wrappers is ok, no need to make detailed explanation).\r\n\r\nThe current faq makes people think maps/slices/channels are the only reference values in Golang. (In fact, I ever encountered many go developers who think so). \r\n\r\nI think, the faq will be more clearer and eliminate much confusing if it both states:\r\n1. all value assignments in Golang are shallow copies\r\n2. Map/Slice/Channle are just pointer wrappers.\r\nBy doing this, the word \"reference\" can be removed from the Golang dictionary totally.\r\n\r\nIf go team think the word \"reference\" is too important to remove, it would be better to define it as \"pointer wrapper\".",
