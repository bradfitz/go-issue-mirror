	"body": "### What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the word \"reference\" in Golang is totally different from other languages.\r\nIn Golang, \"reference\" means a pointer referring another value.\r\nThere is no reference values in Golang (if pointers are not viewed as reference values).\r\n\r\nIn the faq, maps, slices, and channels references are viewed as reference values (https://golang.org/doc/faq#references), this is inappropriate and will make many confusions in the process of learning Go.\r\n\r\nIn fact, maps, slices, and channels (and function values) are all wrappers of pointers. They are just normal internal struct values.\r\n\r\nI proposal to replace the question \"why are maps, slices, and channels references while arrays are values\" with an appropriate one, which will explain the internal structure of maps, slices, and channels. \r\n\r\nRemove the \"reference value\" concept is good to unify the definitions and make the docs clear.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nThere are 4 occurrences of \"references\", 3 of them are inappropriate.\r\n\r\n",
