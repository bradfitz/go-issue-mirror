Presumably not that I\r\n\u003e keep them all in one source tree, since that would conflict with source\r\n\u003e control.  Where do I put tools that I go get like godoc?  A few simple\r\n\u003e pointers on multi-workspace setups would be helpful.\r\n\r\nOf course, now I understand that the single workspace layout *doesn't*\r\nconflict with source control because workspace != repository and you don't\r\nneed multiple workspaces.  But I think it was this initial confusion that\r\nled me to a much more complicated and non-standard workspace setup.",
