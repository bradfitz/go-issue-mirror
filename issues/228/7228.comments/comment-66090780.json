Also, the error message given was very confusing since initially it\nseemed like the stat system call was failing, except it was impossible to see why.\n\nSurely this could be fixed by: if LookPath returns an error, check to see if the\ncmd.Path is valid with respect to cmd.Dir?\n\nThen you couldn't end up in the extremely confusing situation where the success of the\nCommand() call depends on the existence of a file which is not being executed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
