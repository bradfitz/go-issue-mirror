That's not the case. forkAndExecInChild is a function in\nthe syscall package that forks, chdirs to the directory, and then execs the program.\nKnowing that, it's obvious why running \"./ls\" with a Dir field set would run the \"ls\"\nbinary from the that directory, and never the one from the working directory.\n\nUgh.\u003c/pre\u003e",
