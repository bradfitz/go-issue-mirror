To do that we'd need to add more unexported state to the\nCmd struct to signify that the Command function was used to construct the Cmd and that\nthe LookPath failed.\n\nI have three concerns with this change:\n\n1. It makes the behavior of Command and Cmd's run methods do surprising things. I\ncertainly wouldn't expect it to try LookPath in two separate locations.\n\n2. It will change the behavior of existing programs. Even if not technically backward\ncompatible, it adds complexity. \n\n3. I just don't think it's the right behavior. The directory in which you exec a process\nhas nothing to do with the location of the process binary. Also, you're specifying the\ncommand path before setting the Dir field, so it's not clear that you *should* be\nexpecting it to look inside Dir for the binary. (You yourself said that if you hadn't\nseen it apparently working before, you wouldn't have thought it would be the case.)\n\nI think this is just one of those instances in debugging where your assumptions were\nwrong and you went down a blind alley. Happens to the best of us.\n\nThis is all IMO, and my word is not necessarily final. I am happy to discuss it further.\u003c/pre\u003e",
