The LookPath\npart is done by the current process, while the Dir is where the new process is being\nexecuted.\n\nYour proposed fix may change the behavior of existing programs, and I don't think it's\nthe right thing to do anyway.\n\nIf you know the directory you want to run in, use exec.Command(filepath.Join(dir, bin))\nin the first place.\n\nAgree that there might be some documentation concerns here.\u003c/pre\u003e",
