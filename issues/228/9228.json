	"body": "Rick and Austin both ran into problems with trying to set up $GOPATH. They both found https://golang.org/doc/code.html but it didn't help either of them. Perhaps the doc should start out more prescriptive and only _then_ move into the description of what a workspace is.\r\n\r\nAlso, the recipe given uses $HOME/go as $GOPATH, which is just about the worst possible suggestion, because it's where we tell people to check out Go trees in http://golang.org/doc/install/source. This doc should probably use $HOME/work. People will be able to figure out how to generalize to other values of 'work'.\r\n\r\nIt looks like all the necessary information _is_ in the doc, it's just too hard to find if you're skimming trying to solve a problem. Maybe there should be a short intro that hits the highlights:\r\n\r\n(1) mkdir $HOME/work; export GOPATH=$HOME/work; export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\r\n(2) Your own work goes in $GOPATH/src/github.com/you/project. Your version control applies to that subdirectory tree, not to all of $GOPATH.\r\n\r\nand then the rest of the doc can elaborate.\r\n\r\n@adg @aclements @rlh ",
