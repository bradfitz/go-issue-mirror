	"body": "by **lorresylvan@yahoo.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWebSocket peers exchange messages. A message is composed of one or more frames.\n\nThe (*Conn).Read and (Codec).Receive methods return a single frame. There is no\nmechanism to detect message boundaries or otherwise compose frames into a message.\n\nTo use this package, an application must provide its own framing or assume that the peer\nsends single frame messages. My guess is that most applications assume that the peer\nsends single frame messages because that's what browsers and the websocket package do.\nThis assumption is not true of all peers.\u003c/pre\u003e",
