	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n  1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\n  GOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\n  GOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\n  GOHOSTOS=\"darwin\"\r\n  GOOS=\"darwin\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n(Use play.golang.org to provide a runnable example, if possible.)\r\n\r\n  Basically, I'm just calling ovftool with some arguments using exec.Command, but it's erroring out due to the way quotes are being passed in. Here's an example: https://play.golang.org/p/thL1dc3yxd\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n  This is what I get when ovftool is called via exec.Command:\r\n\r\n  Opening OVF source: \"vsphere-ubuntu-14.04.4.vmx\"\r\n  Error: Failed to open OVF descriptor\r\n  Completed with errors\r\n\r\n  But when the command is copy-pasted into the terminal, it works.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n  I expected it to work exactly like it would If I typed it in a terminal. I don't quite understand what is or isn't happening so I don't know if this is a Go problem or not.\r\n",
