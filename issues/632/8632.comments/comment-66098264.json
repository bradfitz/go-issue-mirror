If you submit a CL (change list), it is likely to get submitted,\nbut I don't think anyone is actively maintaining go.exp/inotify anymore. See\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/doc/contribute.html\u003c/a\u003e to get started.\n\nRegarding fsnotify, I've started to pull a part the code to have a layer wrapping\nsyscall and another that builds on that. So far I've only done this with kqueue, adding\nfunctions like kqueue(), register(), read() and a durationToTimespec() helper. It isn't\na separate package yet with an exported API, but that's something I have been thinking\nabout.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify\"\u003ehttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
