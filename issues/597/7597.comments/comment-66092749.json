It would hopefully have a similar effect to bring more\nvisibility to the race-detector.\n\nThat may not be possible though, since the race detector probably won't work on the\nplayground platform. AFAIK it only works on 64-bit darwin/linux/windows/freebsd, while\nthe playground is nacl/386 I believe.\u003c/pre\u003e",
