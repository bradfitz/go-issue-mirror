Location\n\n   The Location header field is used to specify to the server that the\n   script is returning a reference to a document rather than an actual\n   document (see sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.4).  It is either an absolute\n   URI (optionally with a fragment identifier), indicating that the\n   client is to fetch the referenced document, or a local URI path\n   (optionally with a query string), indicating that the server is to\n   fetch the referenced document and return it to the client as the\n   response.\n\n      Location        = local-Location | client-Location\n      client-Location = \u0026quot;Location:\u0026quot; fragment-URI NL\n      local-Location  = \u0026quot;Location:\u0026quot; local-pathquery NL\n      fragment-URI    = absoluteURI [ \u0026quot;#\u0026quot; fragment ]\n      fragment        = *uric\n      local-pathquery = abs-path [ \u0026quot;?\u0026quot; query-string ]\n      abs-path        = \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; path-segments\n      path-segments   = segment *( \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; segment )\n      segment         = *pchar\n      pchar           = unreserved | escaped | extra\n      extra           = \u0026quot;:\u0026quot; | \u0026quot;@\u0026quot; | \u0026quot;\u0026amp;\u0026quot; | \u0026quot;=\u0026quot; | \u0026quot;+\u0026quot; | \u0026quot;$\u0026quot; | \u0026quot;,\u0026quot;\n\n   The syntax of an absoluteURI is incorporated into this document from\n   that specified in RFC 2396 [2] and RFC 2732 [7].  A valid absoluteURI\n   always starts with the name of scheme followed by \u0026quot;:\u0026quot;; scheme names\n   start with a letter and continue with alphanumerics, \u0026quot;+\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;.\u0026quot;.\n   The local URI path and query must be an absolute path, and not a\n   relative path or NULL, and hence must start with a \u0026quot;/\u0026quot;.\n\n   Note that any message-body attached to the request (such as for a\n   POST request) may not be available to the resource that is the target\n   of the redirect.\u003c/pre\u003e",
