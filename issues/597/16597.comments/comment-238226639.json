Can you provide proof\n\u003e that signals do work in other client implementations with this server?\n\n\n\nIt's a good question, but I don't know the answer. I do know that running\nan Exec killall -SIGNALNAME over ssh does work, which is the (ugly)\nworkaround I've been employing. So either this should either be fixed, or\ndocumented that it doesn't work with the most common ssh server out there\nor something, because this definitely doesn't fit with the principle of\nleast surprise. Maybe even in the worst case scenario that this doesn't\nwork with openssh that we should fall back to running that killall command\nfor the user behind the scenes. If that's the answer, I'll write the patch\nif someone can help me to know how to detect the server capabilities and\nthe pid of the previously run command.\n",
