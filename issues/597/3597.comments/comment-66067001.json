In these way, all those go tools/cmds can be built successfully(with some\nmodification on the golang sources), and also the runtime/cgo package, except the final\nstage that requiring the HOST-built go tools to rebuild all go stuffs, it failed because\nI'm using an amd64 host, but now GOHOSTARCM=arm has made a arm version for those go\ntools.\u003c/pre\u003e",
