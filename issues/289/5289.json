	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eSeveral people have reported illegal instructions running programs from go1.1.beta2 on\n386. It appears to be a floating-point code generation issue. Using GO386=387 doesn't\nfix it, which means there are several things to think about:\n\n1) Are SSE instructions leaking into a non-SSE build? (Or is something else going on.)\nFix the compiler if so.\n2) What are those instructions?\n3) Should we build variants of the packages for SSE and SSE2 and 387? Just one is not\ngoing to work for everyone.\n4) What is our long term plan here?\u003c/pre\u003e",
