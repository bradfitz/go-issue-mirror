	"body": "archive/zip creates a new compress/flate.Reader for each file read from the archive. If there are many small files in an archive, this allocates a lot of memory.\r\n\r\ncompress/flate allows re-using of Readers, see https://codereview.appspot.com/97140043/\r\n\r\nUsing this in archive/zip reduces the amount of memory allocated/GCed. In a real-world scenario when reading ~ 500 small files from a ZIP archive this gives a speedup of 1.5x-2x.\r\n\r\nVersion: go1.6rc2",
