In principle, it could be\ndone entirely in data.\n\nThe tables are 512 interface values: type image.Color holding an image.RGBA. The RGBA\nvalue could fit in a word, and the interface's type pointer is known, so in principle\nthe tables could be laid out at compile time. As it stands, it's about 90 bytes of init\ncode to generate each table entry.\u003c/pre\u003e",
