People with weird/old processors can just build it\nfrom source, or get it from elsewhere.\n\nI would prefer to address the support problem: have the 32-bit binaries at start do a\nCPU capability check and compare against what they were built for. If the CPU doesn't\nsupport the instructions which will fail later, bail out early with a nice error message\n(\"Not built with GO386=xxxx\").\n\nEven if we build three versions of the 32-bit packages, people will still be downloading\nthe wrong ones and bugging the mailing list \u0026 issue tracker, and redistributing the\nwrong binaries elsewhere.\u003c/pre\u003e",
