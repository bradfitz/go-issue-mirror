Of of\nthose go routines was using goamz which caught the panic and returned an error, but the\nother didn't which crashed my server :(\n\nIt's definitely not common, I've run the same code for over two weeks without this\nissue, and probably not easily repeatable since I'm a bit clueless as to why\n/dev/urandom would be unavailable.  I had recently restarted my application which uses\ngoagain for seemless restarts.\n\nWould having a fallback to math/rand make sense there? Wasn't really expecting a panic\nin this package.\u003c/pre\u003e",
