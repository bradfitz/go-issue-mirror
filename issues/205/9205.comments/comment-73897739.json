Some examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u0026os.PathError{Op:\"read\", Path:\"/dev/urandom\", Err:0xb}\r\n\u0026url.Error{Op:\"Post\", URL:\"https://platform-api.newrelic.com/platform/v1/metrics\", Err:(*errors.errorString)(0xc20844fbd0)}\r\ntls: short read from Rand: read /dev/urandom: resource temporarily unavailable\r\n```\r\nI've found a way for this to happen consistently so I'll give some background:\r\n\r\nI'm running a API based on [Revel](https://github.com/birkirb/revel/tree/change_no_body_compression_handling). It's been modified by me to use [GoAgain](https://github.com/rcrowley/goagain) to fork the process, shutdown and start again with a new listener. \r\n\r\nThis didn't happen from the start, but at some point, probably given increase traffic through the API this started to happen consistently every time I restarted the app using the fork method.  I start to get massive amount of errors. I can alleviate those by stopping the process completely and start it again (no forks).\r\n\r\nSo something must be broken, not cleaned up or otherwise causing issues.  This error makes it really tough for me to run updates to my application since I have to manually restart servers that exhibit the errors, not all do, but some will. \r\n\r\nI'd really appreciate any help in getting to the bottom of this. \r\nDo the symptoms described here give an idea of any possible causes?",
