I do the latter in llgo (no pkg-config available, LDFLAGS are dynamic), and\nI'm getting the same error.\n\nSeems the problem is that cgo doesn't look for CGO_LDFLAGS, and so it gets missed when\nthe _cgo_flags file is written. This file is used for recording flags for external\nlinking.\n\nI have a CL incoming which should fix that particular issue... but it wouldn't fix Issue\n5224.\u003c/pre\u003e",
