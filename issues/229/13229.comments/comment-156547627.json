I think that sounds right because for a prime, MR needs to try all the 40 bases, for a composite there are chances to get eliminated for each base.\r\n\r\nI think MR enjoys a well implemented expNN, lucasMod is bare minimum.\r\n\r\nThere are constant costs as well. I'll make polynomial fits to these data \u0026 come back :)",
