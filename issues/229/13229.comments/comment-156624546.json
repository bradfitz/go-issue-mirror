There are many other concerns for the generation of large random primes in a cryptographic context, and in fact in that case only a few rounds of Miller-Rabin are required. See Menezes et al., Handbook of Applied Cryptography, 1997, pp. 145-149. If you can't find that, see Appendix F of FIPS 186-4, which has some of the same information.",
