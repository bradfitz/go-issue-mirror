	"body": "Do you have a github branch?  The Lucas test ought to be faster than that, but of course language details have an impact.  Even with the 4-8x speed, I'm wondering why BPSW comes out slower for 512-bit or 1024-bit random inputs.  For almost all composites this size they should be identical -- the pretest and first M-R will eliminate them.  Which leaves the primes, and even if the Lucas test costs 8 M-R tests, this should come out 5 times faster.\r\n\r\nFor my program, in a different language and different library, 1024-bit random inputs are ~2x faster with BPSW vs. MR(40) (including time to generate random inputs).",
