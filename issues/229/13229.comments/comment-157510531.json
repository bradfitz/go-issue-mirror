It's method C skipping evens.\r\n\r\nMethod B would choose the first of these to give (D|n)=-1 and gcd(n,2PQD)=1:\r\n  D=5  P=3 Q=1\r\n  D=9  P=5 Q=4\r\n  D=13 P=5 Q=3\r\n  D=17 P=5 Q=2\r\n  D=21 P=5 Q=1\r\n  D=25 P=7 Q=6\r\n  ...\r\n\r\nThe parameter selection use by Pari/GP is fairly similar to Baillie's, just using P += 2 so only odd values of P are selected.  Other than that, its basically the same (Q=1, D=P^2-4).  Pari/GP also doesn't do the full extra strong test.\r\n\r\nI don't believe Baillie wrote a paper with method C.  The only thing I have to go on is his OEIS entry.  I came up with the same idea at about the same time (it's rather obvious), but his name pulls far more weight than mine :).\r\n\r\nI think good methods are:\r\n  - strong Lucas plus method A (Selfridge)\r\n  - almost extra strong with method C (or the odds-only-P variant -- so this test is the Pari/GP varant)\r\n  - extra strong with method C (odds-only-P if you'd like)\r\n",
