There's no shame in wanting to understand advantages and disadvantages of a proposal before implementing it. You failed to provide some information. ... you did not provide \"the relevant literature\" (wikipedia is not literature). I understand that you may expect a reviewer to go on wikipedia and then doing a literature search, but this is really something that you should help with as part of your proposal.\r\n\r\nTo which you replied:\r\n\u003e If you really cared, you would have read my patch and see the two relevant literature references as comments. Also, yes I would appreciate if a reviewer god damn reads the .ucking wiki article.\r\n\r\nThis is not really a productive way to have a conversation. You're not doing anything to help your case.\r\n",
