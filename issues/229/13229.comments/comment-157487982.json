	"body": "Yes, the Feitsma/Galway list of base-2 SPSPs can be used to verify there are no counterexamples under 2^64 for those 7 bases.\r\n\r\nFor the strong test, method A (Selfridge) is typically used.  I'm not aware of anyone using method B.\r\n\r\nYes, that's what Baillie called Method C in 2013 on OEIS.  Using it in combination with the extra strong test yields the known set of ES Lucas pseudoprimes (which have no overlap with base 2 strong pseudoprimes under 2^64, and are anti-correlated so we expect overlaps to be rare).  I like the extra strong Lucas test, as it is computationally faster, has a smaller known error bound, and has a smaller set of pseudoprimes making overlaps less likely.  But the strong Lucas test is fine and arguably gets more use.",
