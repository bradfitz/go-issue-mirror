It's perfectly fine to continue to have detailed discussion here, like you've been doing, but the way we move forward is that the discussion converges on a clear statement of what it is you are proposing. See [my earlier comment](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13229#issuecomment-156521756) for the specific details that should be in the proposal.\r\n\r\nNote that you don't have to write a design doc for this, but we do need that clear statement.\r\n",
