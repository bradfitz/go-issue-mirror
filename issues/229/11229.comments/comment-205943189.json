If not possible/not preferred/whatever the reasons are, please state that decision early/ASAP to increase the time span in which I can pre-announce changing the name of `cznic/goyacc` to probably, @bradfitz credited, `yc`. The world will not end in the later case, I guess B-)\r\n\r\nPS: Another name clash is the fork of cznic/goyacc the [TIDB project](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/d01d516105d2bc33ace72e2b310aab0263f7711a/Makefile#L66) is using.",
