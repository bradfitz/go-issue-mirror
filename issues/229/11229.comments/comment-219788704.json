The improved error messages mechanism is not compatible at all. Go tool yacc uses non standard yacc extensions, goyacc uses an external xerrors file. Moreover, this mechanism in go tool yacc is more capable than that of goyacc. Also the produced error messages are different not only literally, bot also the approach is different. Goyacc produces the full LA set in the message, which is noisy, although nice when debugging grammars.",
