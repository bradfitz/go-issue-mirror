I think removing it without\nprior notice will break a lot of //go:generate lines.\n\nI propose that we make a copy of cmd/yacc to x/tools/cmd/goyacc\nat the start of the Go 1.7 freeze, but we release cmd/yacc one more\ntime in Go 1.7 and call out in the release docs that Go 1.7 is the last\nrelease containing `go tool yacc` and prompt users to switch to\nx/tools/cmd/goyacc.\n",
