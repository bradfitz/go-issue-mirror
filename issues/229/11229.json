	"body": "For Go 1.6 I intend to replace the use of cmd/yacc in the compiler with a hand-written recursive descent parser, as much a line-by-line translation of the current go.y as is possible. I've already done the conversion once, a month ago, although I'll have to redo it due to recent compiler changes.\n\nAfter that's done, there will be no uses of cmd/yacc in the main repo. A recent mail to golang-dev points out that cmd/yacc has never shipped with gccgo. \n\nPerhaps for Go 1.6 we should think about moving cmd/yacc out of the main distribution and into a subrepo. It will be easier for people to 'go get' and stay up to date, and there will no longer be any compelling reason for keeping it in the main repo (if there ever was).",
