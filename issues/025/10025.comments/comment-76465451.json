	"body": "Thanks for the report. I think that this is working as intended. Within a run of non-space-separated imports, go/format and goimports both sort and deduplicate. They do no sorting (and consequently no deduplication) across groups or blank lines. This leaves some amount of control to decide how to organize your imports. This is particularly important with magic imports such as used by cgo. If we were to rearrange all imports at will, that would prevent third parties from implementing a tool such as cgo, which would be a pity.",
