As mentioned by @griesemer this is a very special case and I am not sure that efficient map identity comparison should be sacrificed for it. However, I think the documentation should in fact mention it, as \"but it will scan elements of arrays, slices, maps ...\" is not correct as is, as can be seen in the example above.",
