From the documentation:\n\n\nOnly those elements present in the value will be set in the returned time\nstructure.  Also, if the input string represents an inconsistent time\n(such as having the wrong day of the week), the returned value will also\nbe inconsistent.  In any case, the elements of the returned time will be\nsane: hours in 0..23, minutes in 0..59, day of month in 0..31, etc.\nYears must be in the range 0000..9999.\n\n\nThe day of week is simply not set, so it is zero (Sunday).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
