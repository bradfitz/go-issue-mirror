	"body": "by **brian@streampunks.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eCurrently, in net/http/httputil/reverseproxy.go in ServeHTTP the code currently replaces\nany prior value set to X-Forwarded-For. The de-facto standard is to append the value for\neach additional proxy. You can see the problem by simply running the go reverse proxy\nbehind another proxy and the header will be replaced.\n\nThe problem is trivial to fix by replacing the Set call in this:\n\n    outreq.Header.Set(\u0026quot;X-Forwarded-For\u0026quot;, clientIp)\n\nto an Add like this:\n\n    outreq.Header.Add(\u0026quot;X-Forwarded-For\u0026quot;, clientIp)\u003c/pre\u003e",
