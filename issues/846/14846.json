What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nppc64le\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\ngo tool objdump a.out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nA disassembly of the program.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nobjdump: disassemble a.out: unsupported architecture\r\n\r\nI've seen a CL for this from Minux a while ago but haven't seen any recent updates.\r\nIf this was started but needs finishing I could help with that.\r\n\r\n",
