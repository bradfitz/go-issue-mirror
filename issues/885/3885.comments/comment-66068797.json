V8's execution time was almost\nequal to empty loop time, maybe it somehow eliminated repeated assignments. I changed\n\"a[123] = 456\" to \"a[i] = i\", so it no longer can be eliminated, and results were a\nlittle different:\n\nV8 ~0.7s\nPyPy ~1.1s\nGo ~3.8s (x5.4 V8, x3.4 PyPy)\n\nA little better for Go now, but still doen't look optimal. And gccgo performed worse\nthis time.\n\nI'm really not an expert here, but i didn't found existing benchmarks of Go's map type.\nIt will be great if someone can write less synthetic benchmarks doing random reading and\nwriting and using various types as keys.\u003c/pre\u003e",
