On the other hand I\nwonder if maybe reporting certain optimizations applied during the general\nrewrite rules is something that will come up again.\n\nOn Tue, May 17, 2016 at 5:05 PM Keith Randall \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e There are 2 things that used to be reported by -m which are now missing\n\u003e with SSA. One is \"shift bounds check elided\", the other is \"index bounds\n\u003e check elided\". The former seems difficult as that removal is now implicitly\n\u003e embedded in rewrite rules. You could also argue it isn't that interesting.\n\u003e The latter we should probably replicate wherever SSA removes bounds checks.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you commented.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/15086#issuecomment-219852371\u003e\n\u003e\n",
