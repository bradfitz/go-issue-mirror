	"body": "This bug is wrong.  The 'index bounds check elided' error comes from walk.go, and we're still producing it; the test for this (bounds.go) is enabled for amd64 and does not fail.  What more nearly needs to activate `ssa/prove/debug` is `-d slice` for sliceopt.go (that's bug #13608) though everything there is stated in terms of the ssa check operand that can be proved redundant, instead of the context (1st slice operand, 2nd slice operand, etc) so it still requires a separate test, or substantial replumbing in the prove code to get the context passed through properly to replicate these messages.  And if the recommended change is made (-m activates ssa/prove/debug), the only change to the output anywhere in the tests is 4 new errors in escape2.go that have nothing to do with escape analysis.\r\n\r\nThe append optimizations, I am not sure that we are doing them; I went looking, and it's not clear where they would be, so that might be a bug of sorts.  But that's not this bug.",
