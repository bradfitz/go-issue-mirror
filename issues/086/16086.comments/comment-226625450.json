	"body": "cmd/vet makes some decisions based on types.  When the type is defined in some other package, cmd/vet tries to determine the type by looking at the installed packages.  This has the fortunate consequences of better results, but the unfortunate consequence of results that are harder to reproduce.\r\n\r\nIn this case you can see that the types in question are in different packages.  The vet warning `composite literal uses unkeyed fields` is only produced for struct literals, as that is the only case where it really matters.  Presumably `appctypes.Annotations` and `appctypes.Exec` are not struct types, so the warning is useless anyhow.\r\n\r\nClosing because this is expected behavior.  Please feel free to comment if you disagree.",
