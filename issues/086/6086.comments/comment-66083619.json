Put in some prints in the bufio test and you'll see. It triggers\nfor the dataAndEOFReader in the test, but that's about it. I can't\ndemonstrate any possible problems because in real use cases it just doesn't\nhappen.\n\nWe expose slices in Read and Write all the time. What we don't then do, as\nfar as I know, is give the buffer to completely unrelated code to reuse. If\nthe decision to give it away is buggy, now completely unrelated code is\npaying the price.\u003c/pre\u003e",
