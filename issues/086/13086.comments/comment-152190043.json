What about your correct benchmark with my pseudo-fair implementation? Perhaps your results show only that we don't want complete fairness on by default (or perhaps even at all). My pseudo-fairness change fixed the real-world pathology with only a 5% slowdown in the macrobenchmarks (bench -bench=http), so maybe that's a better starting place.\n\nIf you wanted to switch the detection to time instead of number of spurious wakeups, how would you incorporate real time efficiently? My concern is that I didn't want to put new time calls into every Lock acquisition.",
