	"body": "I think we can do something along the lines of your proposal. However, we should not rely on absolute number of failed acquire tries. What matters for both user perceived latency and performance is real time (for performance it is probably frequency of acquisitions, but we can approximate it with real time). If we take a frequently acquired mutex (like the rand test), 3 is effectively the same as 1 (see the benchmark results). User does not care about number of mutex acquisitions, he cares about milliseconds.\r\n10 ms looks like a good number to trigger hand off more (that's the GC latency guarantee and that's the goroutine preemption period).",
