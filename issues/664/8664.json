	"body": "by **serge.hulne**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eHi,\n\nI have been using nsf  \u0026quot;gothic\u0026quot; (tcl/tk go binding) libary under Linux for a\nwhile now : it works very well and is very convenient for adding a tcl/tck-based\ngraphical interface to a Go application.\n\nHowever I experienced a few problems installing it under Mac.\n\nIn an attempt to solve that problem, I made the following modifications to my Mac\ndevelopment environment:\n\n- Installed the latest version of Xcode.\n\n- Removed \u0026quot;port\u0026quot; (port of the Linux tools for Mac) entirely and installed it\nfrom scratch to the latest version.\n\n- Upgraded to the latest stable version of Go.\n\nNow at least I can install \u0026quot;gothic\u0026quot; under Mac and it compiles without\ncomplaining.\n\nI had to make the following changes to the \u0026quot;interpreter.go\u0026quot; file, so that the\nheader directives point to the correct library location:\n\n  5 #cgo !tcl85 LDFLAGS: -L/opt/local/lib\n  6 #cgo !tcl85 LDFLAGS: -ltcl8.6 -ltk8.6\n  7 #cgo !tcl85 CFLAGS:  -I/opt/local/include/tcl8.6\n  8 #cgo darwin tcl85 CFLAGS: -I/opt/local/include\n  9 #cgo darwin tcl85 CFLAGS: -I/opt/local/include/tcl8.6\n\ninstead of the original:\n\n\n#cgo !tcl85 LDFLAGS: -ltcl8.6 -ltk8.6\n#cgo !tcl85 CFLAGS: -I/usr/include/tcl8.6\n#cgo tcl85 LDFLAGS: -ltcl8.5 -ltk8.5\n#cgo tcl85 CFLAGS: -I/usr/include/tcl8.5\n#cgo darwin tcl85 CFLAGS: -I/opt/X11/include\n\nSo that is points to the correct libraries.\n\nThe current situation is that the examples do compile, without any warnings or error\nmessages.\n\nThe problem is that the resulting executables run correctly only once, after reboot and\ncannot be started a second time (they only display a blank interface).\n\n\nThe odd thing is that Tck/Tk and Go, which are both freshly installed to the latest\nversion, work perfectly *separately*. That lives only a few possibilities: \n\na) cgo could have some portability problems. \n\nb) the \u0026quot;port\u0026quot; implementation of Tck/Tk differs from the the Linux\nimplementation (but then \u0026quot;gothic\u0026quot; would not compile without any warning). \n\nc) I might have done something wrong that eludes me ... \n\n\n\nHas anybody had more success in using \u0026quot;gothic\u0026quot; on a mac ?\n\nI yes, would be very grateful for some help on how to proceed.\n\n\nThanks !\u003c/pre\u003e",
