	"body": "Hi, \r\nWe are working on providing an alternative of GnuPG, \r\nWith the help of x/crypto/openpgp we can easily read and parse a key, and decrypt it with passphrase, \r\nBut there's no support for encryption \u0026 serialization of PrivateKeys, as the [comment](https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/master/openpgp/packet/private_key.go#L134) says: TODO(agl): support encrypted private keys\r\n\r\nWe made some [implementation](https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/26773/) of this feature, but it needs review and suggestion about the configuration for s2k related parameters (s2kMode, salt, hashFunction, iteratedCount)\r\n\r\nRelated RFC4880 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-3.7.2.1",
