I can provide the full function call path from request.FormFile if needed.\r\n\r\nWhen IE is run in the 'Internet Zone', by using 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost, only the filename is returned, as expected, and not the (modified) filepath.\r\n\r\nSo, it appears we have a bit of a corner case where developers who are working with, or intend to use, localhost on IE may get sidetracked a bit. A note in the docs might suffice - but you guys are in a better position to make that call. Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nScott",
