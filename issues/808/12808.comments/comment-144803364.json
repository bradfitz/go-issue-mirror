After reading what you said, I do think it's at least a documentation issue.\r\n\r\n#9344 suggests that the reason for dynamic linking in released versions is because they are installed to system locations that normal users don't have access to change. This is confusing, because this should be a toggle flipped by packagers when building binary packages for release, but instead is (apparently) something enforced in the code in Git. IOW, it's not clear that \"released version\" means \"tagged in Git\" as opposed to \"downloadable release from the web site\".",
