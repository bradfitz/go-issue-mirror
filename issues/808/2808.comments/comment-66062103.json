I also like the\nidea with the build tags.\n\nTwo suggestions:\n\n1\tA build tag \"pathinst\", which will change cmd/go's behaviour\n\tso that it does not install a command into DIR/bin/foo but into \n\tDIR/bin/path/to/package/foo (see below for an example).\n\n2\tA build tag \"singlefilecmd\" (or a better name) which allows multiple\n\tcommands in one directory -- i.e. multiple `func main()'s -- being built\n\tand installed, similar to the pattern Plan 9's mkmany build helper supports.\n\n\t(\"go build\" could create a.prog1, a.prog2 instead of a.out)\n\nThese build tags combined would make it easy for e.g. the go9p project\nto preserve its project structure as it is today: Its example programs\n\tDIR/src/code.google.com/p/go9p/p/clnt/examples/{cl,ls,read,tag,tls,write}.go ,\n\nwhich are all single file commands, could just embed the build tag\n\"pathinst\" and \"singlefilecmd\", and would be built and installed into:\n\n\tDIR/bin/code.google.com/p/go9p/p/clnt/examples/cl\n\tDIR/bin/code.google.com/p/go9p/p/clnt/examples/ls\n\t...\n\nrather than\n\tDIR/bin/cl\n\tDIR/bin/ls\u003c/pre\u003e",
