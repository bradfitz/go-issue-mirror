Esp. since Go is separating the codes and compiling them, it might be a\ngood idea to implicitly mimic C stream flush behavior.\n\nThis can be very confusing for new users and a potential headache for large codebases\nusing mixed languages. Either this needs to be explicitly documented and well publicized\nor it should be taken care of implicitly.\u003c/pre\u003e",
