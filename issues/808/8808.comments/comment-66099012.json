Returning from the Go main function, or calling os.Exit,\ndoes not flush the C streams.  By default C's standard output flushes on newline.  That\nis why you see the behaviour that you do.\n\nI'm not sure whether to consider this a bug in Go or not.  You can work around it by\nexplicitly calling C.fflush(nil) before main returns.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **release-none**._",
