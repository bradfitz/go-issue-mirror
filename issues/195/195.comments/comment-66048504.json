The receiver types for String() on cmyk and Lab are pointers but\nthe fields of color are \nvalues.  Pointer methods do not work for values.  This is in the spec; Effective Go has\na short essay about it.\n\nI changed the type of the methods to be values and the code worked after a little\nadjustment.\n\nI'll add a test to the fmt package to be sure, but it's working fine.  Thanks for taking\nthe time to report the \nproblem; when I read the description I really believed there was a bug and I'm happy to\nhave a test in place now.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Invalid**._",
