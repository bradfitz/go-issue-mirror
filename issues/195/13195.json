The regexp that's supposed to match custom profiles, [`\\A(\\w+) profile: total \\d+\\n\\z`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/321a407/src/cmd/pprof/internal/profile/legacy_profile.go#L22), should match the format described in the runtime/pprof docs.\r\n\r\nThe full variety of import paths may be too much to support, but at the very least '.' and '/' should be allowed.\r\n\r\n\u003e $ go version\r\ngo version devel +321a407 Fri Nov 6 15:16:28 2015 +0000 darwin/amd64",
