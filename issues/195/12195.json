	"body": "As discussed in \r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/Hihyzgci1EU\r\n\r\n\u003e I'd like to use the amazing golang.org/x/net/trace library. Howevever, my HTTP-serving binaries are using the Gorilla Mux for the request routing. \r\n \u003e Unfortunately, the trace package doesn't expose the http.HandleFunc as a public interface, instead registering private methods in the package's init() function to the http.DeafultServerMux.\r\n\r\n@dsymonds mentioned he already had this in his plans and asked for a ticket.",
