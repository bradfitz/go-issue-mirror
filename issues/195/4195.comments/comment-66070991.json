The function does not cancel I/O operations that other\nthreads issue for a file handle\".\n\nIf you have a thread that issues all read operations, and another thread that issues all\nwrite operations, then you can cancel read and write operations separately with\nCancelIo. That's exactly what we need. We have at most 1 pending read and at most 1\npending write, so we do not need finer granularity of cancel.\u003c/pre\u003e",
