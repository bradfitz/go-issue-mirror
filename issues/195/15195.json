	"body": "Terminal methods defined for other GOOSs should be stubbed for plan9 so that tests can be run for all GOOS without failure.\r\n\r\nPlease answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\nIt was Gobot Gobot that failed; assume it is go1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGobot Gobot failed a test for \"plan9-386\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nWhile developing a test for terminal behavior, Gobot Gobot failed due to methods being undefined in plan9.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nTest skipped, either explicitly for plan9 or due to assumption of \"not a terminal\".\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nTest fails due to:\r\n```\r\nundefined: IsTerminal...\r\nundefined: GetState...\r\nundefined: Restore...\r\nundefined: MakeRaw....\r\n```",
