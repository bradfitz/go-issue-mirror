	"body": "I've been cherry-picking changes from master to release-branch.go1.5. When I add Run-TryBot+1 to these cherry-pick CLs, the trybots run according to the \"Trybot state\" section of the farmer status page, but the coordinator never replies to the Gerrit CL.\r\n\r\nAn example CL is https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/17056/1. On the farmer status page, I see a run with the correct Change-ID and commit hash:\r\n\r\n```\r\nChange-ID: Ib11f705ac9194925f63fe5dfbfc84013a38333e6 Commit: 17339f516f72555be25a0faa04fd28b6f50d8548 (status)\r\n   Remain: 0, fails: []\r\n  misc-compile: running=false\r\n  darwin-amd64-10_10: running=false\r\n  linux-386: running=false\r\n  linux-amd64: running=false\r\n  linux-amd64-race: running=false\r\n  freebsd-386-gce101: running=false\r\n  freebsd-amd64-gce101: running=false\r\n  windows-386-gce: running=false\r\n  windows-amd64-gce: running=false\r\n  openbsd-386-gce56: running=false\r\n  openbsd-amd64-gce56: running=false\r\n  plan9-386: running=false\r\n  nacl-386: running=false\r\n  nacl-amd64p32: running=false\r\n  linux-arm: running=false\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis run has finished, but it never replied to the CL. Furthermore, because it didn't reply to the CL, the the TryBot-Result label never got set, so the query in `findTryWork` will keep finding this CL until I upload a new version or submit it.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that this has to do with the reuse of the Change-ID for the cherry-picked commit. However, the commit hash should disambiguate this, and the coordinator code appears to be correctly feeding through the (Change-ID, commit hash) pair when it calls SetReview, so it's not obvious to me what's going wrong. It's possible this is actually a Gerrit bug.\r\n\r\n/cc @bradfitz ",
