The correct version, which doesn't have the scope benefits I mentioned is:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndelayErr, isDelayErr := err.(*CtxDelayErr) // custom error\r\nswitch {\r\ncase err == etcdserver.ErrStopped, err == raft.ErrStopped:\r\n\tfallthrough\r\ncase isGrpc(etcdserver.ErrStopped) || isGrpc(grpc.ErrClientConnClosing):\r\n\tfallthrough\r\ncase isDelayErr:\r\n\r\n\t// DO STUFF\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003e Okay, well I'll close the issue until such time as someone wants to pursue it.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration.\r\n\r\nAs an aside (and I mean this is the most friendly way) I've heard the phrase \"the bar for [language|stdlib|whatever] changes is high\" from others before. I don't think this is the most inviting way to encourage people to contribute and think about how to improve golang. Don't worry, I'm not mad, but it might be a good thing to reconsider for others :) It makes me feel that since I'm not a google employee I wouldn't have an idea that could be worth the consideration of google employees.\r\n\r\nWith respect,\r\nJames",
