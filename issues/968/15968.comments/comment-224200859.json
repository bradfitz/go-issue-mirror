Word on the street is that google has tools that can do this type of analysis on their existing bodies of code. Do you think you could run such an analysis and share the data? Perhaps I've misunderstood what is possible.\r\n\r\n\u003e That said, I don't understand how your initial example could work anyhow.\r\n\r\nSorry about that, I guess I didn't explain clearly. Put another way, the idea is to have a readable case statement which can match many different error conditions, including some that require short declaration to see if the err is of the correct type.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time and keep up the great work! (not sarcasm)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJames",
