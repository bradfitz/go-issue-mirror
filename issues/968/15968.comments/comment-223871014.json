It was more just a general comment to hopefully provide positive reflection because I seem to hear that a lot (whether directed at me or others).\r\n\r\nI guess I don't see golang in the \"late stage\" is all. Only soon-to-be-deprecated is in late state to me :)\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work, I enjoy (most of) your language, thanks!",
