	"body": "First I found this bug on an RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server) 6.6 system in a virtual qemu machine which has 24 virtual processors.\r\n[log-virtual.txt](https://github.com/golang/go/files/91670/log-virtual.txt)\r\n\r\nLinux kernel version is 2.6.32-504.el6.x86_64. Everything used to work on revision 732e2cd which I had previously checked out, so I bisected the problem and found a problematic commits: d513ee774cb3747eccc6b3483a67dbb9118dae8d and f034ee8c22151039465826da0f8c35e9780a8d55. I even created a patch which reverted these two commits and fixed this problem for me on the virtual machine.\r\n[fix-virtual.patch.txt](https://github.com/golang/go/files/91662/fix-virtual.patch.txt)\r\n\r\nBut later I found a RHEL 6.6 system which runs on a physical hardware with 48 processors and without virtual layer, and it tried running tests on it. It happens that tests always crash on this machine. Even revision 732e2cd which used to work for me on virtual machine produces the same result.\r\n[log-physical.txt](https://github.com/golang/go/files/91673/log-physical.txt)\r\n\r\nA similar system running Ubuntu 15.04 (kernel 3.19.0-15-generic) doesn't have any such problems.\r\n\r\nGo bootstrap compiler used in both cases is recently released version 1.5.3.",
