Is this compiler output or final generated code, because I would have expected the linker to do some branch folding if this is the final output.\r\n\r\nI believe the TESTLs are nil checks introduced by the compiler as guarantees that indirections through nil pointers cannot be used to access random memory.\r\n\r\nThe \"register spill\" is putting a value back on the stack. It may be unnecessary but it's hard to tell from this incomplete fragment.\r\n\r\nTo me, this all looks pretty normal.\r\n",
