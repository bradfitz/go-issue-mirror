	"body": "I found a way around this that is even more subtle than I thought after experimentation with our packages in Gentoo. If you add \"/...\" to the end of a repository name, things work as expected, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go get -d -t -u -v golang.org/x/tools/...\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing this makes \"go get\" not complain about non-buildable sources at the top level.\r\n\r\nSo is this just a documentation issue? I didn't see anything about it in \"go help\" anywhere.",
