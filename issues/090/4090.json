(In particular\nit does not need to stop the world.) Perhaps we should have a separate ReadGCStats that\ncan be cheaper. It would be nice to have the tukey summary of the pause list as well as\nthe duration and start time of the most recent pause. The start time may not be recorded\nanywhere right now and need to be added.\u003c/pre\u003e",
