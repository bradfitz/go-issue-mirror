So how do you intend to find the tools on the average user's machine?\r\n\r\nThat said, keytool I believe is part of the JVM, not the Android SDK. It may well be common on the PATH of people with the SDK installed. (Or it may be inferable from some common Java environment variable.) So using it might well work, it just needs to be tried on a relatively light SDK setup.",
