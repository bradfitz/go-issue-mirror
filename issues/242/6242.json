	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIt has been common to use the idiom of limiting a workgroup size by blocking on send to\na buffered chan, where the cap of the chan is set to the desired workgroup size. This\napproach has also been used in the standard library.\n\nHowever there has been discussion in both golang-nuts and golang-dev with comments that\nsuggest that this behaviour is not formally guaranteed to work (although it does in the\ncurrent runtime implementations).\n\nI would be good to have either a guarantee that the idiom is guaranteed to continue to\nwork or that there is no guarantee.\n\nFor further details, see the thread here:\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/wSRqJLvVTzo\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/wSRqJLvVTzo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
