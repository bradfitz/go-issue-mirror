Where exactly would %GOTOOLDIR% be set?\n\n\u003e C:\\go\\src\u003e.\\cmd\\dist\\dist env -wp  1\u003eenv.bat \n\nthis command (.\\cmd\\dist\\dist env -wp) outputs bunch of lines in the form of\n\nset CC=gcc\n\nand similar. GOTOOLDIR is suppose to be amongst them. These suppose to get written to a\ntemp env.bat batch file.\n\n\u003e C:\\go\\src\u003ecall env.bat \n\nHere env.bat is executed, but I don't see it do anything. Is it empty? If yes, then why?\nDoes \".\\cmd\\dist\\dist env -wp\" actually outputs anything? If not, why? You have the\nsource, just put print statements where needed to answer all these questions. Until you\ndiscover the reason.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
