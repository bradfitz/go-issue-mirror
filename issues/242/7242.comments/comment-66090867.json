It appears the xprintf() family of functions are not actually printing\nanything. Investigating that furhter reveals that\n\n\tn = vsnprintf(NULL, 0, fmt, arg);\n\tp = xmalloc(n+1);\n\tvsnprintf(p, n+1, fmt, arg);\n\nis what's not working: p is just set to a zero-length string in every case. I figured\nthe problem was that arg was being reused without being reset, so I tried that, and\npresto - output!\n\nThe solution is that everywhere these three lines exist, va_end and va_start have to be\ncalled again. I don't know if this will introduce any bugs on other systems, though...\nHow would I submit a patch to fix this (if you so wish)? Thanks again!\u003c/pre\u003e",
