I _can_ see why your example code will not work, but I fail to find\nhow it's connected to the example code @2 nor to the related proof it. Therefore I also\ndon't understand how I could do something like \"The same way you can prove that the\nfollowing is a correct mutex.\". \n\nPerhaps you can help me to understand all of the above by pointing out to a specific\nfailure(s) in the previously presented proof. It has only 4 steps/formal legs above the\ninitial conditions, so it should be hopefully easy to do. I'd glad to know where the\nerror is.\u003c/pre\u003e",
