Even if we get past the compiling\nproblems, which should be easy, the low-level system\ncall interface may well be different, which means the\n8.outs are going to be doing the wrong things.\n\nI'd like to see Go running on 10.4 and happy to offer \nadvice, but we're focusing our own implementation\nefforts on more recent systems.\n\nOne good test of how hard it's going to be would be\nto take an OS X binary from a working installation\nand try to run it on 10.4.  If it runs fine, then the \nlow-level stuff is okay and it's probably not too much\nwork just to get everything building.  If it doesn't\nrun, then it's going to be more effort.  I am attaching\na gzipped godoc binary.  After downloading it, make\nsure $GOROOT is set right and run\n\ngunzip \u0026lt; godoc.gz \u0026gt; godoc\nchmod +x godoc\n./godoc -http=:1234\n\nand then visit \u003ca href=\"http://localhost:1234/pkg/fmt/\"\u003ehttp://localhost:1234/pkg/fmt/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIf that works, then 10.4 won't be too hard.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-macosx-10.4**._\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/242/8/godoc.gz\"\u003egodoc.gz\u003c/a\u003e (601542 bytes)",
