I am saying that it might be okay to\ndecide that files using \\r\\n are categorically\nnot standard gofmt style, implying that gofmt\nis correct.  We don't support \\r-only on Macs either.\n\nIf you are sharing code with people on different\ndevelopment environments your tools are all\ndealing with which line endings to use, uselessly.\nOn the other hand, if everyone ran gofmt on\ncheckin, then the files would be in a single canonical\nformat, with nothing to worry about.  This seems\npreferable to making every tool in use anywhere\nknow about \\r\\n just because some developers\nuse Windows.\u003c/pre\u003e",
