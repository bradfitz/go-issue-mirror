That part of my proposal was nothing but a usage example, the changes I\nwant to have in go are described at the top of my post and in this issue.\n\nThat's something I even actively tried to avoid when designing this, I want to have next\nto all functionality in the driver and only change database/sql so the driver can access\nit.\n\nYou are the third one to make that remark, I must have been unclear in my proposal. Any\nsuggestions how I can correct it?\u003c/pre\u003e",
