	"body": "I find the interface a bit weird. My first instinct would have been for the drivers to implement a new method in the database/sql/driver.Rows object they're returning.  This method would return an interface{} which the user of database/sql would then assert to structs or interfaces defined by the driver.  This could be nicer for backwards compatibility as well, since you could check whether the returned object implements a certain interface added later in the driver's life cycle.",
