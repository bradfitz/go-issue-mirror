Now I want to do a few things:\n\n1. Compile all my packages\n2. Compile all my packages and tests and run a few tests\n3. Compile all my packages and commands and link the commands (if you have a large\nnumber of commands, linking takes a while)\n4. Run all package tests\n5. Run all command tests\n6. Commit my changes\n\nThe go tool seems to be missing a way to accomplish this kind of stuff when you're\nsitting in the root of a large project where you can't remember all the package names.\nWith the old Makefiles I could do:\n\n1. make -j16 -C src/pkg\n2. make -j16 -C src/pkg test-compile \u0026\u0026 make -C src/pkg/foo/bar test\n3. make -j16\n4. make -C src/pkg test\n5. make -C src/cmd test\u003c/pre\u003e",
