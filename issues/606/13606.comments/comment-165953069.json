It's fine because they are auxiliary test cases and we already have other test cases in interface_test.go and interface_windows_test.go.\r\n\r\nI have created CL 17993 to test your theory - just to see what tests will fail if I leave Interface.HardwareAddr blank. It appears (https://storage.googleapis.com/go-build-log/74b9c8ae/windows-amd64-gce_e2dcba01.log) only TestInterfaceHardwareAddrWithGetmac fails:\r\n```\r\n--- FAIL: TestInterfaceHardwareAddrWithGetmac (1.13s)\r\n\tnet_windows_test.go:515: unexpected MAC addresses [\"Local Area Connection=00:00:00:00:00:00\"], want [\"Local Area Connection=42:01:0a:f0:00:13\"]\r\nFAIL\r\nFAIL\tnet\t25.539s\r\n```\r\nso if we disable this test, then we can easily regress just like I did in CL 17993.\r\n\r\nI think we need to keep as much of TestInterfaceHardwareAddrWithGetmac as we can.\r\n\r\nAlex",
