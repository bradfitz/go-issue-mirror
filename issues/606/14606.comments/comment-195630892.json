	"body": "I found one small fix that should help some.  Generally the performance difference baffles me.  The generated code looks pretty good, certainly as good as the legacy compiler generates.\r\n\r\nOne problem is that this is a doubly-nested loop where the inner loop count is small.  The SSA optimization for loop entry doesn't trigger on the outer loop.  That's something I intend to get to, I'll open a bug for tracking.\r\n\r\nAnother suspect is branch mispredicts - the old and new compiler lay out code differently.  The fact that the inner loop count is small may contribute.  This is only a suspicion.\r\n",
