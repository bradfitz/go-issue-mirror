It is strange, however, that as you say it\nseems to be assigning t T's type, despite T not being a type itself.\n\nHowever, if we go ahead and just use a straight-up literal we get the following internal\ncompiler error:-\n\npackage main\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar x interface{}\n\tswitch t := x.(type) {\n\tcase 0:\n\t\tt.x = 1\n\t}\n \n}\n\ndefaultlit [9aa5f40]\n.
