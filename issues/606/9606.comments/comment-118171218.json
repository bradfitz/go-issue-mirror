But I think @bradfitz and @minux are on the right track that go should do the same thing on all platforms. I guess you can only argue what readonly means on windows vs. linux. But if the user running the go process has a way to remove the folder, it should just do it, changing read only bits or not.\r\n\r\nCould anyone point to a example work around how to clear the read all properties? Do i need to recurse the whole .git folder or just spesific files? I would recon there are mad amount of files in .git (depending on the repo ofc).\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Sorry was too hasty, the linked CL diffs had the work around via cmd.exe",
