That would disallow all portable interfaces and languages which abstracted over per-CPU and per-OS differences.\r\n\r\nThe whole point of having a high-level language and package like \"os\" is to let me do things consistently over many operating systems and architectures and knowing it'll work the same everywhere.\r\n\r\nIf I wanted Windows' DeleteFile semantics, I'd use syscall.DeleteFile directly. But I don't. I want os.Remove semantics, like I'm used to everywhere else.\r\n",
