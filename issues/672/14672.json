	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n`go version go1.5.3 linux/amd64`\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n```GOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/home/bongo/dev/go\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/usr/lib/golang\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/usr/lib/golang/pkg/tool/linux_amd64\"\r\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\"\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nI ran the following code: http://play.golang.org/p/sujhjFG8W2\r\n\r\nand did a tcpdump in parallel looking for packages containing my local ipv4 that should be used for connecting:\r\n```\r\nsudo tcpdump -n ip host 192.168.0.99\r\n[sudo] password for bongo: \r\ntcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode\r\nlistening on wlp3s0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n  * There should be packages showing up in tcpdump\r\n  * the \"actual ip used\" line should show a IPv4 address and **not** IPv6\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n  * \"actual ip used\" line shows my public v6 address as used for connection\r\n  * there are no packages showing up using the forced LocalAddr as source\r\n\r\n6. What do you wish?\r\nI wish that\r\n  * forcing of LocalAddr is effective\r\n  * it's possible to assign **multiple** LocalAddrs (one for v4 one for v6) since I want to use a forced address other than the default one also if a host is available on v6 (dual stack/fallback)\r\n  * the design of http.Transport and on a lower level net.Dialer is not in a way that forcing v4 or v6 only connectivity is possible (at least I tried hard to find a way that's exposed and did not manage to), this should be made possible \r\n\r\n7. What do you suspect to be the reason for this behaviour?\r\nI believe that somewhere in the source of the *net/http* library a hardcoded \"tcp\" automatically chooses IPv6 for connecting though it definitely shouldn't...\r\n",
