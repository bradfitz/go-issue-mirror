We have large-exponent values (unlikely), and for the BenchmarkAppendFloatLarge2-48 we have a slow-path:\r\n\r\nIn genericFtoa, we end up calling bigFtoa which uses slow bignum arithmetic. In bigFtoa, the call to roundShortest fails to return quickly, and it proceeds doing the slow (but precise) binary-to-decimal mantissa conversion (ftoa.go:257ff).\r\n\r\nProbably not worth spending much time on fixing this.",
