	"body": "Yes, I think a documentation update is required. Some additional comments:\r\n\r\n * Can I now have a Go compiler installation that can produce both ARM5, ARM6 and ARM7 binaries? That is, does a `GOARM=5 make.bash` compilation overwrite a `GOARM=6 make.bash` compilation, or not?\r\n * Shouldn't the error in 212ce41 appear if I run a ARM6 binary on ARM5, instead of segfaulting? Or was that error removed later on, and the expected behavior is now a segfault (like it was before)?\r\n * I see many build scripts and blog posts that assume that the matrix created iterating on GOOS and GOARCH is enough to create all binary versions of the Go compiler; for instance, the [Homebrew formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/go.rb) assumes that `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm\u0010` is enough to create a fully-functional ARM cross-compiler, while that's not true anymore.\r\n",
