	"body": "Hello, I have a program, written for a specific Linux-ARM5 board, whose cpuinfo is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProcessor\t: ARM926EJ-S rev 5 (v5l)\r\nBogoMIPS\t: 56.52\r\nFeatures\t: swp half fastmult edsp java\r\nCPU implementer\t: 0x41\r\nCPU architecture: 5TEJ\r\nCPU variant\t: 0x0\r\nCPU part\t: 0x926\r\nCPU revision\t: 5\r\n\r\nHardware\t: Bluegiga APX4 Development Kit\r\nRevision\t: 9050003\r\nSerial\t\t: 000000004d9ec28b\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe program appears to work with Go 1.2, while it segfaults at startup (illegal instruction) with 1.3 and 1.4. After closer testing, it appears related to whether the Go compiler is compiled with `GOARM=5` or not, even if we always pass `GOARM=5` at `go build` time. In fact, documentation is a little fuzzy on details; I always assumed that whatever you pass during `make.bash` is just a default, that can be overriden during `go build`.\r\n\r\nThis is the result matrix of my tests:\r\n\r\n * Go 1.2: `GOARM=5 ./make.bash` followed by `GOARM=5 go build`: **SUCCESS**\r\n * Go 1.2: `./make.bash` followed by `GOARM=5 go build`: **SUCCESS**\r\n * Go 1.3+: `GOARM=5 ./make.bash` followed by `GOARM=5 go build`: **SUCCESS**\r\n * Go 1.3+: `./make.bash` followed by `GOARM=5 go build`: **SIGILL**\r\n\r\nI ran `git bisect` and found out that this change in behavior was introduced by the commit 4230044. So before that commit, I can avoid using `GOARM=5` while building the Go compiler, and produce working binaries; after that commit, I need to pass `GOARM=5` while building the Go compiler, otherwise the binaries don't work.\r\n\r\nNotice that in all my testing I never saw the nice error message introduced in 212ce41. Maybe the fact that this message is not shown is part of this bug, or maybe it's just a different orthogonal bug, but I thought it was worth mentioning.",
