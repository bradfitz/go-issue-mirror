At this point it is safe to pass it through, so I'll send a CL to do that.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am a little bit surprised by the behavior of the Go 1.5 beta. Downloading the darwin/amd64 version and putting it anywhere other than /usr/local/go does not go well:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go1.5beta/bin\r\n$ go env\r\ngo: cannot find GOROOT directory: /usr/local/go\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me if this should work.",
