Using the same go version, test server,\nand operating system, I recreated the issue. I'm attaching the dump (for real this\ntime). I don't know the most common format for these files, this was saved using the\nwireshark/tcpdump/libpcap option in the wireshark gui.\n\nMy interpretation is that the initial handshake succeeds, some application data is sent,\nand there is some sort of problem on connection teardown. Please let me know if there's\nanything else I can do to help.\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3819/2/bad_ssl_wireshark_capture\"\u003ebad_ssl_wireshark_capture\u003c/a\u003e (4118 bytes)",
