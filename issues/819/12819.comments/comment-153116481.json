Then ```gomobile bind``` can compare a hash of the newly generated .java against the old, and only touch the .aar if either the .java has changed, or the generated .so would have changed.\r\n\r\nThis avoids adding a flag for a working directory, which I consider important as keeping and reusing intermediate data introduces a new way you can get incorrect builds.",
