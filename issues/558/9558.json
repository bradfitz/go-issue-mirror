	"body": "Some packages that my code depends on went through breaking changes, which caused the disappearance of \"github.com/gonum/blas/goblas\". When I build my code, I get the error \r\n````\r\nbrendan:~/Documents/mygo/src/github.com/reggo/reggo/supervised/nnet$ go test \r\ngo build github.com/gonum/blas/goblas: no buildable Go source files in /Users/brendan/Documents/mygo/src/github.com/gonum/blas/goblas\r\nFAIL\tgithub.com/reggo/reggo/supervised/nnet [build failed]\r\n````\r\nWhich is exactly the error one would expect. However, there is no explicit dependence of supervised/nnet on gonum/blas/goblas, and I had to manually hunt through the import path to find the actual dependency. Could this error be enhanced to show which package tries to import a non-existant package? I'm thinking something along the lines of \r\n````\r\ngo build github.com/gonum/blas/goblas: no buildable Go source files in \r\n/Users/brendan/Documents/mygo/src/github.com/gonum/blas/goblas\r\n (imported by /Users/brendan/Documents/mygo/src/github.com/reggo/reggo/common/regtest)\r\n````",
