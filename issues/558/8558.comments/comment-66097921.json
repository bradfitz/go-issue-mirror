A map\niteration produces a sequence of map entries, but once it gets to an entry and executes\nthe loop body then it is finished with that entry; it won't produce it again for the\nsame reason that it won't produce duplicate map entries without any deletions.\n\nThe spec describes the cases for mutating the map, specifically deleting an entry that\nhasn't been seen yet (it won't yield it) and adding an entry (it might yield it).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **documentation**._\n\n_Owner changed to @griesemer._",
