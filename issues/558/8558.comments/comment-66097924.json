The suggested change doesn't work, since\nthere is no \"current\" entry--there are no iterators here.  I think what you are asking\nfor is something like \"range over map will not break in a surprising manner\" but I don't\nsee why it is necessary to state that explicitly.  Ranging over a map works.  It's\nnecessary to explain what happens with a new entry or a deleted entry that has not yet\nbeen seen, because those cases are not obvious.  It's not necessary to explain what\nhappens for a deleted entry that has already been seen; that case is obvious.\u003c/pre\u003e",
