No matter what file you compile, you're\nnot going to end up with a binary that can debug a Windows program,\nbecause it's a Linux binary and won't run on Windows.\n\nI imagine that if you're running under cygwin to do the build,\nuname will be cygwin and someone will write the appropriate\ncode to do debugging on cygwin.  In that case uname is still\nthe right choice.\u003c/pre\u003e",
