For example, you can set \nGOOS=freebsd on Linux and build a set of compilers that build FreeBSD executables, \nbut if you try to compile the freebsd code for prof and cov it won't compile, because \nonly the Linux headers are available.  Put a different way, prof and cov don't use \n$GOOS for the same reason that the build of 6g doesn't.\n\nWe'll add mingw to the $GOOS listing once the Windows port is complete.  As yet it is \nnot.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
