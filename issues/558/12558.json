	"body": "As noted in #12076 Getpagesize doesn't currently return the actual system's default page size, but rather a hard-coded value.  Per the discussion with @ianlancetaylor on golang-dev [1], the opinion was that syscall.Getpagesize should return the same value as the POSIX call sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE).\r\n\r\nThis change will be necessary for future platform support on Solaris.\r\n\r\nWhile this change could be generally applied (more than likely) to all other POSIX platforms, I'm only planning on making this change for Solaris for now.\r\n\r\nThis issue is being filed to track the change against golang/go separately from x/sys/unix.\r\n\r\nWhile it may be viewed as related to #10180, I believe it can be resolved independently.\r\n\r\n[1] https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/ZLzxYzULzU8",
