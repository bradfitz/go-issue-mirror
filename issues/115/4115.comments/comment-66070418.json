When\nyou send signals like (SIGINT, SIGKILL) from the menu in putty, nothing happens.\n\nAfter scanning the putty code I realized they are actually just sending a character when\nyou press Ctrl+C.\n\nThe section \"VINTR\" on \u003ca href=\"http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl3_termios.htm\"\u003ehttp://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl3_termios.htm\u003c/a\u003e confirmed\nthis.\n\nConclusion:\n1) in.Write(\"\\x03\") does what I need.\n\n2) Lesson learned: Read documentation.\n\nRFC 4254 SSH Connection Protocol states: Some systems may not implement signals, in\nwhich case they SHOULD ignore this message.\u003c/pre\u003e",
