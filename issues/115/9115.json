	"body": "by **gima@iki.fi**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIt doesn't seem to be possible to limit http client't response header size.\n\nI think this is important, as if a maliciously behaving server responds with too big\nheaders, it would eat away the client's memory. So, the client's response header size\nshould be limitable with some safe default, just the way it is for http server's request\nheaders.\n\nThis appears to be the place where the reading of the headers is done in one-go:\n\u0026gt; 591  func ReadRequest(b *bufio.Reader) (req *Request, err error) {\n\u0026gt; ...\n\u0026gt; 642      mimeHeader, err := tp.ReadMIMEHeader()\n\u0026gt; ...\n\u003ca href=\"https://tip.golang.org/src/net/http/request.go#L642\"\u003ehttps://tip.golang.org/src/net/http/request.go#L642\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n(Hopefully I didn't miss anything that'd void my claim :)\u003c/pre\u003e",
