	"body": "Allow meta tags in 'go get' to specify a branch. Suggested syntax from  discussion at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/SW8r9ODYQf0/kqofheawGWYJ\r\n\r\n    \u003cmeta name=\"go-import\" content=\"qpid.apache.org/proton git https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/qpid-proton.git/proton-c/bindings/go branch=go1\"\u003e\r\n\r\nRationale: there are several reasons why you might want go get to retrieve from a branch that is not \"master\", \"trunk\" or the default branch for a repository.\r\n\r\n- master/trunk usually used for development, a project may want direct \"go get\" to get the latest stable release or snapshot on a branch or tag.\r\n- make \"experimental\" work available from a branch before it is considered stable/mature enough to move to the project's main branch.\r\n- some repos have odd branch naming conventions for historical reasons (e.g. git repos that were converted from SVN and still use \"trunk\" instead of \"master\")",
