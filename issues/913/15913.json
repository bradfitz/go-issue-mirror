	"body": "Lots of places in cmd/compile, we do:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nsetlineno(n)\r\nYyerror(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSometimes we forget `setlineno`, and the error ends up on the wrong line, or it ends up on the right line but only because the global line number happens to be correct. Sometimes we do `yyerrorl(n.Lineno` instead, but that ignores the special handling found in `setlineno`; yyerrorl is really meant for use in the lexer, before we have a well-formed AST to work from. And the global line number will have to go away as part of #15756.\r\n\r\nThis issue is a reminder to myself to add `yyerrorn` that just wraps setlineno; Yyerror early in Go 1.8 and attempt to use it throughout the tree.\r\n",
