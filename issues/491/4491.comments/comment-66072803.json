From the moment I attached strace to the process\nuntil that process exited with the SIGHUP, there is no other occurence of SIGHUP.\n\nHowever, I'm running it again for the complete execution using strace [command]. So far,\nit's still running but there is one occurrence of SIGHUP so far:\n\n31934 13:20:09.433071 rt_sigaction(SIGHUP, {0x41c505, ~[],\nSA_RESTORER|SA_STACK|SA_RESTART|SA_SIGINFO, 0x41c563}, NULL, 8) = 0\u003c/pre\u003e",
