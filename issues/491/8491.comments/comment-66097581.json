It uses a lot of memory, because it parses\nmulti-part form in memory, and, if large file is part of that form, then\nParseMultipartForm will use as much memory as you've allowed. You have allowed to go up\nto (128 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 20) bytes. So ParseMultipartForm tries to get as much memory as\npossible on your computer.\n\nYou use windows/386 version of Go, so your total runtime heap is about 500M, so you\ndon't have much when you are playing with 300M files. You cannot increase heap, because\nyour OS allows for max of 2G virtual address space, and you need to fit many other\nthings apart from Go runtime heap.\n\nI think your program behaves as expected. But I will let Brad to make that decision. He\nwrote this code, so he might have better suggestions.\n\nSorry.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **New**._",
