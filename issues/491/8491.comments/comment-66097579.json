So Go cannot allocate a lot of memory. If you try to run\nwindows/amd64 (64-bit) version of Go, the limit is much high. So it should not crash as\nquickly.\n\n@Brad, in your opinion, how much memory should that server use under described\nconditions? I don't have time to investigate it properly now. Thank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
