	"body": "If zerovalue is local, a map miss will copy from the zerovalue of the module that defines the type, and that zerovalue is the size of the largest type seen in a map among the packages that go into that module. It's easy to make this go wrong -- put a large type but no use of it into a module and then link another module against it that puts this large type into a map.  66719bc822fa7f9f8d25f8cff0f28848b0f24b90 makes zerovalue local and also contains a test that fails with that change. (A slightly different test with TortureZeroValue in zvtlib rather than the exe fails on tip).",
