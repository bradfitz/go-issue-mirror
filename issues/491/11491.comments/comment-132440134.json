	"body": "So I started to implement the idea of having the map code return a pointer to a fixed size buffer of zeros on a miss and I've gotten stuck. In particular, I don't see the best way of handling the miss case for OINDEXMAP. Basicallly I don't know what to rewrite OINDEXMAP into when the value type is large: the access needs to turn into code like\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar tmp1 T\r\ntmp2 := p(key)\r\nif tmp2 == runtime.zeroptr {\r\n    tmp1 = T{}\r\n} else {\r\n    tmp1 = *tmp2\r\n}\r\n\"return\" tmp1\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut that's really a statement, and a map index is obviously an expression. This sort of expansion is clearly done by function inlining, but I don't know how to do that in walkexpr :/",
