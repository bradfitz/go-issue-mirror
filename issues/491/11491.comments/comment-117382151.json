	"body": "I'm not sure this is a problem.  The size is not associated with the size put into the map, it is associated with the size read during a map access.  So any package that looks up in a map[K]V must have a zero value of size at least V.  I believe the code does that correctly, as long as the linker does the maximum size calculation for each zerovalue in each shared library.\r\n\r\nI think you might be right that this is no longer used for 2-arg type casts.",
