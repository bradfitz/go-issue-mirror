	"body": "Using Go 1.5.3 on Linux/amd64:\r\n\r\nWriting a file like:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nerr := ioutil.WriteFile(\"temp\", []byte(\"foo\"), 0644)\r\nif err != nil {\r\n\t// error handling\r\n}\r\n// read \"temp\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nReading the file content of `temp` immediately after writing it sometimes indicates the content hasn't been written to the file. Looking at the source code of [`WriteFile`](https://golang.org/src/io/ioutil/ioutil.go?s=2520:2588#L66) it seems like a call to `Sync()` is missing.\r\n\r\nP.S.: Tested with larger content.",
