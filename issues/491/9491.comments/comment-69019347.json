For example,\r\nthe os/exec test was passing before we removed `*nomp=`.\r\n\r\nI'm also experiencing some issues when connected on\r\nthe Plan 9 instance on GCE using cpu(1). For example,\r\nwhen I try to run `rio` or `cat /bin/cpurc`, the network\r\nconnection to tcp/17010 becomes frozen. A TCP segment from\r\nGCE got lost, then it doesn't receive any segment any longer.\r\nThis is always the same symptom.\r\n\r\nIt might be related to an issue in the Virtio network driver.\r\nHowever, it doesn't seem you have encountered these issues on\r\nyour side since you ran rio successfully.\r\n\r\nI've just tried to run a n1-highcpu-4 instance with\r\nmultiprocessing disabled and ran all.rc in ramfs.\r\nIt went fine up to the runtime test, then the network\r\nconnection broke.",
