Is it Plan 9, Go on Plan 9, or Plan 9 on GCE that's slow?\r\n\r\nThe Plan 9 file systems are usually slow, but this is amplified in virtual environments.\r\n\r\n\u003e @0intro, I'll buy you a beer in compensation for the n1-highcpu-2.\r\n\r\nThanks. I hope it will be a good American IPA :-)\r\n\r\n\u003e Was starting all the processors (it's not automatic?) the solution that\r\n\u003e makes the runtime tests fast enough to finish in under 2 minutes?\r\n\r\nOnly the first processor is enabled by default, because it could\r\ncause issues on some machines. Since it seems to work fine,\r\nI've removed `*nomp=` from the plan9.ini.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure it's enough to get rid of that issue however.",
