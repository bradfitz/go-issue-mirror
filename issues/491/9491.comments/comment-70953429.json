Is Plan 9 able to clamp/tweak/adjust outgoing TCP MSS options in SYN segments? Doesn't Plan 9 support any TCP options including MSS/WScale/SACK/etc? Perhaps you need to count the size of TCP options. \r\n\r\nWhat happens if DEF_MSS of Plan 9 takes a value between 1280 and 1400?\r\n```\r\n1280: lower bound of IPv6 link MTU\r\n1340: GCE's link MTU - (maximum IPv4 header length + maximum TCP header length)\r\n1400: GCE's link MTU - (usual IPv4 header length  + maximum TCP header length)\r\n```",
