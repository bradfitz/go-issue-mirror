Maybe that doesn't help on a 32-bit plan9.  But 2GB of memory should be fine even, no?\r\n\r\n\u003e but this is amplified in virtual environments.\r\n\r\nNot sure why (no virtio?), but okay.\r\n\r\nI downloaded drawterm from the swtch.com site and ran ./drawterm-osx-intel -a $IP -c $IP -u glenda with the glenda123 password.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm still confused why it works fine when I run the tests by hand, but fails for being too slow under the buildlet.\r\n",
