	"body": "I think MTU path discovery is why you can download files into your GCE VM. The sending side (bell-labs.com) knows what size to send you. Maybe GCE replies with the ICMP responses to tell it the proper sizes.\r\n\r\nBut when your VM tries to send packets, if it writes one too large, it disappears.\r\n\r\nThe Linux VM gets the MTU of 1460 via a DHCP extension. Plan 9's DHCP doesn't do that.\r\n\r\nBut you said you tweaked another host's MTU to make it work? That doesn't scale. :) We have to figure out how to tell Plan 9 to write the correct size IP packets.\r\n\r\nAlso, that doesn't even sound like it works: I failed to download a file from Plan9-\u003eLinux when both were on GCE, with the Linux MTU set to 1460 and Plan 9 also thought it was 1460.\r\n\r\nI'm increasingly thinking the MTU isn't the problem by itself and Plan 9 has some other networking issues happening on GCE.\r\n",
