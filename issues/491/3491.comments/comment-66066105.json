You can start a new branch\nfrom that point if you wish, but that's not what happens when you check out a tag.  It's\nshowing you the state of the files at a particular point in time, and anyone checking\nout that tag at any point in history should wind up with the same files (git tags are\nnot supposed to move).\n\nIn git, branches are primarily used for development, and they are essentially a local\nentity.  You can push them and pull them, but this only pushes and pulls the branch's\nhead as a special sort of tag.  When you check out a remote branch, you are also not\nactually on a branch, though the operation can optionally create a local tracking branch\nwith the same name.\u003c/pre\u003e",
