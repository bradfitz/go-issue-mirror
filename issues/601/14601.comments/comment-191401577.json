Also, what is the algorithmic complexity of select if there are lots of channels?\r\n\r\nIt also complicates adding or removing producers after the consumers have been started, as each consumer needs to be notified of the additional producer channel and keep track of which producers have stopped.\r\n\r\nIn essence, that solution scales linearly with M and N, where reference counts are constant.",
