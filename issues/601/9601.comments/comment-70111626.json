	"body": "As you probably know, this doesn't work because struct in6_addr has no field named s6_addr.  Instead, the header file has\r\n\r\n#define s6_addr\t\t\t__in6_u.__u6_addr8\r\n\r\nSo if we are going to fix this, the fix would be to somehow get cgo to recognize defined macro names when they are used as field names.  I don't think this is likely to happen any time soon, but I will leave the issue open since it would be nice if it worked.",
