	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.7rc5 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"darwin\"\r\nGOOS=\"darwin\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n`go install`  a binary named `go`.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nA warning.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n`go` binary was populated in  `$GOPATH/bin`.\r\nSince I have `$GOPATH/bin` at the end my `$PATH` I have not noticed anything.\r\nSome make files/buildscripts add inferred `GOPATH/bin` in front of `$PATH`, which leads to surprising behavior when they do `go build` later.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a security risk: my system becomes vulnerable if I do `go get` targeting a bad package (or a good package that got hacked), even if I do not run/test the code.\r\nImagine malicious binary that intercepts regular `go` commands and injects some code.\r\n",
