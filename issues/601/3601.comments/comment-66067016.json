But maybe U.S.\nEnglish and British English are subtly different. Anyway, the way I read it is that\n'simple' in the context of the sentence is not about simplicity (easy to understand,\nthat kind of thing), but about simpleness (only basic programs that can't do much).\n\nIf you won't change 'simple' to 'maintainable' what about changing it to\n'understandable'?\n\n(Anyway, I won't raise this again:-)\u003c/pre\u003e",
