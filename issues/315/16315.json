What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\ndarwin\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nvcs.RepoRootForImportPath(\"bitbucket.org/XXXx/privaterepo\",true)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nThe repo root.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nErrors with `https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/XXXx/privaterepo: 403 Forbidden`\r\n\r\nThis is because it tries to ping w/o any auth info. This info can be provided via .netrc and/or git. `go get` doesn't have a problem fetching a private repo though.",
