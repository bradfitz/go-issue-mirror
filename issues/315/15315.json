	"body": "The documentation (both for 1.6 at https://golang.org/cmd/go/ and for tip at https://tip.golang.org/cmd/go/) for `go test` says that\r\n\r\n\u003e 'Go test' recompiles each package along with any files with names matching the file pattern \"*_test.go\".\r\n\r\nHowever the documentation for `go build` doesn't say anything about `_test.go` files.\r\n\r\nI think the documentation for `go build` and `go install` should be updated to mention that `_test.go` files are ignored.\r\n\r\nWhile most users probably do not read the documentation carefully it is still useful to have something to refer new users to.
