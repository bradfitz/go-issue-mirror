Also, looking at the source code for \"pack -P\", I don't see that it\ncan handle windows paths. I am surprised we didn't see any complains about that, but I\nlogged an issue \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/5550\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/5550\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nWhat about making linker do the job?\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
