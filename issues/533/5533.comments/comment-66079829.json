I have GOROOT set when I build the executable.\nShouldn't \"go build\" use GOROOT value and set all debug info accordingly? As far as I\ncan see, it uses whatever values were set when package binaries were created. That is\nthe purpose of GOROOT_FINAL. Isn't it? But it doesn't work very well in this situation.\nPerhaps, we could just make linker smarter and drop GOROOT_FINAL altogether.\n\nI suspect I miss something here. So help me please. Tank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
