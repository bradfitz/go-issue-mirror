If they are installed elsewhere then things don't work as well. In\nparticular, source line information is wrong for the compiled packages. I don't think we\nintend to change that.\n\nI just wrote godoc.org/code.google.com/p/rsc/cmd/editpcln that edits the pcln tables for\nGo 1.3 archives. You could use it to download a binary Go 1.3 distribution and replace\n/usr/local/go with a different prefix. Since we're just shipping tar files, I doubt we\nwould include this in the Unix distributions, but perhaps it would make sense in the\nWindows distributions. (Or perhaps not.)\n\nIf nothing else, something to keep in mind for Go 1.4.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: removed **os-windows**._",
