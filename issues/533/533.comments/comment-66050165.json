I'm happy to run with this\npatch; I'm also happy to review it and offer suggestions if you'd like to work on\nthis functionality via codereview. See \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/contribute.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/contribute.html\u003c/a\u003e if\nyou're interested -- otherwise let me know and I'll hammer your patch into something\n`fuller'.\u003c/pre\u003e",
