Create a type that satisfies os.Reader but the Read() function doesn't return os.EOF\nat the end of the 'file'.\n2. Create an instance of the struct and run ioutil.ReadAll() on it.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nioutil.ReadAll() should return a []byte with whatever Read() returns.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nIt goes into an infinite loop due to the fact that io.Copy() won't end cleanly without\ngetting an os.EOF.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThis could be fixed by having Reader need an EOF() function that tells whether or not\nthe end of the file has been reached yet, or by making a separate interface that has\nio.Reader and an EOF() function.\n\nI've included an example that has the problem.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1533/0/test.go\"\u003etest.go\u003c/a\u003e (692 bytes)",
