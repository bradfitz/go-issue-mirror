Instead, we reworked the\nbuild scripts to use bash and GNU make always, so that we need only\nworry about portability across different versions of a single program.\n\nAs of \u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=692ac2ced6f7\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=692ac2ced6f7\u003c/a\u003e\nthe build process should run on BSD machines as long as bash and\ngmake are installed in one of the standard locations, so that should\nbe a help.\n\nI expect that FreeBSD support will be checked in tomorrow or the\nnext day (it is very close to working); perhaps that will be a useful\nstarting point for OpenBSD.  You can follow \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/166\"\u003eissue #166\u003c/a\u003e for more.\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/166\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/166\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI'm not going to list the m4 dependency in the package documentation,\nsince that is only an indirect dependency due to Bison, not a direct\ndependency of Go.\n\nI would certainly be interested to know about and correct a dependency\nof godefs on gcc 4.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Fixed**._",
