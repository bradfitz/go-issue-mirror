It buffers runes but it is supposed to be returning a UTF-8 sequence of bytes, so in the case `utf8.RuneLen(r) \u003e len(b)` when `n == 0 \u0026\u0026 len(b) \u003e 0` it needs to break up `r` into a byte sequence, return the bytes that fit into `b`, and buffer the remaining bytes for the next call.",
