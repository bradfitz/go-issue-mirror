	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eSince we are actively working on precise GC with the goal of 100% precision. It's a good\nidea to have some GC precision tests. E.g. allocate a heap block, set finalizer for it,\ncast the pointer to uintptr, spray the value to locals/arguments/globals/heap/etc, call\nGC, ensure that the block is still collected. Later when we discover/fix new corner\ncases, we will be able to test them as well.\u003c/pre\u003e",
