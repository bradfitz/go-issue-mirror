I cannot think of why yours get go.tools in it. But it should not\nbe difficult to determine. cmd/dist writes into the file, so if you use xprintf in\ncmd/dist to print what is happening step by step, you should be able to determine what\nis wrong. Please, have a go and report back here.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
