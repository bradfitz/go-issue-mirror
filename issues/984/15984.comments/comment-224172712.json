	"body": "The intent is to enable packages which live outside the standard library to gain access to the runtime network poller, and to avoid having to duplicate the functionality of the poller externally.\r\n\r\nFor example, I've written an [ethernet sockets package](https://github.com/mdlayher/raw), but because I can't use the network poller to determine when the socket has data available, my options are to either:\r\n- not support timeouts at all (blocking socket I/O)\r\n- run in a loop and keep checking for `EAGAIN`\r\n- implement custom socket polling using platform-specific mechanisms like `epoll`, `kqueue`, etc.\r\n\r\nIdeally, third party libraries should be able to create sockets which can take advantage of Go's network poller.
