Probably timing issues.\r\n* As I reduce the number of fields in `Response`, the bug gets harder to trigger.\r\n* If I don't return the string from `run()`, the bug hardly triggers any more, but I've still seen it.\r\n* If I replace the `done` callback by a simple channel, the bug disappears.\r\n* The string building in the test seems to be necessary, but just to get garbage collection going.\r\n",
