If you think about the compilation step separately, though, you see\n\ngccgo -c main.go\n\nNow where should main import usb from?  Since you didn't tell it to import from the\ncurrent directory, it looks in the system library directories.  Adding -I . should fix\nthe problem.  Let me know if that helps.\u003c/pre\u003e",
