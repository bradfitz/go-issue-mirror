	"title": "proposal: support custom method names in net/rpc",
	"body": "I'm converting a legacy system that uses json-rpc into Go, and I have some restrictions on the method names that don't work with Go's RPC layer. The legacy method names are all lowercase and do not have a namespace structure \"method_name\". Go's RPC layer wants to use \"Class.Method\" as the method name. It would be very useful to be able to either a) provide a  mapping of method names when registering a handler or b) register individual methods with a custom name.\r\n\r\nSomething like this, as taken from the net/rpc package example:\r\n\r\n```\r\narith := new(Arith)\r\nrpc.RegisterWithNames(arith, map[string]string{\r\n    \"mul\": \"Arith.Multiply\",\r\n    \"div\": \"Arith.Divide\",\r\n})\r\n\r\n// or\r\n\r\nrpc.RegisterMethod(\"mul\", Arith.Multiply)\r\nrpc.RegisterMethod(\"div\", Arith.Divide)\r\n```\r\n",
