See http://golang.org/src/go/build/build.go?s=15254:15344#L449\n\nIf I have a package in my GOPATH go/build.Import works for it. If the package is in the vendor/ directory it doesn't and I wasn't sure the best way to make a vendor/ directory work with go/build. Any pointers would be appreciated.\n\nOn Friday, August 21, 2015 at 2:45:12 PM UTC-4, rsc wrote:\nOn Fri, Aug 21, 2015 at 1:40 PM, Matt Farina \u003cmatt....@gmail.com\u003e wrote:\nI noticed the go/build package doesn't work with vendor/ imports. The vendor code was kept in in the go cmd codebase which, I don't think, is available for packages.\nIs this a bug? Should the go/build package be able to work with vendor/ imports?\n\ngo/build does not know about source code layout, directories, and the like. It just reports what is contained in a set of specified files. In particular, it does not resolve imports. It doesn't tell you whether an imported package exists, for example.\n\nWas there a particular API in go/build that you think should change behavior for vendored imports?\n\nThanks.\nRuss\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"golang-dev\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to golang-dev+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/optout.",
