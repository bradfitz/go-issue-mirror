I have a proposal; feedback would be most\nwelcome.\n\n(0) Following @rsc's patch, do the following per set of consecutive imports.\n(1) Sort by import path, then import name, then comment. (Currently, gofmt sorts only by\nimport path.)\n(2) For imports A, B, if they have the same import path and import name, and A's comment\nis a prefix of B's comment, then remove import A. This handles: (a) exact duplicates,\n(b) B has a comment and A doesn't, and (c) A's comment has had extra info added to it.\n\nFor example:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/1tVBooLtPy\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/1tVBooLtPy\u003c/a\u003e\n\nwould become:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/2NV45hJpPY\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/2NV45hJpPY\u003c/a\u003e\n\nNote that no attempt is made to combine significantly different comments. Reasoning:\n\n* I believe that this case will be uncommon (admittedly based only on anecdotal\nevidence).\n* I was unable to find a proposal that looked obviously right to me, and as @rsc points\nout, there are lots of corner cases. Under those circumstances, requiring human\nintervention seems reasonable.\n* Such combining could yet be added in the future if the right approach became clear.\u003c/pre\u003e",
