	"body": "While hacking on a medium sized golang project, I've found that certain things seem to cause my program to terminate, but without any trace or exit code. I'm assuming this is a golang bug, since there's no clear reason why the program would exit without reason.\r\n\r\nI've got a binary that I compiled that experiences this, and I can reproduce it on other machines.\r\n\r\nI'm running golang:\r\ngo version go1.5.4 linux/amd64\r\nOn Fedora 23.\r\n\r\nIf this is a known issue someone can point me to, I'd appreciate it, otherwise please let me know what I can run to debug this.\r\n\r\nHere is the output of my most recent terminate:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./mgmt run\r\n06:12:56 main.go:65: This is: mgmt, version: 0.0.3-48-ga89c332-dirty\r\n06:12:56 main.go:66: Main: Start: 1464516776777766845\r\n06:12:56 main.go:120: Main: Seeds: No seeds specified!\r\n06:12:56 etcd.go:344: Etcd: Bootstrapping...\r\n06:12:56 etcd.go:1089: Trace: Etcd: nominateCallback()\r\n06:12:56 asm_amd64.s:438: Trace: Etcd: nominateCallback(): Finished!\r\n$ echo $?\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf particular note is that the last line contains the contents of a log.Printf command, which is some debugging text I put there, but it doesn't happen at asm_amd64.s:438 (I've enabled logging of file and line numbers)\r\n\r\nThanks for your time, and I'm happy to post the binary if anyone is interested.",
