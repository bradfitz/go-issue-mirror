Hopefully there wasn't any caching at play here.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should stamp the Docker container hash into the VM image and make it print itself during rc.local (if that goes to the serial console?) so at least when we debug from the GCE serial console logs, we then see which Docker image it came from.  It should probably also include the docker2boot version as well.  Interested in making those additions to docker2boot?\r\n\r\nI'll work on whittling down my *-sid additions to the minimum set of packages which work, and disabling the logind service.",
