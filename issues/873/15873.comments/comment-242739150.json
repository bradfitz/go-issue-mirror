	"body": "Our issue was, in fact, unrelated to this. The shutdown messages were just hidden in front of hundreds of warnings in the log, as execution was terminating and closing everything down. The reason for the shutdown was an unexpected signal other than SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP being issued, and us deciding to catch all signals. After we stopped catching the signal, the software stopped \"crashing\". We still don't know what issued the signal, since we found nothing in OS logs.",
