It's blocked [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/dfbbe06a205e7048a8541c4c97b250c24c40db96/src/database/sql/sql.go#L811) when trying to acquire a connection from pool. A `select` with a `context.Done()` channel could help here, that is a timeout for waiting a connection from connection pool. And I think a timeout error is a standard behavior when the connection pool is full and busy in other database drivers.",
