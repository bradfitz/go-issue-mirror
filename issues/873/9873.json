	"body": "I tried to convert the linux-x86-sid Dockerfile to produce a VM, like the -std and -clang Dockerfiles, but as of -sid (at least recently), Debian is significantly different (systemd based, etc).\r\n\r\nAfter it didn't come up on GCE, I tried to use it interactively with docker2boot --justraw, which spits out the qemu command line to run to interact with it.  The root username is \"root\" and the password is \"r\".\r\n\r\nNetworking was busted, the root filesystem was read-only, etc.\r\n\r\nCould anybody spend a bit of time working on this? We only have two left before Docker is gone and we can simplify the coordinator. (he other Dockerfile remaining is nacl, which is a unique butterfly, but should be pretty straightforward I think and I'll try it next.)\r\n\r\n/cc @saljam (who seems to like these things :)), @adg, @minux \r\n",
