The fact that it still fails in all those versions is no surprise now given the \"Unplanned, Go1.6\" milestone target.\r\n\r\nFWIW, in my case, I was using \"crypto/x509,\" and I was trying to set my constant to x509.RSA (one of the three defined PublicKeyAlgorithms).  Obviously, it was a silly mistake to leave off the \".RSA\", but with that esoteric compiler error, it took me a few minutes to track down the problem, especially since I had made several other changes in my source files since my last successful compile.\r\n\r\nYes, once understood, the user error is easily correctable, but given this is apparently a regression from 1.4, please consider fixing for a 1.6 minor release or 1.7.",
