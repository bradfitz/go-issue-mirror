	"body": "Both android and iOS provide OS software onscreen keyboards. The event package needs a common API for activating both, and needs to adjust the reported screen space appropriately.\r\n\r\nThere are some curious complications for those of us used to traditional keyboards, but nothing impossible:\r\n- there are various ways to suggest different key layouts (for example, just a numeric pad)\r\n- word suggestion can translate in a large number of single key presses all at once",
