It's talking about the Comment and Name fields in gzip.Header.\r\n2. Those fields are Go `string`s.\r\n3. Canonically, Go `string`s are UTF-8, so they can represent any sequence of Unicode characters (including embedded NULs).\r\n4. However, the underlying gzip file format only allows Comment and Name to contain the Unicode characters U+0001 through U+00FF (because it's actually Latin-1 with a NUL terminator).\r\n5. If the Comment or Name fields contain other characters, then `gzip.(*Writer).Write` will return an error.",
