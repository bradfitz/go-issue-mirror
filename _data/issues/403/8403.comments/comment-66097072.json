The\ndocumentation doesn't say what will happen in this case, and one solution feels as good\nas the other to me.  Code based on the old behavior will likely often be wrong.  It\nwould be nice if the documentation and/or release notes reflected the change.\n\nJust for the sake of clarity: the code I'm working with assumed that an error meant the\nwhole request was bad (protocol/network error, etc) and bail out completely.  If there\nwas no error, it would check properties on the request to figure out what had actually\nhappened.\u003c/pre\u003e",
