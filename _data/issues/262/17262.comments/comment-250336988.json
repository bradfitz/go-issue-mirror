What do you propose to do on Windows?\r\n\r\n\u003e I'd love that default to be GOPATH=$HOME because that means $GOPATH/bin will be in their path\r\n\r\nI am always worried about having $GOPATH/bin in my PATH. `go get` installs other people's programs there. Do we really want new Go user installing random programs from the Internet somewhere in their PATH?\r\n\r\nAlex",
