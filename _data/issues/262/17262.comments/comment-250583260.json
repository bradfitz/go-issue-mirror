	"body": "$HOME/go is not a good option for GOPATH. let's make a simple exercise of behaviour... new users can easy consider the default like a best practice. let say i'm a new user, why should i consider the defaults a bad thing? more than that the easiest (and the best?) method to install golang is by unpack in $HOME because with this method the compiler is always at the last version and need not root rights so you can easy suppose that many users will have go compiler in $HOME/go. why should i move the compiler in /usr/local when i can simply didn't?\r\nmore than that they can make projects and can clone projects in this folder. so, they will have a messy folder and with a little careless they can easy delete their project folder with a new golang reinstallation.\r\nalso, windows users have c:\\go by default.
