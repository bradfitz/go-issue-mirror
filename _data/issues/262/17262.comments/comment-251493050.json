My main point was really to point out another reason that $HOME/go is probably not problematic as a GOPATH default, as it's probably not the most \"idiomatic Linux\" path for local user installs of Go (a.k.a. GOROOT) anyway.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I belive it has been [discussed before](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-TyrI5FQ0kfE8p9R4QN0cZlrKWCSrLsejMjVSZ4cX2Y/edit) to use XDG_CACHE_HOME for a default GOPATH, which was why I mentioned XDG_DATA_HOME -- although I don't know which role the authors of the linked document serve, or how \"official\" it is.",
