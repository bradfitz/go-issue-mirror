Perhaps other Windows users will comment here.\r\n\r\n\u003e If no such path exists, assume C:/gocode.\r\n\r\nYou want C:\\gocode instead.\r\nPutting things in the root of C:\\ does not sounds right to me. Would you recommend GOPATH to be set to /gocode on Linux?\r\nBut, given that Windows installer already installs Go into C:\\go, C:\\gocode for GOPATH is at least consistent.\r\n\r\nAlex",
