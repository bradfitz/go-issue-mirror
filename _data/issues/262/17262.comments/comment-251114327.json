It is not productive, and I feel this discussion has already strayed pretty far from Dave Cheney's originally post.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure the actual absolute location matters that much, I think all this thread really needs to decide is \"do we want a default Gopath?\" (sounds like that's a more-or-less overwhelming yes) and \"should it be shared systemwide, or local to the user\" (so far most discussion has been about local). After that, whomever implements can pick `$HOME/gocode` or `$HOME/go` or `/usr/share/go/` or whatever they desire that seems reasonable to whomever reviews the PR, and things will probably continue to be pretty okay.",
