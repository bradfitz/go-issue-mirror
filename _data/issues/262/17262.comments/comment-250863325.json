(Obviously\nthis only makes sense for go get import.path/for/a/command, if it's not a\ncommand, go get should fail without $GOPATH being set)\n\nFor the outsider, this makes much sense, just like wget a file.\n\nOnce the user wants to start writing Go code, they should learn how to set\nGOPATH properly.\n",
