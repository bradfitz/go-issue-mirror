Thank you for the detailed explanation.\n\nI recall another issue about Go memory management - something about Go requiring a large\ncontiguous chunk of RAM when a program launches, which on 32-bit systems can fail in\ncertain circumstances. I can't seem to find updated info on this issue - is it still a\nproblem with Go 1.1? Can you characterize this issue? \n\nI'd like to determine if Go can be stable WRT memory running as a 32-bit Windows desktop\napp (understanding that Go is intended as a 64-bit server language). Are there still any\nmemory-management concerns with this?\u003c/pre\u003e",
