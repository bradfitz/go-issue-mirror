Allocating a vector with around\n1.000.000 floats is not that uncommon if you process scientific data. One vector in this\nexample should be about 8Mb, the program crashed at 530Mb, thats only 70 vectors. I am\nmost certain \"much\" is a bit more than 70 vectors in some very common cases.\nI really don't want to complain, I like go and the compilers, they are great on 64bit,\nbut this is a serious bug. I'm a bit surprised that you think that it isn't.\n\nI'm still not convinced that it is the same bug though, since my problem is not only the\nGC, but that the memory allocation fails when \u003e1Gb free memory is available.\u003c/pre\u003e",
