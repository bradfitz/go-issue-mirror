That test will tell you if you have\nthis issue within a couple of seconds to minutes. You need this test despite this issue.\nYou might write memory leaking code all on your own in another language, despite the\nminor shortcomings of the Go runtime.\n\nYou should also having something (systemd, upstart, whatever) supervising your Go\nprocess. Depending on what you choose, you could limit the maximum memory usage (or if\nyou're running on 32-bit, it won't go over 2 GB anyway). Again, you should have this for\nany service written in any language anyway so that rare crashes don't bring down your\nhigh-reliability production system.\n\nAlso, you can further guard against this issue by running 64-bit code instead of 32-bit\ncode.\u003c/pre\u003e",
