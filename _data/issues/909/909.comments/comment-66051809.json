I.e. are\nthere any language design choices which make a practical realisation impossible? I\nreally like the Go language, and I understand the reasons for the current choice of GC,\nbut realistically, due to design choices and restrictions (Cgo etc..), are we going to\nbe stuck with this situation for the foreseeable future?\n\nI really hope not, but currently this issue is barring me from promoting the use of Go\nin my workplace...\n\nRegards,\u003c/pre\u003e",
