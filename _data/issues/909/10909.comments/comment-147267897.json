The way I imagined it would be:\r\n\r\n```Go\r\n// Deprecated: Use SlicePtrFromStrings instead.\r\n//\r\n// StringSlicePtr converts a slice of strings to a slice of pointers\r\n// to NUL-terminated byte arrays. If any string contains a NUL byte\r\n// this function panics instead of returning an error.\r\nfunc StringSlicePtr(ss []string) []*byte {\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003e I don't really like the idea of putting the word \"Deprecated\" first.\r\n\r\nDo you still dislike it even given the above? If so, that's completely okay. I just wanted to mention minor idea so that it would be considered.\r\n\r\n\u003e But perhaps godoc should be made to hide or collapse the definitions of\r\ndeprecated functions, and to highlight the word \"Deprecated\" in bold and/or\r\nred.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it (and many other Go editors/tools) can/should do that. But I think that's an orthogonal optional enhancement.\r\n\r\nI realize requiring \"Deprecated:\" to come first will require an update to `golint` which currently checks that comments begin with \"// {{.IdenitiferName}} ...\".",
