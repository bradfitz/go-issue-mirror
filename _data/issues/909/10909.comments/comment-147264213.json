	"body": "I have a question. Would it be better or worse if \"Deprecated:\" was made mandatory to be the first word of a doc comment for a deprecated field/variable/func/method? That seems like the first thing the documentation should convey, and having it be something other than the first word means a user is possibly going to spend some time reading/learning about a new method before realizing that it's already deprecated.\r\n\r\nConsider the 3rd example above:\r\n\r\n```Go\r\n// Do fires the missiles.\r\n//\r\n// Deprecated: missiles supplies depleted. Do is a no-op now.\r\nfunc Do() error\r\n```\r\n\r\nA user would need to read all of \"Do fires the missiles.\" or however long that comment is, while spending energy understanding the functionality, only then to hopefully get to the next paragraph that says it's deprecated and they should be reading about something else instead.\r\n\r\nI had this thought on my mind and just wanted to share it.",
