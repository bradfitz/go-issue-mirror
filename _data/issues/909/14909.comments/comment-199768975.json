	"body": "The issue here is that StdSizes doesn't compute the final padding in a struct. The `pp` type has 5 bytes of padding at the end, to make the struct as a whole align on 8 bytes.\r\n\r\nWhile looking into this, I noticed another issue: Since Go 1.5, zero-sized fields at the end of the struct effectively have size 1 (see #9401). However, that's specific to the gc compiler, and other compilers might have a different layout. What should go/types do here?",
