	"body": "Elaborating a bit more: There are reasons (as pointed out by issue #9401) why an implementation might want to add some padding. There are reasons why an implementation might want to always add regular padding at the end of a struct. But those are implementation decisions.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the language spec (I believe) that requires a certain padding or even demands that the field order in memory matches the field order declared in a struct declaration.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, too much code is depending on such an order and even the padding (or so people believe) that it's become \"impossible\" to change this w/o breaking code in very subtle ways (though I don't have specific evidence for this claim, either). That said, we have refrained in the past from demanding (via the spec) that the order be fixed. See issue #10014 for a discussion.\r\n\r\nRegarding this issue specifically: go/types does not have to agree 100% with the compilers in this respect. It's a model implementation, and in this case we chose to model a more efficient layout.\r\n\r\nIf need be, it has hooks to change the size computations as needed. Clients can customize it.",
