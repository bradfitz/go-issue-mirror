When using Semaphore CI they symlink your project directory under the GOPATH to somewhere outside the GOPATH, so when I ran tests everything went fine except the paths in the coverprofile were for the symlinked directory and not the proper GOPATH,  because of that when submitting to coveralls.io the repo and coverprofile paths did not match up resulting in 0% test coverage being reported.\r\n\r\nYours may work fine, but might want to check that out; that's why in my package I ask for the package for relative to the GOPATH/SRC/ directory so I can navigate there abstracting that issue away from the end user.",
