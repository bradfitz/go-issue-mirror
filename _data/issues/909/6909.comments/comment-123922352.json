However, it was created only by running tests in the current directory, not the dependent ones. That is, it contains coverage information for all the packages that were used in running the tests for _this_ package.\r\n\r\nSo, it's not clear but I believe the request that one should be able to do\r\n\r\ngo test --coverprofile foo --coverpkg ./... ./...\r\n\r\n(note the extra ./...). The issue title is therefore incorrect, and I will address that.\r\n\r\nAs for fixing the issue, it seems to me that an external tool that merges a set of profiles is easy to do. I don't see much need for doing. this within go test itself.\r\n",
