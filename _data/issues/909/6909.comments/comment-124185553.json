It uses `golang/x/tools/cover` to parse the files and outputs a merged version back to stdout:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/wadey/gocovmerge\r\n\r\nIt's still a work in progress, but it is working great for our repos.\r\n\r\nWe combine with a generic Makefile that runs `go test -coverprofile … -coverpkg (all same repo dependencies) …` for each folder in a repo. If anyone is interested in that Makefile I can clean it up and post it as well.  ",
