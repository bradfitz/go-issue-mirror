	"body": "This was fixed for ppc64/ppc64le in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15135. The struct is missing a padding field between the ```Events``` and ```Fd``` fields.\r\n\r\nI think the ```syscall.EpollEvent``` struct is wrong for all 64-bit architectures except amd64 (which uses the packed attribute and therefore has no alignment padding) and ppc64/ppc64le (which was fixed).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/docker/containerd currently uses the ```syscall.EpollEvent``` struct directly for some operations. Presumably they should be using ```golang.org/x/sys/unix``` (which uses the correct padding on arm64 and s390x) instead however I'd like to fix this anyway since it is a very small change.\r\n\r\nCL to follow.",
