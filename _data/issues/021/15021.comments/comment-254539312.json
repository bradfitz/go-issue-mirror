What's your plan to accommodate user-specified socket descriptors with net package API access?\r\n\r\nMy guess is that your plan is just to provide a package like libuv for Node.js or mio for Rust. The package neither provide new IO methods such as {recv,send}mmsg nor replacements for broken APIs in frozen syscall and x/sys packages such as Sendfile for Darwin. Also the package doesn't help to inject user-specified socket descriptors with the net package via File{Conn,Listener,PacketConn} APIs because it doesn't address #10565. Is my understanding correct?",
