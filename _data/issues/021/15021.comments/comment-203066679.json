	"body": "Your Example looks exactly as I think it should except for the fact that\nthe call is net.RegisterSocket instead of syscall.RegisterSocket. Can\nRegisterSocket be moved into syscall? If not, why not? Thanks.\n\n\nOn Tue, Mar 29, 2016 at 3:08 PM Matt Layher \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e Hi Russ,\n\u003e\n\u003e It appears to me that the runtime network poller functionality is exposed\n\u003e directly using the net.pollDesc type, which is then wrapped by net.netFD\n\u003e and net.conn. From what I can tell, it appears I'd have to duplicate or\n\u003e possibly move some code from package net to package syscall in order to\n\u003e enable accessing the runtime network poller there.\n\u003e\n\u003e Specifically, I'm looking at net/fd_unix.go, and net/fd_poll_runtime.go.\n\u003e Is there an easier answer to this problem that I am not yet aware of?\n\u003e\n\u003e Thanks for the quick reply, and I look forward to hearing back.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/15021#issuecomment-203054121\u003e\n\u003e\n",
