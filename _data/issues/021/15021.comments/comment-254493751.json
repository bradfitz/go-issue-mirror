I'd ideally like to see it done without any syscall.Sockaddr crud.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of epoll \u0026 friends is a simple API letting people register FDs they care about (and how: readability vs writability) and wait on a bunch of them at once.\r\n\r\nWe could have an API with uintptrs to watch/unwatch, a Go type for readable/writeable, and func callbacks when the edge triggers.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody want to explore prototyping that?\r\n",
