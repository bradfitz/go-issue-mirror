	"body": "The first link in the Overview section of  http://golang.org/pkg/regexp/ , points to http://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax , which doesn't take you the equivalent replacement in github.\r\n\r\nIt should at least be corrected to https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax or to the following http://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/ . In the IRC chat I was told the later is a better/accurate description of the syntax. There is a godoc command listed below which probably gives the same output. However, it is good to have a syntax accessible from the online docs.\r\n\r\nThanks",
