	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)? go 1.6\r\n\r\nThis is a re-open of #10952. The issue was that a change to the form of a repo's URL would lead to an erroneous error during \"go get -u\". In that case, the error alluded to a custom import path even though there wasn't one.\r\n\r\nThe fix was to only perform the check if the package had an import comment. This conflates having a custom import path with having an import comment. If (a) there is a custom import path, (b) there is no import comment, and (c) the repo pointed to by the import path changes, then \"go get -u\" will incorrectly pull from the old repo.\r\n\r\nThe right fix is to resolve the import path to a repo URL, and compare that to the origin of the local repo.\r\n",
