According to\n\u003ca href=\"http://lldb.llvm.org/python-reference.html\"\u003ehttp://lldb.llvm.org/python-reference.html\u003c/a\u003e, \"LLDB has all of its core code build into a\nshared library which gets used by the lldb command line application. [...] LLDB also\nprovides an lldb.py module that contains the bindings from LLDB into Python.\" We could\nwrite Go bindings for that shared library, which would let us drive LLDB from Go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
