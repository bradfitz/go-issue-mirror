Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Compile the following program:\npackage main\nconst a [2]int = -1\nfunc main() { println(a) }\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThe program compiles and prints \u0026quot;-1\u0026quot; when executed rather than failing to\ncompile with an error such as:\nbadconst.go:2: cannot use -1 (type int) as type [2]int in constant declaration\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=386\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n7929874a70ae tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nIt appears that the assignment compatibility check for constant\ndeclarations is different than the check for assignments.\u003c/pre\u003e",
