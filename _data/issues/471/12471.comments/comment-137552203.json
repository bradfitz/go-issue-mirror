	"body": "I think the docs about default Source is pretty clear if you read it in\nfull.\n\n```\nTop-level functions, such as Float64 and Int, use a default shared Source\nthat produces a deterministic sequence of values each time a program is\nrun. Use the Seed function to initialize the default Source if different\nbehavior\nis required for each run. The default Source is safe for concurrent use by\nmultiple goroutines.\n```\n\nIt explicitly mentions the default Source is the one used by the top-level\nfunctions.\n\nFollowing Go documentation convention, anything not explicitly\ndocumented for concurrency safety is not safe for concurrent use.\nThe NewSource doesn't say Source is safe for concurrent use, so\nit's not.\n",
