	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eSee \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/misc/pprof#709\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/misc/pprof#709\u003c/a\u003e\n\nOn line 729 of pprof, RunWeb has a static list of places to search for default-browser\nsymlinks, or tries to fall back to \u0026quot;google-chrome\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;firefox\u0026quot; if\nthat fails.  Falling back to those is currently failing because the \u0026quot;-f\u0026quot; Perl\nbuiltin does not search $ENV{PATH}, so \u0026quot;google-chrome\u0026quot; never exists and never\nlaunches (unless it happens to be in the current directory), resulting in \u0026quot;Could\nnot load web browser.\u0026quot;.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. use an operating system that doesn't include /etc/alternatives/gnome-www-browser or\n/etc/alternatives/x-www-browser\n2. run go tool pprof --web on a profiler file\n\nWhat is the expected output?\ngoogle-chrome or firefox launches (preferably the default browser, but that is quite a\ndifficult proposition on linux, so the current intention of the code would be sufficient)\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\u0026quot;Could not load web browser.\u0026quot;\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nSpecifically Gentoo with GNOME2, but any OS that doesn't provide those /etc/alternative\nentries by default (or removing them manually) would be sufficient.\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nChecked the source code in tip, and it's the same as what I've got locally in go1.0.3.\n\nThe fix I would propose is modifying that to check those first two symlinks, and if that\nfails, then check for \u0026quot;google-chrome\u0026quot; and then \u0026quot;firefox\u0026quot; within the\ndirectories in an expanded $ENV{PATH}.\u003c/pre\u003e",
