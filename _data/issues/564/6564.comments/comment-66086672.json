IHS for short.\n\nBut the HTTP/0.9 response on \u003ca href=\"http://www.whitecap.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.whitecap.com/\u003c/a\u003e does not seem to be from the same\nserver that responds to other requests.  Even if you send HTTP/1.1 without a Host:\nheader, it returns the same HTTP/0.9 redirect.\n\nIOW I think it's some other non-Apache based proxy server doing that HTTP/0.9 redirect,\nand a backend IHS doing normal responses after the redirect (with Server: header\npreserved by the weird proxy)\u003c/pre\u003e",
