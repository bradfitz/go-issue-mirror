	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eNeither Go's json template package not the json-template specification provides a\nmechanism to \naccess the key and value for iteration through a map. Ideally, I'd like to be able to\nwrite \nsomething along the lines of (but not necessarily exactly like this):\n\n{.repeated section MyMap}\n   {.key}: {.value}\n{.end}\n\nwhere MyMap is a map, and {.key} and value {.value} provide access to the current key\nand value.\n\nIt may not be necessary to provide the {.value} directive; in analogy with other\nrepeated sections, \nthis should probably just be @. Thus {.key} plays the role of an index for non-map\niterations. \nAlternatively, @ could stand for an entire map entry, and field names 'key' and 'value'\ncould be \nused to get to these values. For instance: {@.key} instead of {.key}; analogous for the\nvalues.\u003c/pre\u003e",
