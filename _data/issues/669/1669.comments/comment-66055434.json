And\nI had to add it for tip patch because it compile test apps in misc/ and adding chpax to\neach of them is just crazy.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1669/4/go-release-chpax.patch\"\u003ego-release-chpax.patch\u003c/a\u003e (623 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1669/4/go-tip-chpax.patch\"\u003ego-tip-chpax.patch\u003c/a\u003e (828 bytes)",
