Add a new convenience function will not solve the\nproblem: if the user knows to use it, he/she can also write the two lines\nout, but if they don't know about the problem, it's very probable that they\ndon't know about the proposed convenience function either.\n\nNot to mention that code that uses the new function will not compile under\nolder Go releases, and I doubt people will trade compatibility with older\nGo releases for such a trivial convenience function.\n",
