	"body": "The current code is careful to never erroneously check a non-pointer value as though it were a pointer, as that can cause false positives and, worse, unpredictable behavior when using PIE with ASLR.  We might be able to use your suggestion if we recorded where a pointer might be in the C type, and also looked at the Go code to see whether the field was in fact initialized with an actual pointer.  That could in principle catch errors like your original report, though of course it would hardly be foolproof.",
