I will contact you offline.\r\nWhat's weird is that my desktop _is_ z620, however with slightly different CPU E5-2690 @ 2.90GHz. I also turned off frequency scaling, so it always runs at 2.9 as opposed to your 1.2. But I would say that lowever frequency should make it less reproducible...\r\n\r\n",
