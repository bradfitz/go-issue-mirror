They would be similar to After() and NewTimer(), except\nthat instead of specifying a duration, they specify a instant in time and at some point\nafter that time, the current time is sent to the channel.\n\nSuch functions would:\n- be useful to schedule code execution or implement crontab-like functionality\n- be closer to what is actually implemented by the runtime\n\nIt is not clear whether it can be emulated with the current After() and NewTimer(),\nsince they internally syscall nanotime() which may return after an indeterminate\nduration.\n\nRÃ©my.\u003c/pre\u003e",
