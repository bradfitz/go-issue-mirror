I'm assuming that if we don't use\nmadvise to return memory to the OS, mincore could be wrong and it wouldn't\nmatter -- just a wild guess.\n\nWhat is the page size on mips64?\n\nOn Thu, 11 Feb 2016, 16:21 Ian Lance Taylor \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e On GNU/Linux, on 386, amd64, arm, and arm64, system calls return a\n\u003e negative errno value, in eax, rax, r0, r0, respectively. On mips64 and\n\u003e ppc64, they return a positive errno value, in r2 and r3, respectively.\n\u003e\n\u003e In the runtime package, I think that the implementation of mmap on arm64\n\u003e is wrong and the implementation of mincore on mips64 and ppc64 is wrong.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/14297#issuecomment-182717231\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
