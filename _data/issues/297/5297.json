	"body": "by **dragos.constantin.stoica**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eHello,\n\nFirst thank you for the great work that you are doing with go. We started to use go last\nyear for a medium sized project. Go is used as middleware for a 3 tier application and\nacts as a web server. From this point of view it does a great job. We have a load of\nabout 300 users per week and about 20-30 concurrent users connected on the server\nanytime of day from 08:00-17:00. The application is a document management - flow\nmanagement and the documents are stored in JSON format in CouchDB.\n\nThe problem:\nWhen the load of 30 concurrent users per day is superseded the server enters in a state\nwhere no more connections are accepted from users and no responses are sent to already\nconnected users. The go program does not crash.\nThe issues is linked with too many connections being in TIME_WAIT state, despite the\nfact that the open file limit is not even reached.\nIf we kill the go program and restart it the problem is solved - TIME_WAIT connections\nare freed and everything goes back to normal operation.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nUbuntu Server 11.04 64bits\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n1.0.3\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\ncat /proc/sys/fs/file-max \n70000\n\nmore /etc/sysctl.conf \n#\n# /etc/sysctl.conf - Configuration file for setting system variables\n# See /etc/sysctl.d/ for additional system variables\n# See sysctl.conf (5) for information.\n#\n\nfs.file-max = 70000\n...\n\nmore /etc/security/limits.conf \n# /etc/security/limits.conf\n[user_for_go_program]       soft    nofile  10000\n[user_for_go_program]       hard    nofile  30000\n# End of file\u003c/pre\u003e",
