I did this work for Java (in particular, fork/join CRC calculation) and it was judged to be too scary for incorporation into the Java standard library because it used threads.  For CRCs that use different polynomials than the one wired into the CRC32 instruction, you can (on sufficiently modern AMD64) use carryless multiply to get a nice serial speed boost, too.",
