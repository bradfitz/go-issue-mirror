	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nthis is gofmt output at tip for a struct with some other inline structs.\n\nthe order of the fields changes the formatted output quite a lot:\n\ntype A1 struct {\n\tAbcdefg struct {\n\t\tI int\n\t}\n\tAbcdefgh   Zaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n\tBbbbbbbbbb error\n\tPPPPPPpp   struct {\n\t\tJ   int\n\t\tErr error\n\t}\n\tLllllllllll error\n}\n\ntype A2 struct {\n\tAbcdefgh Zaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n\tAbcdefg  struct {\n\t\tI int\n\t}\n\tBbbbbbbbbb error\n\tPPPPPPpp   struct {\n\t\tJ   int\n\t\tErr error\n\t}\n\tLllllllllll error\n}\n\ntype A3 struct {\n\tAbcdefgh   Zaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n\tBbbbbbbbbb error\n\tAbcdefg    struct {\n\t\tI int\n\t}\n\tPPPPPPpp struct {\n\t\tJ   int\n\t\tErr error\n\t}\n\tLllllllllll error\n}\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nI'm not really sure what's best.\n\nI'd suggest that the struct keyword of inline structs should never get a bunch of spaces\nbefore it. Alternatively, it should at least always line up with the other types.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nlinux\n\nWhich revision are you using?
