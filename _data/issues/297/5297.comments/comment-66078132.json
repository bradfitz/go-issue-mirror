So we are currently investigating an alternative implementation of connection\nsharing and reusing mechanism.\n\nWe also suspect that for short load bursts the system does not reclaim the sockets that\nare in TIME_WAIT so this may lead the middleware to \"hang\".\n\nThank you for your answer.\nI will leave this issue open since there is no diagnostic yet and no solution.\u003c/pre\u003e",
