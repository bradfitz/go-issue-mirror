That suggests that the g value which is active has\ng-\u003egoid == 0 and is not the one in the actual goroutine list. That is, the g value is\ncompletely bogus. You really need to make this happen under a debugger to have any\nchance. Everything is set up wrong. Printing is not going to work.\n\nI expect this will be a NetBSD-specific bug, so it will not block the 1.3 release.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.3maybe**, removed **release-go1.3**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
