From the gethostbyname() manpage:\n \nIf name is an IPv4 or IPv6 address, no lookup is performed and \ngethostbyname() simply copies name into the  h_name  field  and  its\nstruct  in_addr equivalent into the h_addr_list[0] field of the returned\nhostent structure.\n\nWhich revision are you using?\nchangeset:   5092:c4e62b8f7f1c\u003c/pre\u003e",
