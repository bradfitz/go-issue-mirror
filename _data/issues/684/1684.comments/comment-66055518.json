The api\nwould be simplified to the following functions and remove the automatic registration of\nthe handler:\n\n// Publish the variable to name.\nfunc Publish(name string, v interface{})\n\n// Get returns the value registered under name\nfunc Get(name string) interface{}\n\n// Published returns a slice of the currently published keys\nfunc Published() []string\n\n// Register the default vars object with the default http server. Place this in your \n// package or commands's init function to register the handler automatically. This \n// function is guarded by a sync.Once object.\nfunc Register()\n\nPublished does present a possible race condition, so that may need to be changed. The\nstructure that implements the above functions, called Exporter, would be exposed in case\none wants to mount the handler at a different location or has some specific use case.\nThis structure would implement http.Handler and json.Marshaler.\u003c/pre\u003e",
