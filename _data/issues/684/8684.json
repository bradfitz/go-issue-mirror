If the linker is run on a FUSE filesystem, this will result in the\nfollowing sequence of events at exit:\n\n1. removeall unlinks /var/tmp/go-link-foo/go.o\n2. FUSE sees that there is still an open file handle and renames go.o to\n.fuse_hidden00000\n3. removeall calls rmdir against /var/tmp/go-link-foo which returns ENOTEMPTY due to the\n.fuse_hidden file\n\nThe result is that the /var/tmp/go-link-foo directory ends up not being removed. My\nunderstanding is that this might happen on NFS mounts as well.\n\nThe solution is simply to close the outfile before calling removeall. I'll send a CL in\na minute.\u003c/pre\u003e",
