	"body": "That seems reasonable. I believe the `requestFirstKeyChange()` would also need to lock the mutex around sending KexInit packets before checking the sessionID as well in order to prevent the race.\r\n\r\nWhile highly unlikely, the problem around receiving a KexInit while reading other packets is still a possibility. Due to the manner in which key exchanges are handled internally, I still think it would make sense to explore ideas around ignoring these packets in all cases in which we are not performing a key exchange.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to look at this.",
