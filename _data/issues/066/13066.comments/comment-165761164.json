I'm already in direct contact with ARM and with some of the new server/cpu manufacturers for ARM64 and hoping to find some possible solution - can't promise anything right now, but I'll try my best.\r\n\r\nMy goal would be, to get official ARM64 binary builds too.\r\n\r\nHow much build servers or instances would we need? Preferable as a cloud service or is it possible to use on-premise too, with a high-speed internet access of course?",
