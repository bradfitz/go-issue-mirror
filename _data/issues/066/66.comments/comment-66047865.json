See the following thread for\ninformation \n\u003ca href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1216267/ab-program-freezes-after-lots-of-requests-why\"\u003ehttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/1216267/ab-program-freezes-after-lots-of-requests-why\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThis is from the above thread:\n\nOn Mac OS X the default ephemeral port range is 49152 to 65535, for a total of 16384\nports. You can check this with the sysctl command:\n\n$ sysctl net.inet.ip.portrange.first net.inet.ip.portrange.last\nnet.inet.ip.portrange.first: 49152\nnet.inet.ip.portrange.last: 65535\n\nChanging this configuration to start from 32768 helped\n$ sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.portrange.first=32768\nnet.inet.ip.portrange.first: 49152 -\u003e 32768\n\nAnother configuration that I changed was for default timeout\nSet the default timeout to 1000ms like so:\n\n$ sudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.msl=1000\nnet.inet.tcp.msl: 15000 -\u003e 1000\n\nAfter changing above configuration following are the results \n\nServer Software:        \nServer Hostname:        localhost\nServer Port:            4000\n\nDocument Path:          /\nDocument Length:        12 bytes\n\nConcurrency Level:      1\nTime taken for tests:   17.005 seconds\nComplete requests:      100000\nFailed requests:        0\nWrite errors:           0\nTotal transferred:      14800000 bytes\nHTML transferred:       1200000 bytes\nRequests per second:    5880.58 [#/sec] (mean)\nTime per request:       0.170 [ms] (mean)\nTime per request:       0.170 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)\nTransfer rate:          849.93 [Kbytes/sec] received\n\nConnection Times (ms)\n              min  mean[+/-sd] median   max\nConnect:        0    0   0.1      0      12\nProcessing:     0    0   0.0      0       1\nWaiting:        0    0   0.0      0       1\nTotal:          0    0   0.1      0      12\n\nPercentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)\n  50%      0\n  66%      0\n  75%      0\n  80%      0\n  90%      0\n  95%      0\n  98%      0\n  99%      0\n 100%     12 (longest request)\u003c/pre\u003e",
