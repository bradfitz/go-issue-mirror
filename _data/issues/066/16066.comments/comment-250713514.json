	"body": "@magiconair as @bradfitz said I think it would be good to make clear that only certain items on the Config returned by GetConfig will be respected. Then the recursion and ordering issues can be avoided.\r\n\r\nMaybe having ALPN info on the ClientHello isn't absolutely necessary for what I'm trying to do. I could offer h2 or not and the client can accept it or not if it wants. Hopefully I'm thinking that through correctly.\r\n\r\nAlso, @bradfitz, my last comment went out too quickly and ended up sounding short. That wasn't what I intended, sorry about that. Thanks for helping move this along!",
