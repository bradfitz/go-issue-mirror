And this is the real 'problem':\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat numgoroutine.go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport \"runtime\"\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tprintln(runtime.NumGoroutine())\r\n}\r\n$ go run numgoroutine.go \r\n1\r\n$ go run -linkshared numgoroutine.go \r\n2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis difference is present in 1.6 so not a regression. I'll either try to figure out what's going on or just fix the test in early 1.8.",
