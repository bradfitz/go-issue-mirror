	"body": "The SSA Call block is a vestige of when we had explicit panic edges in the call graph.  Now that panic edges are implicit, we don't really need a call block - call Values take a memory and produce a memory, and that is enough to get all the memory ordering correct (even if the call panics).\r\n",
