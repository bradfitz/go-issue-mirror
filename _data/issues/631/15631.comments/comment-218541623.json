	"body": "I think value number compaction will help a lot with our trouble case. Normal ID utilization at entry to regalloc is normally 30â€“60%; for the trouble case, it is 0.6%, and that translates into giant allocs. I started on a number compaction optimization a couple of days ago but ran into some bumps (free lists, constant caches) and decided to see whether I could avoid generating so many values to begin with. I found a few minor optimizations (worth a couple of percent of total allocs) but nothing worth mailing during the freeze. I have one idea left to try before moving on, will know about that soon. If no one has started on it, I'm happy to finish off ID compaction. Please let me know one way or the other.",
