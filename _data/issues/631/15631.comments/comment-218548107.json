We should be able to cheaply decide to only compact if f.NumValues \u003e some threshold and % utilization \u003c some threshold, but it might always be worth doing, at least until other improvements obviate it. And yes, we will definitely want some way to disable it entirely via a flag for debugging. \r\n\r\nGiven the subtlety of sparse phi and other mucking around, it's possible we should just do ID compaction for 1.8; not sure it that gets us far enough.",
