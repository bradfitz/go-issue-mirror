Add the finalizer back in package os,\nand then in the *File Close method, add\n\nruntime.SetFinalizer(file, nil)\n\nand see if the memory usage stabilizes.\n\nIf (a) finalizers are the problem and (b) files are being\nclosed properly, then this should disable the finalizer\non an explicit close, which should resolve the problem.\n\nI tried this and it didn't work for me, but it is possible\nthat I did not run the test correctly.  Please let me know\nif it works for you.\u003c/pre\u003e",
