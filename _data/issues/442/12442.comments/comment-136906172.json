	"body": "cgo works by building a C file, compiling it, and examining the debug info.  In this case it is complaining because it expects pointer types to have the size of a pointer.  For GOARCH=386 a pointer is obviously 4 bytes, but the debug info is indicating that the pointer is 8 bytes.\r\n\r\nIn order to use cgo in a cross-compilation situaiton like this one, you need to set CC tin the environment o a cross-compiler for ARM.  Look for \"when cross-compiling\" in https://golang.org/cmd/cgo .\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this on the assumption that you didn't set CC.  Please reopen if I've misunderstood.",
