I don't understand how the header files could be the problem, but\nif they are in fact the problem, it should be possible to put together a standalone test\ncase that provides the header files being used.\n\nNote that the error here is coming from gcc, not cgo.  It might help to show us the \"go\nbuild -x\" output.\u003c/pre\u003e",
