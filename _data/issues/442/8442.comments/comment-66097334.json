Could either of you try to provide a more minimized test case for this issue? \n\nIs \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/T8qEZaV_Vu\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/T8qEZaV_Vu\u003c/a\u003e not small enough? Please, explain.\n\n\u003e ... Preferably a self-contained .go file that doesn't depend on any system headers.\n\nAs I understand this issue, it is C \"include\" statement order that causes the error and\nmisunderstanding here. So we won't be able to have sample code without \"system headers\".\n\n\u003e ... the error messages cgo outputs seem adequately informative to me. ...\n\nAre you saying the quoted above message:\n\n37: error: 'EnumProcesses' undeclared (first use in this function)\n\nis informative? But, like rogerpack2005 says, EnumProcesses \"... *is* declared in one of\nthe include files\". cgo is wrong here.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
