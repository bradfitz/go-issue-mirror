If I insert `runtime.GC()` in one of the goroutines but not the one with the for loop then program hangs upon calling it for the first time.\r\n\r\nIt still look like a strange behaviour to lock entire process but at least I understand why it's happening. Hope that #10958 would be fixed as it does look like it may affect real production code.",
