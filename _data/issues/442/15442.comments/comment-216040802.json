	"body": "Well, it didn't help me. SIGQUIT didn't output anything that would tell me that it's GC that locked up the process. The stacktrace doesn't even mention any relevant Go runtime sources so that I could at least start somewhere.\r\n\r\nYes, for {} loop is legal but it leads to program that locks up without telling why. You have to understand Go runtime to know why and not even the basics of it. There're 3 solutions that I can think of right now:\r\n1. Leave everything as it is but output better diagnostic messages so that the cause of the issue is obvious. \r\n2. Insert runtime.Gosched() call.\r\n3. Don't allow infinite loops at all.",
