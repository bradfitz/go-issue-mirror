	"body": "by **rogerpack2005**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat does 'go version' print?\n\ngo version go1.3 windows/386\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\nWhile trying to debug compiler failures with \u0026quot;cgo\u0026quot; files, for instance this:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/T8qEZaV_Vu\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/T8qEZaV_Vu\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\u0026gt; go.exe run yo.go\n# command-line-arguments\n37: error: 'EnumProcesses' undeclared (first use in this function)\n\nIs the error message.  Which leaves you scratching your head, since it *is* declared in\none of the include files.\nThe real problem in this case, is that basically, the includes are in the wrong order,\nin GCC I get \u0026quot;warnings\u0026quot; like this:\n\nc:\\devkit451\\mingw\\bin\\../lib/gcc/mingw32/4.5.1/../../../../include/psapi.h:30:2: error:\nexpected specifier-qualifier-list before ‘LPVOID’\n\nTo warn me that something is amiss--go doesn't seem to give me any warnings, just a\nmisleading error message.  Using it with the \u0026quot;-work\u0026quot; parameter also doesn't\nseem to spit out any useful to look at files.\n\nIt would be really good if it noted to you that the C files it compiles with your\nsnippet don't work *at all*.\u003c/pre\u003e",
