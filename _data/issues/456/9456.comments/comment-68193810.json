Will fix and add a test to runtime.\r\n\r\nOpenBLAS has a global constructor (https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/blob/develop/driver/others/memory.c#L1291)\r\nthat creates worker threads correspond to the each of processors in the system.\r\n\r\nThe worker threads are periodically waken up to check if there is work for\r\nthem (https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/blob/develop/driver/others/blas_server.c#L268),\r\nso it's possible that during the long data preparation steps (where the Go\r\ncode has not made any cgo call yet), SIGPROF comes to one of the waken worker thread\r\nof OpenBLAS and trigger the problem.",
