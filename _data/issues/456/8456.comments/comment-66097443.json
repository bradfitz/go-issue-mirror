Even though the error\npossibly returned may mean the file didn't existed when os.Stat was executing, it does\nnot mean the file does not exists now, when os.Stat completed.\n\nUse os.O_EXCL when creating a file which must not exists already and the err from\nos.Open when a file must exist before opening.\u003c/pre\u003e",
