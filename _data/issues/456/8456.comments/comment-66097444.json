Programs can\nbe structured such that the same goroutine that may create the file is also the same one\nthat checks if the file exists. Or, one can use channels to pass \"ownership\" of the\nfilename. Files don't magically appear on computers, and in many cases the file won't be\ncreated outside the program.\u003c/pre\u003e",
