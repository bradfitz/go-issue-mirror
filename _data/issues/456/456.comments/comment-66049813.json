That's unfortunate, but I understand.\n\nUnfortunate because a negative number often has very different \"erroneous\" behavior \nthan an erroneous large number, and the number of conditional tests required doubles:\n\nfunc foo(s string, size int) {\n    if (size \u0026lt; 0 || size \u0026gt; MAX) error;\n}\n\ninstead of\n\nfunc foo(s string, size int) {\n    if (size \u0026gt; MAX) error;\n}\n\nThe fact that \"int\" is the default type for integer constants is specious IMHO: half \nthe values expressable by int are invalid/improper for sizes and indices, so it's \nreally the wrong type.  I'd much rather \"var i uint = 0\" where needed and be assured \nof valid runtime functionality.\n\nHowever, this is a minor issue, so knowing that it was deliberate I won't protest it \nfurther.\u003c/pre\u003e",
