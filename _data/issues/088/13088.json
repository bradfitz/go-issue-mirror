	"body": "At work, I use a combination of Windows + Cygwin/MSYS2 to get my job done. Both Cygwin and MSYS2 using a mintty which is a xterm-256color terminal. My preferred backup tool on this setup is [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic). Restic use x/crypto/ssh/terminal for password authentication. This works fine with a standard Dos Box, but not with my bash (Posix) setup [see restic issue #330](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/330).\r\n\r\nSo I've changed the terminal code to use the `util_linux.go` version, but syscall.Termios is not defined.",
