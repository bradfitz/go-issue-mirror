	"body": "I would love to be able to specify during go build/run additional packages to be imported. This would be mostly useful for those packages that are imported for their side effects.\r\n\r\nAs an example consider:\r\n\r\n    $ go build example.com/myapp -import github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql\r\n\r\nThis should have the same effect as adding the following import in the root package of myapp:\r\n\r\n    import _ \"github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql\"\r\n\r\nRight now I'm using a [quick-and-dirty tool](https://github.com/CAFxX/pluggo/tree/master/cmd/multibuild) for this but I really can't help thinking this should be part of the go command. \r\n\r\nThis would basically enable a very rudimental form of (compiler-mediated) DI.",
