I would argue that a Set is probably\nmore of a fundamental data structure than even a map.  While we can use a map to model\nas a set as I've done here: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/deckarep/golang-set\"\u003ehttps://github.com/deckarep/golang-set\u003c/a\u003e. I'm still not quite\nhappy with having to use interface{}.  Also, it's not exactly trivial to come up with a\nfull implementation that utilizes all the set operations.\n\nPlease consider it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
