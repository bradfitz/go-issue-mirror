Last assignment wins.\r\n\r\nIn Russ' example, suppose you had a map from strings to something.  Suppose the strings were small but potentially keeping large buffers live.  You could do:\r\n\r\n    for k, v := range m {\r\n        m[string([]byte(k))] = v\r\n    }\r\nTo allocate only the backing store required for the existing strings.  If the behavior was the other way around (first write wins) there's no way to fix the map.  You'd have to allocate a new map.",
