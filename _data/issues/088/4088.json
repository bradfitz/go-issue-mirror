	"body": "by **tfh@skip.org**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe crypto/tls client is unable to make connections when:\n\n- NPN is being used, and\n- NPN is not the last extension received in the ServerHello message.\n\nDuring umarshalling of ServerHello messages (in  crypto/tls/handshake_messages.go), too\nmany bytes are read while unmarshalling NPN extensions. It reads upto the end of the\nServerHello, instead of the end of the extension; so any extensions after NPN are\naccidentally interpreted as part of the NPN extension instead.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Run the attached test.go. It will attempt two connections to \u003ca href=\"https://skip.org:4443\"\u003ehttps://skip.org:4443\u003c/a\u003e ,\nwhich has reordered ServerHello extensions to show the problem (NPN is not the last\nextension, ServerName and others come after NPN).\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe two connections should succeed.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe connection using NPN fails.\n\nI have attached a patch which fixes the problem.\n\n\nTom\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4088/0/test.go\"\u003etest.go\u003c/a\u003e (736 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4088/0/npn-unmarsal.patch\"\u003enpn-unmarsal.patch\u003c/a\u003e (410 bytes)",
