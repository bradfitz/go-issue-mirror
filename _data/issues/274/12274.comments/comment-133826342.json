Which is the spirit of the Miller-Rabin test, and follows the good practice of clearly stating **what** the return value of the function means.\r\n\r\nYour comment says that the function is always right on prime numbers, but it could be fooled (with small probability) by composite numbers. This is correct, but why is it \"more accurate\"?\r\n\r\nYour proposed comment does not say what a `true` or `false` return value means. I see a `true` and wonder whether we are on the `// if x is prime` line or on the `// if x is not prime` line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
