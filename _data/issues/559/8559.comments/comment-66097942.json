Their types are identical, their\nfunctions are identical, initialization is identical.  The only difference between them\nis that one has its main function called by the runtime, and the program terminates when\nmain returns.\n\nIf you distinguish packages based on which of their functions are called and when, then\nyou end up distinguishing every different usage of a package by its importers.  Which is\nof course ridiculous.\u003c/pre\u003e",
