That is by design. \nThe import string determines the package.\n\nYou are saying that we should have a different rule for the main package itself.  We\n*could* have a different rule, but why *should* we?\n\nSuppose you import the main package twice, under two different names.  By the existing\nrules, you have two different packages.  Now suppose we want to make one of those\npackages be the same as the main package running the program.  Which one should we pick?\n We could pick the install name as you suggested in comment #13, but why is that the\nright thing to do?\n\nPlease don't give an argument based on the obviously right thing to do.  I don't see any\nobviously right thing to do here.  To me the most natural choice is the one we have\nalready made.\u003c/pre\u003e",
