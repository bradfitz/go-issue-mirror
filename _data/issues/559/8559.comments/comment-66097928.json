Then there would be an inconsistency between the\nPkgPath reported when it is built as a command vs when it is imported into another\npackage.\n\nPkgPath is meant to ensure the uniqueness of identifiers.  \"main\" doesn't ensure this;\nonly the true package path can.  Two different main packages might think they are\ntalking about the same field/method/type (e.g., via some serialization library) when in\nreality they are not.\n\nI guess it's not a big deal.  If not in Go1, at least Go2?\u003c/pre\u003e",
