I suggest we use that same path when building it as a\ncommand.\n\nThat would give the wrong result.  That would mean that the main package that runs and\nan imported (main) package were the same package.  That is not what we want.  An\nimported main package is just an ordinary package.  It is not the special main package\nthat is the program being run.\u003c/pre\u003e",
