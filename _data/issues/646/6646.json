Try to resolve a DNS entry.\n\nResult: No entries are read from /etc/resolv.conf, and DNS lookups fail.\n\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\nReproduces on tip as of:\n\ngo version devel +f257b02e7ffe Wed Oct 23 10:28:28 2013 -0400 darwin/amd64\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nDiscovered thanks to DNS failures in the wild; took a while to track down. The problem\nis that readLine reads no data from single-line non-\\n-terminated files.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/15960047\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/15960047\u003c/a\u003e fixes the problem. Writing tests for this part\nof the stdlib would require some refactoring.\n\n(Looks like this part of the stdlib is fairly old. E.g. it uses make(T, size)[0:0],\nwhich I presume was an idiom before make accepted a capacity. It could probably do with\nsome modernization, refactoring, and tests, but that's out of scope here. It is worth\nfiling a separate issue?)\u003c/pre\u003e",
