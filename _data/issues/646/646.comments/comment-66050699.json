It's far easier to just build the\ncompilers on the kind of machine you want them to\nrun on.\n\nWe might revisit this in a year or so but I'm not\ninclined to complicate the build process now.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
