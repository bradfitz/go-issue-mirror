But I don't expect any API\nchanges between now and getting 100% of the test cases passing. It already handles\ntrickiness like \u0026lt;svg\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;math\u0026gt;. But there might be some dark corner of\nHTML5 which isn't explored yet.\n\nI guess that that means that package html should move to exp/html.\n\nIs html/template unaffected? It currently depends on exp/html for a small utility\nfunction (html.UnescapeString), but that's copy/pastable.\u003c/pre\u003e",
