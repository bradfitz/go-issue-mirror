It's fine as is.\nThis is the grammar rule:\n\n    assign_op = [ add_op | mul_op ] \"=\" .\n\nthose are [ ] so the op is optional, allowing unadorned \"=\".\n\nAs for a,b += 1,2, the spec says:\n\n    In assignment operations, both the left- and right-hand\n    expression lists must contain exactly one single-valued expression.\n\nWe did consider allowing a,b += 1,2 a few months ago\nand decided its limited utility did not justify the additional\ncomplexity in specification.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
