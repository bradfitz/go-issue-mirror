It's generally recommended to still install them even if you don't plan\non running X, and some packages will include X dependencies for fonts, rendering\nlibraries, etc.\n\n[re #14] The reboot is intentional so that the \"first time\" bootup steps can be done at\nimage creation time rather than each VM bootup time.  After the second \"syncing disks...\ndone\", qemu *should* exit, and then you should just be waiting for the tar command on\nthe host platform to run.  (The script should probably add a message between qemu and\ntar.)\n\nIf you're sure that qemu isn't exiting even a few minutes after \"syncing disks... done\",\nthat seems like a bug and I'll try to reproduce it.\n\n[re #15] Yeah, that should be possible.  Just let me know how you want the key generated\nor where it should come from, and I'll look into updating the script accordingly.\u003c/pre\u003e",
