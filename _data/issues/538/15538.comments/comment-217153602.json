	"body": "I tested my hypothesis that forking a bunch of processes and *then* calling `dlopen` from each would work. In my limited understanding, I expected each PID to have a discrete Go runtime instantiated when they loaded a Go lib. It didn't work... file descriptor errors, semaphore errors, all sorts.\r\n\r\nI can confirm that each process had a different PID with a common parent. Each call to `dlopen` returned a unique handle value and each Go lib independently called  `init()` and reported the expected PID.\r\n\r\nIs this a red herring or is there something I can do successfully run multiple isolated Go runtimes from a shared parent PID?",
