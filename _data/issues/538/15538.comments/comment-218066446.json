Thanks.\r\n\r\nThe problem with `fork` in a multi-threaded program is that you have no idea what the other threads are doing.  They could be manipulating internal data structures when the `fork` happens, in which case there is no clean way to recover.  The closest you could come would be to reinitialize everything from scratch, but that would introduce a complex rarely exercised code path that would certainly be a source of bugs.",
