Almost all use cases would be creating applications that implement routing\nor signaling protocols for supporting routed protocol applications such as HTTP server.\n\nAPI: The same as go.net/ipv4 API, providing a few types Conn and PacketConn which wrap\nnet.Conn and implement methods talking to the protocol stack inside the kernel and\ntalking to the on-link, off-link neighbors.\u003c/pre\u003e",
