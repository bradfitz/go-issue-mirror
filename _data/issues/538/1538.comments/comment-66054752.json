It's similar to the man\npages -\u0026gt; you can make the documentation part of --help, but it's a common and usefull\nhabit to have man page available by typing man \u0026lt;command\u0026gt;.\n\nBut this really doesn't have big priority -\u0026gt; another sollution would be to add an\nsupport for generating NROFF output to godoc, so I can generate manpages from the\ndocumentation.  The ability to have a documentation available without a browser would be\nreally nice (Or maybe I'm too oldschool:)).\n\nBTW (maybe it was answered before somewhere) - what's the problem of including the\noriginal Plan9 documentation for the tool-chain?  It's quite inconvenient to launch a\nbrowser every time I need to search for an configuration option.\u003c/pre\u003e",
