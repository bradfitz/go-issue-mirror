Please review when possible, there are also tests included.\r\n\r\nWhile I recognize that it'd be easier to catch errors by only allowing 0 or 1, it'd open up the possibility of even more obscure bugs because an erroneous byte value would be discarded, leaving the reader in a potentially irrecoverable state. If no one feels strongly about this I'd like to leave it as-is.",
