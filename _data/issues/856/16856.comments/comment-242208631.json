We might be able to do that either if the compiler recognized encoding/binary.{Read,Write} (this proposal was not favorably received) or if the interface were extended to allow \"compiled\" binary.Readers and binary.Writers for a given type and endianness (where \"compilation\" would verify that the reflected type had the same layout as the data, and in that case the \"compilation\" would just be a byte-blit.\r\n\r\nIf any non-zero values gets to be \"true\" in the incoming bits and that becomes common practice, then that optimization will never happen for types that include booleans.",
