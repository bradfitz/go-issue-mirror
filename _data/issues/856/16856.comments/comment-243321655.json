Almost all of the repos that don't use `bool` with `encoding/binary` are generally only relying on the big/small endian code in the package, and don't use anything beyond the (u)int16/32/64 coding.\r\n\r\n[uses]: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/info/GoPackage/encoding/binary/-/Read",
