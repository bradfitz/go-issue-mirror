Write a .go file for cgo with a syntax error in some line \n2. Compile using the standard makefile \n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nThe error message refers to the right line number.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe error message may refer to the wrong line number.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nLinux 386\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nf776656df34c+ release.2010-06-09/release\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThis is kind of annoying since it makes it hard to find back the syntax error. In the\ndiscussion it was stated that this should be solved using a //line comment that corrects\nthe line number. It would be nice if this could be fixed. :)\u003c/pre\u003e",
