Being regex, it may introduce other issues (and\nit's unfortunate to need to resort to regex to make Go source modifications), so I'll\nlet someone else figure out if this is acceptable.\n\nI could make a CL for it, but I already have one in flight, so I'll wait until that\nmoves forward, or after 1.3 is out.\u003c/pre\u003e",
