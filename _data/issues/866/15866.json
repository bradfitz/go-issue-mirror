Anchor links for constructors link to the type instead of the func.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nAnchor link for https://tip.golang.org/pkg/net/http/#NewRequest links to https://tip.golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request\r\n\r\nAnchor links for methods are correct (for example https://tip.golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request.AddCookie)\r\n",
