I really like that Go has all these great general purpose packages,\nthat, when used, make code way less bug prone. I just wish they were as fast as the\nunsafe methods! Obviously a pipe dream, but still.\n\nI think an even faster approach to the manual swapping would be loading the entire\nstripe into the image Pix buffer at once, and then performing all the endian swaps (if\nrequired) at once/in a row. Eventually (if not already), I imagine that method would\ntake advantage of SIMD instructions, but absent that, it should still maximize cache\ncoherency and should keep the pipeline pretty saturated.\n\nHopefully I'll get around to implementing that tomorrow.\n\nI can't thank y'all enough for any amount of attention you give to this bug that likely\nonly affects a single user!\u003c/pre\u003e",
