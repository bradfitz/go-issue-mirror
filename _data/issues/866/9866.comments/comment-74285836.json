People using our releases are expected to upgrade.\r\n\r\nHowever, you are not using our releases.  You are using Debian's.  There is nothing prevent Debian from patching an old release.\r\n\r\nThat said, I have not looked at your code.  Liveness analysis is getting increasingly more precise.  Errors involving finalizers being run unexpectedly are more common in later releases.  In particular, the fact that some variable is live at the beginning of a function does not mean that it is live at the end.  This means that a finalizer may be running when you do not expect it.  Take a close look at your finalizers and make sure that when they call into C there is no way that they can be touching any C memory that is referenced by any other Go value.",
