	"body": "Sorry about the sarcasm; I am rather upset about this. Code that works with 1.2 has stopped working in 1.3, leading to a FTBFS in Ubuntu's Vivid (15.04) (which is the first one with 1.3 and not out the door yet) for code that worked up to 14.10. So we're left with deciding whether to ship unsupported golang packages, and work around the issue and hope it is a valid workaround and not merely decreasing the probability of it in testing, or moving Vivid to 1.4 (which is not a call I can make, and given that 1.4 isn't yet out of Debian *experimental* -- let alone unstable -- it is rather unlikely).",
