	"body": "by **ryan@rmarcus.info**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Create a simple test program to read in a TIFF and convert it to a PNG, like the one\nattached.\n2. Ues it to attempt to convert a 16-bit grayscale TIFF to PNG.\n3. Observe the undesirable output.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nI'd expected to see my same image, but in PNG format\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nI see an image filled with static, slightly resembling my original input.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nHmm... don't know how to check this. I'm running on 64-bit Windows, and I'm just using\nthe default, so I'm guessing 6g?\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows 7, 64-bit\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.1.1 windows/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nAn input TIFF and output TIFF are attached to this report. \n\nI've also attached a modified version of reader.go that fixes this issue (by enabling\nthe TIFF package to properly create a Gray16 image.) Hopefully, I'll generate some test\ncases and submit (a cleaned up version of) the code later this afternoon. But I might\nnot get that far.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5866/0/reader.go\"\u003ereader.go\u003c/a\u003e (12176 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5866/0/16bit.tif\"\u003e16bit.tif\u003c/a\u003e (567912 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5866/0/16bitout.png\"\u003e16bitout.png\u003c/a\u003e (194725 bytes)",
