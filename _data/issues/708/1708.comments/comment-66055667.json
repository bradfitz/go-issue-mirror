Obviously that's what 6g is doing,\nbut the rule in the spec says use the type it would have if\nthere were no \u0026lt;\u0026lt; ui.  And if you wrote\n\nvar a int = 2.0\n\nthen the type of the 2.0 would be int.  So it should have\nthe same type (int) in\n\nvar a int = 2.0 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; ui\n\nor in\n\nfunc f(int)\nf(2.0 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; ui)\n\nI believe gccgo is right in this case.  Shifts are definitely\none of the less satisfying parts of the type system.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
