	"body": "My understanding is that BMP is not compressed format. So decoding must try to allocate 16x1073741836x4 only if input size is larger than that. In this case input is few bytes, so an attempt to allocate 64GB of memory does look like a bug.\r\nFWIW, encoding/gob has such logic that detects when declared data size is larger than input.\r\nIdeally we have such logic for compressed image formats as well. But it is not directly possible. Probably we can introduce MaxMem option for decoding of compressed formats, i.e. \"decode this blob using no more than 100MB of memory\".",
