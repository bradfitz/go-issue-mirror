There's a simple test of this behavior in fmt/fmt_test.go/TestCountMallocs.\n\nHowever, Sprintf(%g\u0026quot;, float32(3.1)) takes 1 malloc on 32-bit machines, so it seems\nlike it might be a compiler issue.  Creating this issue to make sure it's looked into.\n\nIf it's fixed, the malloc count in fmt/fmt_test.go/TestCountMallocs should be changed\nfrom 2 to 1.\u003c/pre\u003e",
