	"body": "RFC 2616 is super vague about whether a GET request with a body is valid, or what to do about it.\r\n\r\nWe should decide, document, enforce, and test.\r\n\r\nI vote reject them.\r\n\r\nRFC 2616 says:\r\n\r\n\u003e   The rules for when a message-body is allowed in a message differ for\r\n \u003e  requests and responses.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e   The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the\r\n\u003e  inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in\r\n\u003e   the request's message-headers. A message-body MUST NOT be included in\r\n\u003e   a request if the specification of the request method (section 5.1.1)\r\n\u003e   does not allow sending an entity-body in requests. A server SHOULD\r\n\u003e   read and forward a message-body on any request; if the request method\r\n\u003e   does not include defined semantics for an entity-body, then the\r\n\u003e   message-body SHOULD be ignored when handling the request.\r\n\r\nBut the nothing (even in 5.1.1) about which methods have defined semantics for a body. At least GET and HEAD are not explicitly defined, so maybe that means reject them.\r\n\r\nI recall somebody (from CloudFlare?) telling me they'd seen GET+body in the wild, though?\r\n\r\nI still vote to reject them.\r\n\r\n",
