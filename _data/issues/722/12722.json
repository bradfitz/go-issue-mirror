	"body": "This adds transparency (an Alpha channel) to the existing YCbCr types for JPEG-like images and color. The N stands for non-alpha-premultiplied, the same as the existing NRGBA types.\r\n\r\nJPEG-like-with-alpha is used by the WebP format, and there already exists code (see [0]) under golang.org/x to represent such images and colors. The proposal is to move that from golang.org/x/image/webp/nycbcra to image, so that the image/draw package in the standard library can recognize such images, and implement a fast path for drawing them, the way YCbCr images are fast-pathed.\r\n\r\n[0] https://go.googlesource.com/image/+/master/webp/nycbcra/nycbcra.go\r\n",
