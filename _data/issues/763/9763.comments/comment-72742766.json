In this case it should be safe to hijack the `conn` after a `CloseNotify` because there was no `io.Copy` goroutine issuing reads to the `net.Conn` directly.\r\n\r\nThe necessary  change should be quite small and overhead negligible: https://github.com/benburkert/go/commit/3c2fd2f7df44accfaed7488f966bc041a59e6f49",
