	"body": "\u003e Are you trying to hijack after closenotify?\r\n\r\n@bmizerany I think the situation is pretty well described in the original issue. You can't hijack a connection that previously had a CloseNotifier set up on it (even if it was set up on a previous request). Essentially this means that you can't reliably use both CloseNotify and Hijack in the same http.Server (sharing the same client connection pool).\r\n\r\nCloseNotify is essential to a production server (protecting it from continuing to work when the client goes away). At the same time, Hijack is required for Websocket or just general HTTP Upgrade support. As a result, it's impossible to run an http.Server that has both production-ready support for regular HTTP requests, and also support for Websockets/HTTP upgrade.\r\n\r\nPlease read the original issue and let me know if anything is poorly explained :v:",
