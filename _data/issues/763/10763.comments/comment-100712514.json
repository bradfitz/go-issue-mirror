(4.41-\u003e3.31s best of 5 times).  I think it's particularly bad for external linking, but linking godoc still improves from 1.97s to 1.79s (about 9%, again best of 5). The change makes almost no difference when -w is passed to disable dwarf.\r\n\r\nI don't know that this bug contributes especially much to the slowness of all.bash as dwarf is not produced when you run go test pkg. It does add a few seconds to the make.bash part I guess.",
