It is about the consistency of the description.\n\nLet me quote the whole section \"Qualified identifiers\":\n\n\n---\n\nA qualified identifier is a non-blank identifier qualified by a package name prefix.\n\nQualifiedIdent = [ PackageName \".\" ] identifier .\n\nA qualified identifier accesses an identifier in a different package, which must be\nimported. The identifier must be exported and declared in the package block of that\npackage.\n\nmath.Sin\t// denotes the Sin function in package math\"\n\n---\n\n\nSo it talks only about truly qualified identifiers, i.e. those declared in a different\npackage and imported. The semantics of unqualified identifiers (i.e. declared in the\ncurrent package) are not described.\n\nOTOH, the brackets in QualifiedIdent rule imply that the case of an unqualified\nidentifier is reflected as well. But those brackets are not explained. The reader of the\nspec can only guess what are the semantics of QualifiedIdent with package name prefix\nomitted. The spec is incomplete in this regard.\n\nActually I doubt this inconsistency is intentional. I suppose it was done mistakenly and\ncan be fixed e.g. by changing Operand and QualifiedIdent rules to:\n\nOperand = Literal | identifier | QualifiedIdent | MethodExpr | \"(\" Expression \")\" .\nQualifiedIdent = PackageName \".\" identifier .\n\nOr maybe the syntax rules should be left as is but the text description in \"Qualified\nidentifiers\" should handle the case of an unqualified identifier.\n\nAny comments from Go authors?\u003c/pre\u003e",
