The current behavior uses the magic string \"json\", and it would be\nnice to be able to change this. This would give the nice behavior without promoting use\nof multiple tags by having it be on an exported function.\n\nThe problem with the prior suggestion of using MarshalJSON() is that *every* type that\nembeds a type that implements it would have to implement it as well:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/B5W8uMs3bA\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/B5W8uMs3bA\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI understand the opposition to polluting tags, but perhaps there's a way to go mid-way?\nIf this idea isn't acceptable either, perhaps an interactive marshal would work (kind of\nlike flag's Visit)? This would allow doing something like MarshalJSON, but on a\nper-field basis.\u003c/pre\u003e",
