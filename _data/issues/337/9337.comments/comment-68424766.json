My supposition is that the proliferation of comment based control mechanisms is a symptom of something that is missing, namely a way to associate metadata with files, packages, and programs. I would make a proposal but I suspect it would be rejected. There seems to be some denial going on here.\r\n\r\n2. If I had to add one flag to the compiler it would be \"-noopt\" or turn off all possible optimizations. For whatever reason I've found many compiler/optimizer bugs in my life.. the ability to turn off all optimization has saved my ass more than any other flag.\r\n\r\n3. The current compiler has a ways to go before anyone can claim that it is doing the right thing. Just the other night I tried for create a very low overhead generic dispatch mechanism. You can't easily do it in Go. The core of any fast dispatch mechanism is usually a function with a switch statement that uses contiguous integers to create an indirect dispatch table that can be inlined. I don't even know if Go does the latter, but switch doesn't inline so even if it does, you can't get low overhead. *Sigh*\r\n\r\n4. As far as \"revisit the built-in settings for hariness and level\" I would say level needs to be 6 and hairiness has to be over 1,000. Is anyone willing to do that?\r\n\r\n5. Enhancing the inliner to inline closures and switch statements would also be very helpful. I honestly believe there could be a lot of bang for the buck in doing all this as far as performance goes. Another way to say it is there is low hanging fruit here.",
