It's not done by the inliner,\nit's recognized in the walkrotate() function in cmd/gc/walk.c\nFor unconstrained rotates, it does need to do a lot additional\nchecks. Blindly using the rotate instruction might not what the\nuser wants.\n\nFortunately, most modern crypto/hashing algorithms use constant\nrotates, so i don't think recognizing variable rotate matters that\nmuch.\n\nI agree that inlining of function closure that doesn't escape will\nbe very beneficial. I certainly used it a lot.",
