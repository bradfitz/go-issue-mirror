I'm willing to go\nso far as to do some\ncompression to reduce the Go binary size. We definitely shouldn't just\nblindly increase the level\nand hairiness)\n\nAlso, just because a function could be inlined, that doesn't mean we should\ninline it. GCC has\nfairly complex heuristics regarding when to inline and when not to inline.\n\nPS: any non-leaf function will likely remain to be not inlined, otherwise\nthat will change the stack\ntrace, and we value debuggability better than raw performance there.",
