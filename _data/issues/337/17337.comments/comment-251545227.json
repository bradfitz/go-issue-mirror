It would be better to not have a work around at all, and the test runner do the right thing by default.\r\n\r\nMy own version was just to set the timeout to 20 hours, which is arguably not good either.  @dsnet mentioned in his bug that it isn't straightforward, but I think it should still be solved (by me maybe, if there is agreement that it's a problem).",
