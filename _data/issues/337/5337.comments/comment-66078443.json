I'll also ask my colleague to\njoin us here, since he know a lot more about our production setup than I do.\n\n1. We're using supervisord for process management. I think we can rule out any\nswallowing of errors, since the last crash happened after my colleague started the\nprocess by hand in a terminal (see #20).\n\n2. Yes, I can. I'm going to send you an email with a link to it in a moment.\n\n3. According to gdb (when analyzing the core dump) the process is terminated with signal\n11. See my original post above. I'm going to ask my colleague to answer the rest of your\nquestion.\n\n4. No and neither do our dependencies (see original post). I've confirmed this by\nrunning an rgrep on the source. If there's a better way to find out if cgo is used in a\nbinary, please let me know.\n\n5. No, we haven't. Do you think this is worthwile to try?\n\n6. I don't understand what you mean. Do you mean not using cgo (we don't) or is there\nsome kind of compiler flag to disable cgo (a quick search didn't reveal anything)?\n\n7. The server has 96 GB RAM. Other processes include haproxy and a bunch of Python\nprocesses (Tornado web servers, I think). My colleague will provide more info. RES/RSS\nstarts out at 4-5 GB and grows steadily (we do daily restarts). The highest I've seen\nwas 12-14GB I think. This is way too much and subject to ongoing optimization.\n\nI hope this helps. Thanks a lot.\u003c/pre\u003e",
