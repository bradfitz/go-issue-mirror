The means that the pc value is 0x20 bytes into fmt.(*pp).printReflectValue. \nLooking at an executable here, that is immediately after the call to runtime.morestack01\nin the prologue.  printReflectValue in my executable has a frame size of 0xa88, which is\nconsistent with what we see in yours.\n\nMy working assumption is that the program received a signal for some reason.  The\nruntime then tried to print the trace back for that signal.  It crashed while trying to\nprint the traceback.\n\nWere you ever able to reproduce the crash with the environment variable GOTRACEBACK set\nto 2?  It would be very interesting to know whether the traceback managed to print\nanything at all.\u003c/pre\u003e",
