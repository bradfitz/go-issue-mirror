After I last posted here last week,\nwe were running as root by accident and failed to produce any crashes. When my colleague\nmade the connection and changed it to non-root, he was able to get quite a few crashes\nin a short time.\nMight be that the crash can only happen when running as non-root.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5337/7/panic.tar.gz\"\u003epanic.tar.gz\u003c/a\u003e (399560 bytes)",
