I'll\nreport back when something happens. (might take a while, as I said, whole days have gone\nby without crashes).\n\nWe are indeed using runtime/pprof.\n\nRegarding the TLS variables, I wasn't able to find a way to access those. I'm very\ninexperienced with gdb though, so someone else might have more luck. If someone can\nthink of a way to get the values of those, please let me know.\u003c/pre\u003e",
