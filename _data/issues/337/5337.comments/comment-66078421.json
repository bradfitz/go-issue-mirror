In retrospect it's not surprising that you are not seeing a stack trace, as gdb\nis showing that the crash happens in the code that is supposed to generate a stack\ntrace.  Still, setting GOTRACEBACK ought to print something, and that may help identify\nthe problem.  It should be printed on stderr.\n\nThe crash appears to be happening when the program receives a SIGPROF signal, so\npresumably you are importing runtime/pprof or net/http/pprof.  The gdb backtrace is\nshowing the backtrace up to the signal handler.  The Go backtrace should show the\nbacktrace of the currently executing Go code, and will hopefully be more informative.\n\nOne thing you could do within gdb is print the values of the TLS variables m and g, and\nalso *m and *g.  I don't know if you can print those from a core dump, though.\u003c/pre\u003e",
