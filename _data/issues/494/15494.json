	"body": "Using net/http ReverseProxy server and encountering cases where it would be ideal to reject HTTP requests that exceed a **request-line** greater than some configurable value.\r\n\r\nAccording to the RFC and request-line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRequest-Line   = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF\r\n```\r\nthere is no predefined limit on the request line size, so the http server in go is doing the right thing.\r\n\r\nHowever scenarios such as plain old invalid requests or potentially malicious requests with large payloads, it would be ideal to have the option to cap the **request-line** and return a 400 - Bad Request.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on potentially providing optional support to have a max length request line?\r\n\r\nCheers",
