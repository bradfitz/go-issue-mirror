The first doesn't seem very interesting to me.\nThe third point is a feature that we should explore further.\n\nThis issue should be about the third point only. Can you please file issues for the\nother two points? I would especially like as much information as you have about the\nsecond point.\n\nThanks\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
