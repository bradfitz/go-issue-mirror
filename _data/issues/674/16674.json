	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)? __1.6.3 x386__ (although no issue for older versions like 1.3.3 x386; no issues for 64-bit version of 1.6.3).  Unfortunately, circumstances require that I use 32-bit in order to connect to legacy database...\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n    Windows 64, however I have to use x386 version of Go due to legacy database that is 32-bit\r\n\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nTried to compile a simple program (like \"hello world\" simple).  Since I don't have admin rights on this machine, had to download / use binary Go compiler.  So, I have to build with a command like `c:\\go\\bin\\go.exe build`.  This has worked with previous versions of Go.  Here's the error message I get when I try building :  `go build command-line-arguments: c:\\go\\pkg\\tool\\windows_386\\compile.exe: exit status 1073741855`\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nNo error\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nUsing version 1.6:\r\n`go build command-line-arguments: c:\\go\\pkg\\tool\\windows_386\\compile.exe: exit status 1073741855`\r\n\r\n__Take away:__ There is some issue with Windows x386 version that did not exist previously.  Thanks!",
