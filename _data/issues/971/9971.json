	"body": "(I have been working on this for a few days now, creating a bug for the curious.) There are several problems with darwin/arm builder.\r\n\r\nFixed:\r\n\r\n- go_darwin_arm_exec: needs to serialize access to ios-deploy\r\n- go_darwin_arm_exec: not passing test arguments (in particular, -test.short=true)\r\n- cmd/go: tests need to be compiled with cgo\r\n- iOS 8.1.3: required a different Entitlements.plist format (discovered via trial and error)\r\n- crypto/x509: no access to certs\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- go_darwin_arm_exec: get it reviewed and submit\r\n- go_darwin_arm_exec: check that testdata is being copied into the app properly\r\n- on an iPhone 4S builder, sometimes: fatal error: runtime: cannot reserve arena virtual address space\r\n  considering falling back to a 128mb heap, trying to determine the consequences\r\n",
