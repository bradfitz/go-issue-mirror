	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhen running \u0026quot;go tool nm\u0026quot; on a compiled binary, many symbols are shown that\nare missing the first character. For example, there are a bunch of \u0026quot;untime\u0026quot;\nsymbols present, and show up at the end of the list.\n\nThis issue is present elsewhere shown by other tools. The system's \u0026quot;nm\u0026quot; tool\nshows the same symbols with equally broken names, and when profiling, it makes it\nannoying to isolate a package using regexps because instead of \u0026quot;weblist main\u0026quot;,\nto see all my main package functions, I have to \u0026quot;weblist ain\u0026quot;.\n\nI'm not sure of an exact procedure to cause this issue, as functions in both\n\u0026quot;untime\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;runtime\u0026quot; can exist in the binary at once, but it seems\nto happen a lot to anonymous functions.\n\nFor example: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/73KeNq5BM1\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/73KeNq5BM1\u003c/a\u003e , all the anonymous functions are\n\u0026quot;ain.func.*\u0026quot; while the main function is \u0026quot;main.main\u0026quot;.\n\nTested at tip on darwin/amd64 as well as in the hombrew version of go1.3.3 .\u003c/pre\u003e",
