	"body": "@crawshaw the argument for fixed point types is that floating point is simply more complicated: NaNs, negative zeros, adding non-zero values can be no-ops, adding then subtracting x can be lossy, etc.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, integer arithmetic is integer arithmetic. The only difference here is that the semantics is that the atomic unit is 1/64 of a pixel, not a pixel. Also, rounding to the nearest pixel is a simple bit mask.\r\n\r\nI repeat that freetype-go already has this concept, since https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM02/Chap2.html#performing_arithmetic says that \"arithmetic is done on 26.6 fixed point numbers\".\r\n\r\nI also repeat that WebKit and Blink use 26.6 as their fundamental unit, not float32.",
