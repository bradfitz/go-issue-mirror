	"body": "@ianlancetaylor I skimmed that document, and their _Accum concept looks broadly similar, although the position of the actual fixed point differs. Section A.3 suggests that 8.8, 16.16 or 8.24 might be the closest thing to this proposal's 26.6, but note that, like C's \"int\" meaning different things to different compilers, their \"_Accum\" can mean a different number of fractional bits to different compilers. For this proposal, fixed.Int26 means exactly 26.6, regardless of your Go compiler.",
