	"body": "@davecheney \u0026 @bradfitz - you're correct, it was an issue with it dynamically looking for a library. I wasn't aware that the stdlib (I think net/http) used cgo by default on Linux. I misread the error message as it saying that \"`$BINARY` was not there\", when the error was actually emitted by Go itself.\r\n`no such file or directory` is in `syscall/zerrors...`. \r\n\r\nAfter finding out that Linux code isn't actually statically linked, I found a lot of threads and projects that got bit by this same error. It would have been much easier to track down if there had been better logging, letting me know that a dependency wasn't found, rather than a generic `no such file or directory`.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping me track that down!",
