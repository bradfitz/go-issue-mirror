	"body": "@rsc, thanks for your response. First of all, I wanted to ensure that the problem was still present on master (before applying the suggested changes), so I compiled Go from the tip and ran my program. I tortured it for some time by occasionally restarting, and it reported a calculation error just like in February.\r\n\r\nWith C outside of the infinite loop and regardless of GOGC, the program still reports errors. It takes subjectively more time. To make sure that I disable the GC properly, I ran the program with C inside the infinite loop and GOGC=off, and, as expected, it sucked all 23G of RAM quite quickly.\r\n\r\nProbably it is something other than the GC, and it might be not Goâ€™s fault at all.",
