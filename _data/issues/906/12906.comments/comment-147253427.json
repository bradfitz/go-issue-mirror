I think we do that because the sigignore function was copied from sigenable, which does correctly skip signals that can not be notified.\r\n\r\nLooking at the os/signal package now, though, I'm a bit puzzled: it looks like once you call Ignore, you can call Notify, but Reset doesn't seem to restore an Ignore'd signal back to the default behavior.",
