	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version devel +3e9264c Tue Apr 19 09:21:57 2016 +0000 linux/ppc64le\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n./go env\r\nGOARCH=\"ppc64le\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"ppc64le\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOPATH=\"\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/home/boger/golang/md5/go\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/home/boger/golang/md5/go/pkg/tool/linux_ppc64le\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -pthread -fmessage-length=0 -fdebug-prefix-map=/tmp/go-build014718722=/tmp/go-build -gno-record-gcc-switches\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\nNo error, just improving the performance of the md5 block function when used on ppc64le.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nBetter performance.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nPerformance with opportunities for improvement.\r\n\r\nI have a change to improve the performance of the crypto/md5 block function when built and run on ppc64le.  This change provides an improvement of 3-4.76X when using golang with the enhanced implementation of this function.\r\n\r\nThis is only being done for ppc64le and not ppc64 because:\r\n1) The implementation for big endian uses byte reverse indexed instructions which are not correctly supported by the plan9 assembler for ppc64.\r\n2) Performance on ppc64 is not as important as for ppc64le, especially since ppc64 still does not support external linking and therefore can't be used to build production applications.\r\n\r\n",
