	"body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but it seems it's not possible to get the checksums of Go downloads without actually parsing a whole HTML page?\r\n\r\nMy expected behavior to download Go and it's checksum would be:\r\n```\r\nwget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz\r\nwget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the checksum is not there, the only place I can find it is hardcoded into the HTML of the download page (probably autogenerated during a build I assume). \r\n\r\nI would like to do this download from a script and that's why manually copying the checksum is a bit tedious.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how it's possible to download and verify Dart's SDK download:\r\n```\r\n# Example of how to download and verify the Dart SDK\r\nmkdir /tmp/download\r\ncd /tmp/download\r\nwget https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/stable/release/1.14.2/sdk/dartsdk-linux-x64-release.zip\r\nwget https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/stable/release/1.14.2/sdk/dartsdk-linux-x64-release.zip.sha256sum\r\nsha256sum -c dartsdk-linux-x64-release.zip.sha256sum\r\ncd -\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add so that checksums are served up in the golang storage bucket?",
