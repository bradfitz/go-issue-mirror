What\nhappens is when the new time parser parses it, it checks if the time and timezone would\nbe a valid time in your local timezone. If it is then it sets the Time.loc to Local,\notherwise it uses a FixedZone. The test checks it with reflect.DeepEquals so even though\nboth values have the same effect, they are not the same as far as the test is concerned.\u003c/pre\u003e",
