Revoke a TLS certificate (for example, to mitigate Heartbleed)\n2. Attempt to prevent a golang client from securing a connection using the revoked\ncertificate\n3. Realize you can verify the hostname, but not other parts of the certificate prior to\nestablishing a connection and sending a request.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nGolang clients cannot currently be written to reject certificates based on factors other\nthan hostname.\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nThe certificate should be available to client code when establishing connections to\nallow for more granular verification. The attached file is client code which could be\nused to reject blacklisted certs if a hook were available in net/http.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/8522/0/certblacklist.go\"\u003ecertblacklist.go\u003c/a\u003e (932 bytes)",
