They all affect different phases\nof the request.\n\nTimeout is documented to say:\n\n        // Timeout specifies a time limit for requests made by this\n        // Client. The timeout includes connection time, any\n        // redirects, and reading the response body. The timer remains\n        // running after Get, Head, Post, or Do return and will\n        // interrupt reading of the Response.Body.\n        //\n        // A Timeout of zero means no timeout.\n\nThe way you were doing it before with DialTimeout is totally different.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
