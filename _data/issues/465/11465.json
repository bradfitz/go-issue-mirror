	"body": "Currently we perform delayed stack frees during mark termination while the world is stopped. As far as I can tell, there's no reason this needs to be done with the world stopped (except possibly for statistics), so we should move it after the world is started again. It does need to be done before we start another GC cycle, so it should probably be done before releasing the worldsema.\r\n\r\n@RLH ",
