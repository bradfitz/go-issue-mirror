For example, it says that \"% x\" puts spaces between the elements, which implies the first element should not have a space before it, and I believe that is correct and desired behavior, while on the other hand it says the format applies to all elements, which presumably applies to the first.\r\n\r\nThis is not an urgent issue and resolving it may break some things, so I am deferring it until 1.6.\r\n",
