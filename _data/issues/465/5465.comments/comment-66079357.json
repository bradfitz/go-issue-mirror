Current the\nRequest.Header field is useless if the request might get redirected. See \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/5782\"\u003eissue #5782\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nMaybe something like a func(*Request) field in the request, that gets called on this\nrequest and each redirected one before it gets sent?\u003c/pre\u003e",
