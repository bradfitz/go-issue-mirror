	"body": "I wish there was a way to delegate URL path subtrees to another handler in a way where recipient doesn't have to specifically understand the whole path, but can still easily do redirects and such. A convention for \"this is the unprocessed part of the path\".\r\n\r\nFor example, try using the same handler for `/foo/` and `/bar/quux/`, having the handler extract the immediate child segment as a numeric ID, doing a database lookup, and creating a redirect to a canonical non-numerically named child (e.g. http://macworld.com/article/2367748 )\r\n\r\nRight now, mutating `Request.URL.Path` (like `StripPrefix`) destroys knowledge of the requested URL (and re-parsing `Request.RequestURI` seems wrong).",
