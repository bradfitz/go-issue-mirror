	"body": "by **camilo.aguilar**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI have a http client that used to work fine in Go 1.2.1 and now it does not in Go 1.3.\nBasically the timeout is always kicking in the middle of a transfer. For example, when\ndownloading or uploading a big file. \n\nI also tried using the new Timeout property in http.Client instead of doing\nconn.SetDeadline and I'm having the same results.\n\nWhat does 'go version' print?\ngo version go1.3 darwin/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nJust use http.Client to get a big file from somewhere, the total transfer time should\ntake more than the time defined in Timeout.\n\nWhat happened?\nTimeout kicks in on an established connection\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\nTimeout should not kick in at all if the connection is in established state\u003c/pre\u003e",
