Parsing\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com:443/\"\u003ehttp://www.google.com:443/\u003c/a\u003e sets host to www.google.com:443; we might as well be\nconsistent.\n\nIt might be helpful to change the URL parsing code instead of bypassing it. \"URL\"s\nwithout schemes are common enough that it would be nice if we could do something\nsensible with them. (Assume HTTP for parsing purposes, but leave the scheme blank to\nshow it wasn't specified?) The difficult part would be coming up with a way to trigger\nthis behavior if and only if it's needed. IE's behavior of accepting host:port when host\nis an IP address but complaining about an unknown scheme when you go to localhost:8080\nis rather confusing. (Safari seems to do better, but I don't know what rules they use.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
