That golang-nuts thread points to a\nthird party library (nfnt/resize) that is designed very abstractly, with interfaces and\nclosures, and it seems orders of magnitude slower than it could be.\n\nIt's not obvious whether there exists an API design that is all three of clean, easy to\nuse, and efficient. Until a proposal exists, I'm not keen on committing anything to the\nstandard library, with its backwards compatibility guarantees.\n\nBesides, I don't see why this has to be in the standard library and not a \"go get\"table\nthird party library.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
