I must have written it off initially because I assumed they were false\npositives for \"example [testing] functions\", not actual code examples.  (It probably\ndoesn't help that examples don't import package testing either.)\n\nPerhaps a cross-reference from \"Godoc: documenting Go code\" would be good for improving\ndiscoverability?  Something like \"Godoc recognizes example code written according to\npackage testing's naming conventions and tries to present it appropriately.\"\u003c/pre\u003e",
