If you read the comment inside\nnet/lookup.go, there is no throttling and each lookup is handled with a timeout thread,\nso if there is even a tiny blip in your dns server,or the name is slow to resolve you'll\nblow you thread limit quickly.\n\nAlternatively you could\n\na. compile with cgo disabled, this is my recommendation\nb. switch to github.com/miekg/dns for dns resoltion, then pass a *net.TCPAddr to\nnet.DialTCP\n\nMaking as accepted, but leaving priority as triage for now, I do not know the correct\npriority to apply to this.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
