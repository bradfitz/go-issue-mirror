The reason your code crashed was there were over 500 threads doing dns lookups.\nBecause Go uses the hosts' dns resolver by default on linux, each of these lookups\nconsumes a thread as cgo always runs on an operating system thread, not a goroutine.\nThis has exhausted the number of threads allowed by the ulimit of the user you were\nrunning as. I would *not* recommend raising this limit as a stop gap, this will only\nmake things worse as the system resolver will crap out if you have more than 1024 FD's\nopen in your program.\n\nIs the code to this custom transport available ?\n        /usr/lib/go/src/pkg/net/dial.go:138 +0xa5\ngithub.com/adeven/adjust_backend/callback_worker.dialWithTimeout(0x76e010, 0x3,\n0xc263588b80, 0x14, 0x0, ...)\n        /home/callback_worker/app/releases/20130525213259/callback_worker/run/.go/src/github.com/adeven/adjust_backend/callback_worker/callback_consumer.go:96 +0x196\nnet/http.(*Transport).dial(0xc2002d4f80, 0x76e010, 0x3, 0xc263588b80, 0x14, ...)\n        /usr/lib/go/src/pkg/net/http/transport.go:382 +0x87\u003c/pre\u003e",
