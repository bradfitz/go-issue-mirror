But\nsituation with network Read/Write and Connect is very different. Unlike Read/Write,\nConnect only executed on clients, so it is unlikely you will have large number of\nConnects in one single time. I do not know what you re doing, but if you are worried\nabout your thread count, perhaps you could serialize all your Connects in one (or many)\ndedicated goroutine.\n\nPerhaps, I am still missing something. Feel free to correct my thinking.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
