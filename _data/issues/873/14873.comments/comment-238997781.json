	"body": "Ok.  My apologies for not following procedure.\r\n\r\nWhat about taking the following approach.  I replace all the IoctlGetXxx and IoctlSetXxx functions with the following:\r\n\r\n    func IoctlGet(fd int, req int) (uintptr, error)\r\n    func IoctlSet(fd int, req int, value uintptr) (error)\r\n\r\nThe only exception would be that I am inclined to leave the IoctlGetString and IoctlSetString functions in place to handle the conversion to/from Go strings, since that is more involved than a type conversion.\r\n",
