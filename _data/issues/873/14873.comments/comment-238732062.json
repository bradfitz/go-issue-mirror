Proposals should be handled faster, and that is not your fault.\r\n\r\nMy point is that I don't want to see ioctl get helpers to make it look nice. It really doesn't need int and uint and *Termio and *Whatever helpers. The caller can do the conversion. It may be uglier but it will actually be faster, and anyway ioctl is hideous and I prefer not to hide that fact.",
