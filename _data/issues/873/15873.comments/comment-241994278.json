	"body": "I am running into the exact same problem in one of our microservices. The only thing we were able to observe is that some network polling fails before it happens, but that might or might not be related.\r\n\r\nI searched the entire code base (including vendored libraries), and the only place where it calls `os.Exit(0)` is an the end of the main function. Before it exits, there are a few lines of log output which are never written.\r\n\r\nIt simply shouldn't be possible for the application to exit with `code 0` and have no output at all, other than normal operation. This is blocking our deployment big time right now.\r\n\r\nIt happens on a timescale of several hours to several days, so it's really hard to track anything down.",
