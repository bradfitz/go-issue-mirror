I found that my hack actually makes it more difficult to figure out the true cause\nof the error. In some cases it's better to have the location in the Test function, while\nin others you want to know where in the helper function the test failed. Something like\n\"my_test.go:63:591: a != b\" makes it very easy to track down the problem by giving you\nall the relevant line numbers without dumping a full stack trace.\u003c/pre\u003e",
