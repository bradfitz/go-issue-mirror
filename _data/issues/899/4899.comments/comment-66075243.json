You could change the decorate\nfunction instead to look through all stack frames starting at 3 and concatenate all line\nnumbers that are in the current _test.go file. If t.Error(\"something\") is called in a\nTest function, then the output stays as it is right now. But if it's called from a\nhelper function, then you get two or more line numbers, starting in the Test function\nand working your way through all the helpers.\u003c/pre\u003e",
