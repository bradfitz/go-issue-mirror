(it has others, but they aren't related\nto this discussion - dwarf sections and \"dll imports\" section). .gopclntab Section is\nnot pe section, but is part of \".text\" pe section. There is nothing in Go pe file that\nidentify .gopclntab Section inside of \".text\" pe section. I can see .gosymtab is empty\nand not used (just like you say), so we only need to worry about .gopclntab.\n\nI started looking for a symbol that points to .gopclntab Section (address and length),\nbut I cannot find any. I can see pclntab/epclntab symbols, but these live in bss (part\nof \".data\" pe section), and I don't see how they can be useful.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
