But we have never output these. I really don't\nknow what to do here. I don't want to start rewriting cmd/ld code now. Perhaps there is\na symbol in our symbol table that can point me to .gosymtab and .gopclntab. But I looked\nhard and I don't see it. Perhaps I can add these symbols, but I don't know how. Looking\nfor suggestions. Thank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
