At that time it would have been even more awkward to generate DWARF in the compiler. Clearly, though, in the future we should generate DWARF in the compiler, if for no other reason than that it would make builds slightly faster.\r\n\r\nInteresting. That makes sense. I suppose there are still some advantages to doing this in the linker, like that we don't generate DWARF at all for unused symbols and that we don't have to worry about deduplicating the DWARF for equivalent types (this is less of an issue than in C, but would still come up for, e.g., *package.T).",
