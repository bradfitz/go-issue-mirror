	"body": "@aclements the advantage of the DW_AT_decl_* attrs is that the debugger can know where a specific variable was declared, most importantly in relation to where the debugger has stopped the program. It comes into play for commands such as `locals` which will print all local variables in scope. The debugger needs a way to omit uninitialized variables so it doesn't display garbage.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for the pointers on the scope issue, I'll dig into that some more!",
