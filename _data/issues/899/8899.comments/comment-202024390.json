It does not support blocking and unblocking of goroutines (you must not just spin, but tell scheduler precisely when a goroutine can be descheduled and marked as blocked, and when it must be made runnable again).\r\n5. The same applies to select: you must not just poll in a loop, you need to tell scheduler when to block and unblock the goroutine.\r\n\r\n",
