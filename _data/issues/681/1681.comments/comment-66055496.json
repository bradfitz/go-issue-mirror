I could always do \"(\u0026t).Foo()\" if I desired this behavior.\n\nTo me, this seems on par with having a \"func Bar(p *T)\" work with \"var t T; Bar(t)\".\n\nWasn't \"always explicit, never implicit\" part of the motto?\n\nPerhaps the spec should be reworded to make it clear that code like this should work.\u003c/pre\u003e",
