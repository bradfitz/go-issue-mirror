	"body": "\u003e Go 1.5.1 on OS X 10.10.5 with Xcode 7\r\n\r\nIt appears Go builds c archives with absolute addressing, which makes Xcode unhappy when using the resulting static library in a project:\r\n```\r\n(null): PIE disabled. Absolute addressing (perhaps -mdynamic-no-pic) not allowed in code signed PIE, but used in __cgoexp_45a75e65c81e_Test from build/iphoneos/main.a(go.o). To fix this warning, don't compile with -mdynamic-no-pic or link with -Wl,-no_pie\r\n```\r\n\r\nI made a sample test project here: https://github.com/swisspol/Go-Bridge",
