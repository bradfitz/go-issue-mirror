	"body": "As mentioned in #16623, I propose the opposite approach: instead of trying to push cmd/cgo earlier, let's push the C compilations later.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only reason we have to wait for the C sources to finish compiling is so we can run cmd/cgo -dynimport and generate a bunch of `//go:cgo_import_dynamic` directives.  But cmd/compile doesn't actually need these directives: it simply stashes them into the compiled package artifact so cmd/link can find them.\r\n\r\nIf cmd/go was responsible for saving the directives instead, we could run cmd/compile immediately after the first cmd/cgo run.  Then Go package compilation would never be blocked waiting on C compilations, and C compilations could all run in parallel only blocking any link operations that depend on them.",
