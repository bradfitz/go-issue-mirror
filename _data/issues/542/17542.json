	"body": "The idea is to add `-test.report=junit` flag to `go test`, which will produce `gotests.xml` in current directory (borrowed from https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/xunit.html#options).\r\n\r\nThis is an extension of #2981 (and this specific https://github.com/golang/go/issues/2981#issuecomment-66062807 by @alberts).\r\n\r\n**Why xUnit/JUnit first and not JSON?**\r\n\r\nJSON is not a specification for testing, so services like AppVeyor [can't support it](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/running-tests/#uploading-xml-test-results).\r\n\r\n**Why write report to file instead of streaming it to the screen?**\r\n\r\nBecause screen is for humans and report are for robots. It is very inconvenient to sacrifice one for another with pipe formatters like https://github.com/jstemmer/go-junit-report and https://github.com/tebeka/go2xunit because there is no `tee` on Windows.\r\n",
