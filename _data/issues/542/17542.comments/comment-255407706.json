Our goal is to implement a single well-specified output format for Go, and you can then use whatever converter you want on that output. I don't understand why this makes it difficult to use AppVeyor?\r\n\r\nThere is a kernel of an interesting idea here, however, which is to support both structured output and human-readable output at the same time. That has been mentioned obliquely on #2981, but feel free to raise this request explicitly.",
