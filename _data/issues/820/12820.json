This should not have\r\nhappened (and letting it happen was partly my fault).\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean? github.com/golang/tools is becoming read only? Or is just no more updates to golang.org/x/tools packages which is, well, exactly the same.\r\n\r\nJust wondering, which repository for vet tool is recommend/correct to use?\r\n\r\nJan",
