Just use d.Memstats.Alloc if d is a *read.Dump.\n\nI get an MemStats.Alloc of 124MB.  There are only three objects in the dump with \"ssa\"\nin their type name, and they are all ssa.Const.\n\nThere are a few objects in the dump which are unreachable.  I need to find out why that\nis.  But they are all untyped (probably pointerless or runtime internal) and there are\nonly a few thousand of them using a total of 1MB.\u003c/pre\u003e",
