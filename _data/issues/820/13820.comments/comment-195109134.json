There are cases where the amount of entropy needed is very high thus a local PRNG can make sense. It's possible that someone is hitting that and, given evidence of a problem, we might want to ponder the best option. But, short of that, I think the simple and safe behaviour is good.\r\n\r\n(*) Assuming that the migration bothers to address the duplication of the kernel's entropy pools.",
