It's best effort, and the effort doesn't have to be very good.\n\nAnother possible fix, if this really matters, is to edit gosched instead of gput. Right\nnow it says:\n\n\truntime路mcall(schedule);\n\nIt could instead say:\n\n\tif(g-\u003elockedm) {\n\t\truntime路entersyscall();\n\t\truntime路exitsyscall();\n\t} else\n\t\truntime路mcall(schedule);\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
