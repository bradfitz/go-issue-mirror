	"body": "by **jtolds**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eCurrently, Go's server TLS implementation requires clientAuth extendedKeyUsage on any\nclient certificate when client verification is enabled, with no way to turn it off and\nstill have client certificate verification. (handshake_server.go, processCertsFromClient)\n\nHowever, from RFC5280:\n\n\u0026quot;Certificate using applications MAY require that the extended key usage extension\nbe present and that a particular purpose be indicated in order for the certificate to be\nacceptable to that application.\u0026quot;\n\nThis says to me that a specific application should be able to choose this behavior, not\nhave it be forced on them by the TLS library.\n\nSpecifically, OpenSSL does *not* require this.\n\nCan we make this optional, or perhaps only require the clientAuth extendedKeyUsage iff\nthe extendedKeyUsage field is actually used and not the default empty? Or even better,\nsupport verify callbacks like OpenSSL or GnuTLS?\u003c/pre\u003e",
