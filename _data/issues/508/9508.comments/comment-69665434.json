An AndroidManifest.xml is not a Makefile. Go ideology you mention above is mostly in the scope of building a binary. From that point on, it's not that opinionated. (I don't think the apk/app builder should ever go in go build, but should be a separate tool on the other hand.)\r\n\r\nI don't think at the current stage, it's any worthy to think about how we will represent this stuff in vanilla Go. Reusing AndroidManifest or generating one sounds fair to me.",
