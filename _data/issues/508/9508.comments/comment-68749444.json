I guess this similarly true for screen orientation?\r\n\r\nI just a did a comparison of setting the fullscreen attribute in AndroidManifest.xml vs setting the fullscreen flag in app.Callbacks.Start and there is only the slightest difference in timing, it's hardly noticeable, I think it is negligible.\r\n\r\nRegarding the proposed configuration syntax: it'll be a bit wordy if every parameter needs golang.org/x/mobile/config as a prefix.  Also, it might not work so well for non-boolean parameters, should any arise.  How about //go:mobile foo=bar comments instead?",
