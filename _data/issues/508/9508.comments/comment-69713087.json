Go ideology you mention above is\n\u003e mostly in the scope of building a binary. From that point on, it's not that\n\u003e opinionated. I don't think apk/app builder should ever go in go build, but\n\u003e should be a separate tool.\n\u003e\nI agree that go build shouldn't handle the complete packaging of apps, but\nI think your argumentation could use some refinement.  A binary *is* an\narchive of (often mostly code) resources; and an Android app could just as\nwell have been packaged as a binary.  The difference is irrelevant.  What\nis relevant is what type of resource is packaged by what tool.  go build\nshould focus on packaging Go code resources (as it currently does).\n gomobile should focus on packaging a complete app.\n\n\u003e I don't think at the current stage, it's any worthy to think about how we\n\u003e will represent this stuff in vanilla Go. Reusing AndroidManifest or\n\u003e generating one sounds fair to me.\n\u003e\nI can understand waiting for a clearer picture to emerge before trying to\nabstract away app configuration.  But down the road it would be nice to\nhave a common mechanism, if it is practical.",
