	"body": "by **bronze1man**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the\nlatest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nAs a newer ,I want use Benchmark from go test to benchmark my function.\n\nhere is my test file:\n\npackage main\nimport \u0026quot;testing\u0026quot;\nfunc BenchmarkLoop(b *testing.B){\n    for i:=0;i\u0026lt;b.N;i++ {\n    }\n}\n\n\nBut I look around the doc, I still do not know how to run Benchmark.\n1.testing package says:\nFunctions of the form\n\nfunc BenchmarkXxx(*testing.B)\nare considered benchmarks, and are executed by the \u0026quot;go test\u0026quot; command when the\n-test.bench flag is provided.\n\n2.go test command says:\nThe test binary also accepts flags that control execution of the test; these flags are\nalso accessible by 'go test'. See 'go help testflag' for details.\n\n3.go help testflag says:\n-test.bench pattern\n    Run benchmarks matching the regular expression.\n    By default, no benchmarks run.\n\nthen I tried:\n1.rename my test file to benchmark_test.go\n2.put benchmark_test.go in a standalone directory.\n3.go test -test.bench ./\ndo not work.\n\n4.I tried again:(Do I forget regular expression?)\ngo test -test.bench * ./\ndo not work.\n\n5.I tried again:(regular expression!!!!)\ngo test -test.bench . ./\nIt works!\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nAn example in documents to tell me how to do benchmark.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nI guess three times.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nubuntu 1204 server 64bit\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.0.3\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
