The error reported is mostly about missing\narguments, not bad format verbs, so the complaint is malformed. But let's take it at\nface value with a proper example:\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"%w\\n\", 3)\n\nwhich gives\n\n%!w(int=3)\n\nThat seems like a reasonable error message. You get the erroneous verb reported, and the\nvalue is printed regardless. The provided example with arguments:\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\".%2a%3a4.1%3a29\\n\", 3, 4, 5)\n\nwhich gives\n\n.%!a(int= 3)%!a(int=  4)4.1%!a(int=  5)29\n\nI claim that's fine. Verbs in general cannot be outlawed, since a Formatter interface is\nallowed to take any verb at all. We could check that a Formatter is being used and then\ncomplain, but the way we complain wouldn't really be any different.\n\nWorking as intended.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
