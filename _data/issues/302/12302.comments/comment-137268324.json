If not, that would be a great exercise before ratifying this proposal.\r\n\r\nThis would be an informative experiment: set up a bunch of projects with version tags (they can be clones of existing projects) and use tools to manage the relationships between those projects using their version tags. One could ask the community for examples of particularly frustrating dependency versioning situations and reproduce them in a controlled environment. If we can really put this idea to the test *in the context of Go* then we can much better see whether it works for us.\r\n\r\nI am loathe to make a standard of something that has not been implemented. (And the use of semver tags by other popular package management tools does not count; Go \"projects\" are different.) I appreciate the narrow scope of the proposal, but small doesn't necessarily mean correct. Every one of us has thought we had a great design up front, only to find upon implementation that the devil is in the details.\r\n\r\nNote that I am not trying to stifle this proposal. On the contrary, I want it to be the best it can be. The ecosystem plays no-takes-backsies; once we do this we're stuck with it. Let's get stuck with the right thing.",
