	"body": "As a Debian Developer, Go user, and Docker project maintainer, I'm definitely very +1 to explicit versioning.  I'm not personally attached to any particular scheme (semver is nice), but having explicit points in time where a package maintainer has said \"I feel good enough about my library/program at this particular point in time to attach some extra meaning to it\" is really useful, even if they're simple monotonic increases like what systemd uses.\r\n\r\nAs a simplistic example, it's easy for users to say \"I'm on version 34 and hitting bug XYZ\" and the maintainer can respond with something simple for users to understand like \"that was fixed in version 36\".\r\n\r\nSemver specifically is nice when used properly, but it does apply a light layer of \"social contract\" between package authors and consumers such that (for example) version 1.0.0 and version 1.0.1 are \"compatible\" (for varying values of compatible, I suppose).\r\n\r\nThe fake VCS-based version numbers used in Debian can be useful (`0.0~git20150526.1.5478c06-1` for example), but IMO should only be necessary for snapshots between releases (such as `1.2.3~git20150526.1.5478c06-1`).",
