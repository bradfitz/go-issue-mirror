The churn of touching hundreds of files every time a project which is under active development by another part of the company changes it's public API is horrible. \r\n\r\nPutting that to one side, I don't believe that incrementing the major version number of a package should require it to be a new import path. APIs change, that is what semver is all about, but it's still your project whether it's version 1.1.2, or version 5.0.0. You should only change the import path when you fork project, because it is a _new_ thing, not a revision of the old thing. \r\n\r\n\u003e Suggest modifying \"Authors of Go projects who wish to release of their projects must tag their software using a tag in the form described above.\" to something less restrictive. If a library provider doesn't want to participate in the ecosystem that will be built around this standard, we won't be too upset, right? :-)\r\n\r\nThank you, i'll integrate that into my next draft.",
