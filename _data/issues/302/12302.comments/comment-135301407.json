Right now, few Go projects have a release process, and those that do use a tag format of their choosing. Because of this, no tools exist to mechanically consume release tags (although many tools exist that leave the problem of choosing the tag, branch or revision entirely to the user), hence there is no impetus to do releases.\r\n\r\nI think we're both saying the same thing, we both want to break this cycle.  You want a tool to be written first, and I want agreement on the format first, then the tool. I think my approach has a higher chance of achieving consensus as it requires no code change (yet), and will enable the entire Go ecosystem to benefit as soon as it is adopted, not when the tool, and I'm assuming you mean the go tool inside the Go distribution itself, ships.",
