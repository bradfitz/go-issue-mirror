A client ask me a software, I develop it, release it  and after some time I forget about it.  Suppose after a year the client call me telling he need a new feature or a bug fix: do you think I want to spend more time than necessary trying to update everything to the latest *revision*, checking that it *really* works?\r\n\r\nSemVer does not solve the problem, but it, with the aid of good tools, will make my life better.",
