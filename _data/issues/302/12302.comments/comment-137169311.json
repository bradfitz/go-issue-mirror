	"body": "I remain concerned about the word project. This is a new idea, and not an entirely obvious one. This versioning scheme won't work if projects ever span more than one repository, or if there are two projects in one repository. Do we know those cases never happen? I can certainly imagine ways they can happen.\r\n\r\nThe fast way to answer that question is a survey of existing projects to understand how this versioning scheme would change projects. The slow but sure way would be to first modify tools to work with this versioning scheme, and then see it widely adopted. If it is adopted, it works, and the proposal can be ratified. Generally with Go the standard has followed experimentation and use. I wish there were more concrete uses of project versioning to point to before telling everyone to do it a particular way.",
