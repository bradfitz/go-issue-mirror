It is rather an open ended question what else we may need to represent the dependency management related metadata.\r\n\r\nIf we bless a version file with a value as it is proposed above, will this solution last? Or will it become useless as vendoring tools become more advanced?\r\n\r\nVersioning and vendoring needs to be designed rather than being approached incrementally. Introducing a versioning system is an incremental step but will likely to be not sufficient enough in the future. I would rather like to see a clear plan around (a) how we version packages, (b) how packages declare their dependencies and (c) what other package metadata could be relevant in the future.\r\n\r\nAny half-baked solution will need to be deprecated and break many users in the future. The concerning voices on this thread are rather a reflection of this fact. I don't think we need a godoc demo that works with versioning or a new gb prototype, we need a doc that explains the state and the scope of the problem, concerns, several solutions, alternative strategies, etc.",
