	"body": "I asked a similar question to @rsc last week which boils down to: (1) what is your current vendor process? (2) What is currently problematic in your current process? (3) If everyone released and used semver, what could you envision your vendor process could be? \r\nhttps://forum.golangbridge.org/t/what-is-your-process-for-dealing-with-vendor-packages/1541\r\n\r\nI will be adding support for remote packages and potentially semver to govendor. However I don't really know what semver support will look like. I would love input on this.\r\n\r\n@perillo Without offering an opinion on the idea, I think that would be an independent proposal. Even if no semvers were used, a machine could very quickly check a range of revision hashes. Something like the vendor-spec could help you there record versions or revisions.\r\n",
