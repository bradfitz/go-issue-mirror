I recognise the rational for that, and the possibilities that would unlock.\r\n\r\nI also recognise that this would be much harder to explain to newcomers, much more nuanced for toolmakers, and ultimately a far more complex solution than I think is necessary. \r\n\r\nIf developers are unhappy with the granularity of a single version number series per repository, they should split the unrelated pieces out into independent repositories.\r\n\r\nIf this should be done for your examples of the crypto and net projects is outside the scope of this proposal.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nDave",
