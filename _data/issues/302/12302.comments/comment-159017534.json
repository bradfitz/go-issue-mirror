	"body": "@mattfarina, this is different from vendor/ in two important respects. (1)\nWe did know roughly where vendor/ was going, since people were already\nbuilding tools that kludged the behavior in via GOPATH modification, with\nthe side effect that \"go get\" couldn't work with these setups. (2) vendor/\nneeded to be supported in the main toolchain go command, precisely to give\nan alternate way to get the behavior of GOPATH modification without\nbreaking \"go get\".\n\nIn contrast, (1) we don't know where SemVer is going, because equivalents\nto 'godep' and the like don't seem to exist yet, and (2) it's unclear\nwhether this affects the go command at all. As stated the proposal is\nroughly \"state that SemVer is a good idea\". There's nothing concrete behind\nit right now: we don't know where we're going and we don't know what might\nneed changing in the go command.\n\nMy suggestion would be that people continue to experiment with SemVer\nsupport in tools like glide and gb, to learn answers to those questions.\nThose answers would inform this discussion considerably and help move the\nproposal from \"say it's good\" to \"do these specific things to support it\".\n",
