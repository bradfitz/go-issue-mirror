We can do the same.\r\n\r\nAs Peter mentioned, some alpha prefix may be required by some VCS systems, honestly, it probably comes down to personal taste and prior experience. Personally I don't like the v, it feels redundant, but it's that hand that has been dealt. \r\n\r\nAs I said in CL 14147, this is the format that the three biggest Go projects have arrived at and any standard that wanted their support would be poorly served by telling them out of the gate that they are doing it wrong, especially when they have received zero guidance, or assistance, from the go toolng up to this point.\r\n\r\nI will make sure the next draft of the release proposal includes these points and makes it clear that the v prefix is only for the tag form, it is not a modification to SemVer.",
