	"body": "@davecheney, thank you for the your explanation. I can now see that I completely misunderstood the scope of this proposal ;)\r\n\r\nI still think if a tool that works as you described appears (not necessary as part of Go distribution) and developers find it useful this proposal won't be necessary.\r\n\r\nSuch tool can be optionated of course (like gofmt) and choose to use SemVer, tag names with or without 'v' and it can always tag the whole repository. If it gives people functionality that they need it will be widely used. It would be really cool if it can print some advice how to avoid breaking API changes ;)",
