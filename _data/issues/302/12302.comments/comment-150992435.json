	"body": "@kardianos if I understand it correctly, if you change the API you change the import path in the current recommendation. SemVer changes the version. Do you expect that people would increment the major version number in SemVer and change the import path? Packages have branding. For example, do you think kubernetes or docker version 2 are going to change their location for the import path to change?\r\n\r\nFrom a practical point of view, every other package ecosystem increments version numbers to handle an API change. What benefit is there for Go to do this thing differently from everyone else?\r\n\r\nWhen Go 2 comes out will the standard library and it's API changes have new paths? For example, with the `net/http` package have a new path?\r\n\r\nI'm just trying to pluck out a practical path forward for the long tail of developers.",
