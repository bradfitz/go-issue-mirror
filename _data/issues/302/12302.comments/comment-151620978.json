I think it needs to be addressed to help folks be well rounded.\r\n\r\nI'm familiar with \"gopkg.in\". It has some shortcomings in practice. Even beyond the easy to solve (e.g., it's only for public things on GitHub.com). For example,`gopkg.in/natefinch/npipe.v2` doesn't say which point versions are ok to use. For example, v2.3.4 isn't exactly compatible with v2.5.6. The latter has features not in the former. If you use something like `gopkg.in/natefinch/npipe.v2.3.4` you need to rewrite imports when you bump versions. Now, take that rewriting to something large like k8s. It's not a friendly workflow.\r\n\r\nIf we look at every other package ecosystem they handle it differently. The developer workflow is easier. We should learn from others success.",
