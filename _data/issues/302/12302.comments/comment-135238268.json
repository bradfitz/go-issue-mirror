	"body": "@tianon, I didn't propose to include version number in the import path. What I said was that incompatible versions of the same package should be different packages (with different import paths). Though in practice this probably matters only for popular well established libraries used by many projects. E.g. Java protobuf 2.4 vs 2.5. Note that the major version is the same but they are still incompatible in a subtle way.\r\n\r\nIf the goal of this proposal is to create a document describing best practices for versioning then it should cover topics that I raised including backward compatibility. A document describing best practices for versioning, releasing, using vcs, maintain backward compatibility, etc would be very useful.\r\n\r\nIf the goal of this proposal is to make semver versions standard in the Go community then I think:\r\n- tools support should come first.  gofmt mentioned in the proposal is the excellent example why\r\n- it is fairly easy to enforce the version format but it is much more difficult or even impossible to make people follow the rules behind it\r\n",
