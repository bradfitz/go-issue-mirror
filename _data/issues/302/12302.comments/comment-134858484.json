I understand your frustration that this does all appear to be hypothetical at the moment.\r\n\r\nMy rational for starting as small as possible is (and I think well founded) that a proposal that introduced semver _and_ required everyone to tag their repos _and_ had to make a change to go get _and_ had to fit into the overfull 1.6 release cycle would be viewed with blank stares.\r\n\r\nThis is the smallest possible thing that I think can make the dependency management situation for Go programmers better. I think it is a reasonable thing that improves the life of Go developers and the ecosystem downstream from them even if the go tool does not grow to embrace it, as there are several dozen other competing Go dependency management tools in the market. \r\n\r\nWith that said, here are a few concrete areas that would benefit immediately\r\n\r\n- Debian and other operating systems can use this information today.\r\n- I plan to rev the manifest format that gb-vendor uses to include the tag information so I can offer my users a _real_ upgrade command, not just one that grabs the latest head of the branch they are on.\r\n- godoc.org can show users the docs for the version of the package they are using, not just show the latest that was in the upstream repo.",
