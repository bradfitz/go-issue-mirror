We want to approve the schema, based on prior art and reasoned analysis, and then address the tooling.\r\n\r\nSo,\r\n\r\n\u003e . . . And it feels like that's what's happening here.\r\n\r\nYou're right. But it's by design. Lack of standards around versioning is a problem _now_, and waiting for tooling to be born (and evolve, and mature, and de-facto standardize) around the schema would impose unacceptable delays. The Go universe is considerably bigger than in the nascent days of GOPATH, and more difficult to steer. We may not have the luxury of this kind of emergent design, especially for core concerns like versioning.\r\n\r\nAt least, this ☝︎ is the reasoning. It is not unassailable. Especially in light of e.g. @rsc's recent keynote, it may be too aggressive. But it would be a shame (to put it lightly) to delay a proper Go versioning story to 1.7 or beyond. Again, I defer to @davecheney, and hope I haven't misrepresented anything.",
