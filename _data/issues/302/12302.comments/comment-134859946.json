I assume I am not alone.\n\nNo \"frustration\" here, other than wanting to help get a resounding \"YES\" to\nsomething like this.\n\nOn Tue, Aug 25, 2015 at 11:36 PM, Dave Cheney \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e @thockin \u003chttps://github.com/thockin\u003e thanks for your comments. I\n\u003e understand your frustration that this does all appear to be hypothetical at\n\u003e the moment.\n\u003e\n\u003e My rational for starting as small as possible is (and I think well\n\u003e founded) that a proposal that introduced semver *and* required everyone\n\u003e to tag their repos *and* had to make a change to go get *and* had to fit\n\u003e into the overfull 1.6 release cycle would be viewed with blank stares.\n\u003e\n\u003e This is the smallest possible thing that I think can make the dependency\n\u003e management situation for Go programmers better. I think it is a reasonable\n\u003e thing that improves the life of Go developers and the ecosystem downstream\n\u003e from them even if the go tool does not grow to embrace it, as there are\n\u003e several dozen other competing Go dependency management tools in the market.\n\u003e\n\u003e With that said, here are a few concrete areas that would benefit\n\u003e immediately\n\u003e\n\u003e    - Debian and other operating systems could use this information today.\n\u003e    - I plan to rev the manifest format that gb-vendor uses to include the\n\u003e    tag information so I can offer my users a *real* upgrade command, not\n\u003e    just one that grabs the latest head of the branch they are on.\n\u003e    - godoc.org can show users the docs for the version of the package\n\u003e    they are using, not just show the latest that was in the upstream repo.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/12302#issuecomment-134858484\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
