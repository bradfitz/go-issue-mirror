This means:\r\n\r\n- any VCS tag should be usable by tools. Tag names and versions are given by humans for humans. Tools shouldn't care about them. If I want to use an api checker tool to compare tags `2015.03` and `2016.04` or two revisions `r1` and `r2` I should be able to do it. A good tool will allow me to use a packaged tagged `webdav-v1.final` as a dependency of my project and won't require any specific tag format.\r\n- ordering of versions could be useful sometimes. SemVer defines version order and it is a good starting point but it should be up to tool authors to implement a heuristic algorithm to compare versions (similar to [maven](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.3.3/maven-artifact/apidocs/org/apache/maven/artifact/versioning/ComparableVersion.html)) that is flexible enough to support SemVer and other version schemes\r\n",
