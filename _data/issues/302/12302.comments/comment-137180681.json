If a proposal is adopted, it's the recommendation of the Go community. It seems to me before codifying something, it should be well understood.\r\n\r\nCan anyone point to any code that uses this version scheme, maybe as part of a vendoring tool? How about a site for tracking projects currently using versioning? At the very least I would like to see something, some code, some projects, using this before it becomes the generally recommended way to do versioning. (I believe the relevant proverb is \"the proof of the pudding is in the eating\".)\r\n\r\nIdeally there will be enough use that someone like me who is hesitant about the notion of project can be convinced just by looking at goprojects.org, or whatever scaper site is built to track them.",
