	"body": "We released [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) 0.7.0 with SemVer support. I'll be curious to see how this is received. Released a [SemVer](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver) package for anyone else that wants to do this, too.\r\n\r\nThe other major feature that goes hand in hand with versions is flattening the dependency tree. There are ways storing packages in your own repo can cause problems. [I wrote up an example to illustrate it](https://github.com/mattfarina/golang-broken-vendor).\r\n\r\nI [wrote up the thinking around this](http://engineeredweb.com/blog/2015/glide-0.7.0-released/) for anyone wondering. It's inspired by package management for other languages and practical problems we've encountered working with Go.",
