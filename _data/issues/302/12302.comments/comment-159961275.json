I would ask, what would you envision this look\n\u003e like in go? What would a workflow look like? What would the tool do with\n\u003e semver?\n\u003e\n\nI took some time to read carefully the proposal and all the comments, and I\ncome up with an alternate specification:\nhttps://gist.github.com/perillo/06fe1d3e86f9cbf79b28\n\nThe main difference is that my specification proposes both how to attach a\nversion to a package inside its source control repository, and how to\nrequest a specified version of a package using go get.  The specification\nalso proposes some changes to `go get` documentation, how a remote `import\npath` must be handled, and to the `go version` and `go tool api` commands.\nAll changes do not break compatibility.\n\nAnother difference is that my specification also allows *partial*\nversions.  This is a very important question.\n\nFinally, my specification try to be compatible with current practice.\n\n\nThanks  Manlio\n",
