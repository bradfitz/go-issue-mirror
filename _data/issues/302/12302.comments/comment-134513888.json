I would expect the same outcome both for this proposal and vendor-spec.\r\n\r\nI am sorry, this was my misunderstanding, I'm still getting used to the proposal process.\r\n\r\nI agree that the website, maybe in one of the 'how to write Go code' pages would be a good place for this information, or possibly on the wiki. For me, the location is not as important as establishing a single recommended way to tag a Go project in their repos.\r\n\r\n\u003e I understand how this is distinct from vendor-spec. My question about vendor-spec was asking if this were basically \"version-spec\". \r\n\r\nI'm sorry for misunderstanding. I guess this is a version-spec if you want to think of it that way. \r\n\r\nI should add that in this initial proposal I have err'd on the side of brevity to focus on the outcomes, not the procedure. I fully expect that should this proposal move forward, the next step would be a [design document as you outlined in the proposal process](https://github.com/golang/proposal). \r\n\r\n\u003e I think that vendor-spec might be influenced by this proposal, though.\r\n\r\nPossibly a bit, but I don't think either proposal should be dependant on one another. The former, this one, is about a format for a release tag on repositories, while the vendor-spec caters for tags, branches, and revisions equally, and it is hard to see this proposal designing a tag format that is impossible to express in the vendor-spec.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDave",
