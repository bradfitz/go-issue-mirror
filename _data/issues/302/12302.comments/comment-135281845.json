	"body": "@kostya-sh This proposal would not allow effective versioning of the golang.org/x packages because those repositories contain packages that will version at vastly different rates. This proposal explicitly defines the unit of version to equal the repository. For instance `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` will version differently then `golang.org/crypto/md4`, or `golang.org/x/net/context` will version much more slowly then `golang.org/x/net/websocket`.\r\n\r\nIn previously conversations regarding this proposal it was commented that the golang.org/x repos were really too large/mixed and should be more granular ideally.\r\n",
