The proposal guidelines clearly state \"a lack of agreement means [the proposal is] declined\", as such it is appropriate that I withdraw this proposal.\r\n\r\nI want to extend my sincere thanks to all who have contributed to this debate. I remain passionate about improving the tools Go programmers have to manage package dependencies in large Go projects and your feedback has been invaluable to me and my future efforts.\r\n\r\nThank you again\r\n\r\nDave ",
