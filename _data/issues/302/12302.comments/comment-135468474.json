Here we go.\r\n\r\nI am +1\r\nGolang versioning has been a point of contention in fedora packaging guidelines for golang as well.\r\n\r\nSome thoughts. In keeping with semver, and helping to approach the \"latest\" question, the tagging deduction ought to define greatest in the current point provided. Example `go get -version v2 ...` pull the explicit tag `v2` or `v2.y[.z]` if present, `go get -version v2.1 ...` would match `v2.1` or `v2.1.z` if present, and so on. This is was a hold-back on gopkg.in for some.\r\n\r\nAlso, this semantic would only be on `go get`, not `build`, `install`? I don't see this being a layout consideration for `./pkg`, only processing on the cvs fetched. A later call like `go get -u -v3 ...` would fetch and checkout the matched or greatest semver tag, right?",
