I think it is important to get the Go open source library-developing community to migrate towards a more formal versioning standard.\r\n\r\n+1 to retaining the 'v' prefix to the version strings. Keep it simple.\r\n\r\nHow would you propose that we reconcile the SemVer rule stating \"MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes\" with the generally accepted Go community practice that \"Incompatible API changes should require a new import path.\" (me, paraphrasing Rob probably)?\r\n\r\nSuggest modifying \"Authors of Go projects who wish to release of their projects must tag their software using a tag in the form described above.\" to something less restrictive. If a library provider doesn't want to participate in the ecosystem that will be built around this standard, we won't be too upset, right? :-)",
