	"body": "@nathany If I understand what @rsc is say the issue is that adding SemVer as a recommendation without having part of the `go` toolchain using it is the issue. I'm not sure we'd find agreement on the right way to use SemVer in the toolchain right now. I think we really want SemVer so we can start to use it in tools and figure out directions it can be useful. So we can leverage versions like other communities.\r\n\r\nIf community things that aren't going to be built directly into the tools aren't appropriate for this forum do we need something similar to the [PHP FIG](http://www.php-fig.org) for the community?
