Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. duck1.go at \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/b3fgRS8fwj\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/b3fgRS8fwj\u003c/a\u003e\n2. duck2.go at \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/bgZ5wM0wvw\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/bgZ5wM0wvw\u003c/a\u003e \n\nWhat is the expected output?\nduck1.go works as intended. i sort of expected that duck2.go would work fine too, since\nthe anonymous struct i created would be used just like the declared interface, so\naccording to duck-typing philosophy why can't it compile? i know the difference between\nfields and methods comes into play too, but why should we care since operationally it'd\nbe used same way?\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nprog.go:19: struct { Howdy func(int) string }.Howdy is a field, not a method\nprog.go:19: cannot use struct { Howdy func(int) string } literal (type struct { Howdy\nfunc(int) string }) as type Test in assignment:\n\tstruct { Howdy func(int) string } does not implement Test (missing Howdy method)\n [process exited with non-zero status]\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\u0026quot;go run duck1.go\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;go run duck2.go\u0026quot;\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nlinux mint 15\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version devel +f795546f1c55 Sat Aug 31 22:02:21 2013 +1000 linux/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nthis is probably more a feature request than a bug, sorry.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/6302/0/duck1.go\"\u003educk1.go\u003c/a\u003e (291 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/6302/0/duck2.go\"\u003educk2.go\u003c/a\u003e (356 bytes)",
