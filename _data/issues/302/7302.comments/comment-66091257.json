It removes what go install would create, not everything\nevery possible go install would create. It doesn't remove things for other architectures\nor operating systems and should also not remove things for other compilers.\n\nHowever, clean should accept -compiler so that you can remove what go install -compiler\ninstalls.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-none**, removed **release-go1.3**._",
