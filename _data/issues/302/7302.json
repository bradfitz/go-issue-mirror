	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Install a library using gccgo as the compiler, e.g. go install -compiler gccgo\nlaunchpad.net/gnuflag\n2. Run go clean -i launchpad.net/gnuflag\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n$GOPATH/pkg/gccgo_$GOOS_$GOARCH/launchpad.net/libgnuflag.a should have been deleted.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n$GOPATH/pkg/gccgo_$GOOS_$GOARCH/launchpad.net/libgnuflag.a has not been deleted.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\ngccgo\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nUbuntu Trusty\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo version devel +7abe32ccffb1 Wed Jan 22 15:55:56 2014 -0800 linux/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nIf you build the go tool with gccgo, go clean does remove the artefact so it's possible\nthat instead of go clean removing gccgo built things by default, go clean should take a\n-compiler gccgo flag like build, install etc to know where to look.\u003c/pre\u003e",
