However I haven't been able to test my theoretical fixes.\n\nThe problem is that it appears the build process updates the working copy to the\nrelease-branch.go1.2 branch right before the installer build process starts, which means\nit's not using the fixed installer.wxs version on the release-branch.go1.3 branch.\n\nI'm still investigating why this is happening, but if I'm missing something obvious\nplease let me know.\u003c/pre\u003e",
