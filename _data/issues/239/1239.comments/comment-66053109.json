For example, web.go uses things in $GOROOT/src/ like:\n\n$GOROOT/src/Make.inc\n$GOROOT/src/Make.pkg\netc...\n\nIMHO and according to FHS:\n\nThe src dir should be in /usr/share/go or /usr/src/go maybe.\nThe libs should be at /usr/lib64/go\nThe docs and examples in /usr/share/doc/go\n\nSo, as far as I can see, I need a $GOSRC and, possibly, a $GODOCS vars.\n\nI'm, currently (as you know), trying to package go for Fedora:\n\u003ca href=\"http://renich.fedorapeople.org/SPECS/go.spec\"\u003ehttp://renich.fedorapeople.org/SPECS/go.spec\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
