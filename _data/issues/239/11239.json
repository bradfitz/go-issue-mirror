	"body": "Since [CL 10981](http://golang.org/cl/10981), the Plan 9 builders are failing on :\r\n\r\n```\r\nInstalled Go for plan9/386 in /tmp/workdir/go\r\nInstalled commands in /tmp/workdir/go/bin\r\n*** You need to bind /tmp/workdir/go/bin before /bin.\r\nFailed to schedule \"go_test:archive/tar\" test after 3 tries.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt happens because the health check executed by the coordinator are failing.\r\nBrad thinks the Plan 9 buildlet couldn't execute the tests in a child process\r\nand reply to a health check at the same time.\r\n\r\nBrad submitted [CL 11132](http://golang.org/cl/11132) to work around this issue.\r\nIt seems that no more than two health checks could fail consecutively.\r\n",
