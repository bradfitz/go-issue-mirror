And, going by your description, it is happening in Stat in exec_posix.go:26 in os package. Perhaps you can insert some prints to see if we can reproduce it somehow. We need that for new test.\r\n\r\nI suspect it fails when GetFileAttributesEx is called on some directory.\r\n\r\nI tried making GetFileAttributesEx fail with files. GetFileAttributesEx works even if I open file exclusively (dwShareMode set to 0 of CreateFile) in a different process. GetFileAttributesEx works also if I LockFileEx with dwFlags set to LOCKFILE_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK in a different process. Opening file fails with ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION, but GetFileAttributesEx works.\r\n\r\nI can only make GetFileAttributesEx fail with ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION for c:\\pagefil.sys on my pc. I created https://go-review.googlesource.com/22796 that fixes Stat(`c:\\pagefil.sys`) on my computer. Perhaps CL fixes your problem too. Please try it and let me know.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nAlex",
