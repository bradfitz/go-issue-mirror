	"title": "crypto/x509: better documentation for ParsePKIXPublicKey",
	"body": "In the latest Golang release (1.5.3), the documentation for x509.ParsePKIXPublicKey() says the function takes in a `[]byte` of DER encoded public key and returns `pub interface{}`. It is not obvious exactly what `pub` is or how to use it unless digging inside the source code and trace to the function `parsePublicKey()`.\r\n\r\nSuggested changes:\r\n* Mention explicitly what kind of public key input we support (RSA, DSA, ECDSA)\r\n* Mention the type of `pub` in those three cases respectively\r\n* Add a short example on how to use `switch` statement along with type assertions to obtain the correct type of public key. \r\n\r\nI will be happy to make those improvements to the document and submit for code review if no objections from the project maintainers.",
