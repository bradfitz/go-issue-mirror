The language spec was even adjusted to accommodate for that (e.g. CRs are stripped from raw strings https://golang.org/ref/spec#String_literals).\r\n\r\nWe also know that a huge number of Go developers work on Windows (the majority?), so I'd like to hear what other Windows users have to say here. Specifically, is the fact that gofmt strips CRs from .go files a problem when interacting with whatever version control system is used?\r\n\r\nMy inclination is that the right approach here might be for an organization that works exclusively in a CR/LF environment to make their own customized gofmt. It's trivial to to that (the cmd/gofmt command essentially uses the go/format package which produces a string containing the formatted source. It's a simple loop to introduce CR\\LFs as necessary.)\r\n",
