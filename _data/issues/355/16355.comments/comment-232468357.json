Line endings will be checked out based on the local system and expected to be in the local system format - possibly converting to a common format internally.  Variations abound in how this is handled by Git, Perforce, etc.  So having a file checked in as CR/LF and gofmt changing it to LF *is* a problem.  It is changing the file in a way that can cause checkin problems.\r\nAgain, the standard Windows EOL terminator is \\r\\n - and gofmt should honor that when present.  \r\n",
