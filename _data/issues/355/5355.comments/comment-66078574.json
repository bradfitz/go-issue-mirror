One supplies local address when\ncreating socket, while other supplies nil. That goes to different code path, one calls\nsyscall.Bind explicitly, while the other expect connect to do all the binding. Windows\nsyscall.ConnextEx needs syscall.Bind to be called explicitly.\n\nI will add test with net.Dialer. That should cover us.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
