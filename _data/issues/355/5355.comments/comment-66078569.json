All our outgoing sockets are unbound, so I\nput Bind right before I do ConnectEx. That is, until I discovered net.Dialer, which\nbinds its socket. I am not sure what is correct approach is - where should the\nsyscall.Bind be called from. So, if you would suggest a good plan, I will make changes.\nAlternatively, please, send change yourself, if you like. Thank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
