	"body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem that net/http's http.Transport supports HSTS (HTTP Strict-Transport-Security, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797). Is it something we could add?\r\n\r\nInitially, I'm thinking just the http-\u003ehttps upgrade bit and not certificate pins. Also, just dynamic mode and not static configuration like Chromium has.\r\nThat is: if we receive an HSTS header we remember it in the current http.Transport and upgrade any future http request to https, but terminating the program means we forget about it.",
