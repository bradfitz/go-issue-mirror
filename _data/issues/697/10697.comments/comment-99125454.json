	"body": "This doesn't seem relevant to the `net/http` package because we don't receive raw user strings like `foo.com` in an Omnibar from Chrome or Firefox. We work in terms of complete URLs, so it's up to the calling application to do HSTS if they want.\r\n\r\nPlus, any HSTS state should usually persist longer than the lifetime of a given Go process, so it necessarily involves writing state somewhere, which is outside the scope of the `net/http` package.\r\n\r\nTentatively closing this bug, unless I'm convinced otherwise.\r\n\r\n/cc @agl for opinions, if any.",
