I wonder if a viable alternative would be to have it instead:\r\n\r\n- Compare:\r\n  - The _import path comment_ `// import \"rsc.io/pdf\"`\r\n  - Against the package directory inside $GOPATH `$GOPATH/src/rsc.io/pdf`\r\n\r\nThis would still have it block people from doing `go get github.com/rsc/pdf` -- as that would place it inside `$GOPATH/src/github.com/rsc/pdf` (not the same as the import comment).\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about this to know if this is a good solution, or why testing against the git repo's remote URL was chosen (assuming I am correct on this).",
