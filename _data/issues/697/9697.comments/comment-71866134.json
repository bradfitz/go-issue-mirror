It's extremely surprising to me that this invariant has been broken in 1.4.\r\n\r\nAre you saying that you can run \"go get importpath\" and then \"go get -u importpath\" and receive that error message? That shouldn't happen. I don't understand how it _could_ happen. Or are you saying that if you run the first command with a pre-Go 1.4 go tool, and the latter with the Go 1.4 go tool, you receive the error?\r\n\r\n@nightlyone that seems like a reasonable fix. What say you @rsc?",
