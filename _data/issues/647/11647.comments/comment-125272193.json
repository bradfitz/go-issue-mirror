	"body": "I'm in favor of splitting up the runtime, at least insofar as it is mostly just movement of existing code. This has the following advantages:\r\n\r\n* Makes the structure and components of the runtime more obvious. There really are several basically standalone pieces.\r\n* Faster to run runtime tests when making modifications. (This is a pain point; the runtime tests are slow.)\r\n* Easier to do safe refactoring and experimentation.\r\n* Having a runtime/internal/magic package will make it more obvious where the runtime touches the compiler.\r\n\r\n",
