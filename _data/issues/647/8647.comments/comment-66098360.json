I don't\nreally know how to setup and test the builder, but this docker image at least lets you\nssh in so it can be used as a starting point. \n\nI worry that the debian apt-get install gcc might stop working if it gets out of date\nand the aurel32 person hasn't updated the images in a while, it might be worth hosting\nour own image with everything needed preinstalled.\n\nI also created a vagrant file and some scripts following\n\u003ca href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Dev/QemuARMVexpress\"\u003ehttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Dev/QemuARMVexpress\u003c/a\u003e which can generate a dual core ubuntu\narm image:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/andrewchambers/arm-vexpress-dualcore-image\"\u003ehttps://github.com/andrewchambers/arm-vexpress-dualcore-image\u003c/a\u003e\n\nUnfortunately it seems really unstable, and randomly fails to boot/hangs with kernel\nerrors.\u003c/pre\u003e",
