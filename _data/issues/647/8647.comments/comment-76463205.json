But I also thought QEMU only let you have 1GB of memory available for the emulated ARM machine. \r\n\r\nI see in Salman's CL:\r\n\r\n\u003e /usr/bin/qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -cpu cortex-a9 -nographic -no-reboot -sd /arm/root.img -kernel /arm/vmlinuz -append \"root=/dev/mmcblk0 console=ttyAMA0 rw rootwait\" -m 512 -redir tcp:80::80 -redir tcp:443::443 -redir tcp:5936::5936\r\n\r\n... which is only 512 MB.\r\n\r\nBut https://wiki.linaro.org/PeterMaydell/QemuVersatileExpress shows using that board with 1024 at least.\r\n\r\nCan we go higher than 1024 even? http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM/Versatile_Express suggests 1GB might be the limit.\r\n\r\nSalman, why did you make it 512 MB?  And why did you have more success with the builds than me?  Maybe you were only building Go 1.4.2 and the builders are running tip, which takes more memory?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
