This is different\nfrom a (legacy) builder which only runs builds for its specific build key.\n\nIf this is right then adding a pool of ARM capable machines should be\nsimilar, but with the added benefit that we also get docker containers.\n\nMy personal opinion is qemu-arm is more trouble than it's worth, compared\nto a pool of real arm hardware which will give us coverage for nacl/arm and\nlinux/arm.\n\nFreebsd/arm is something I'd like to revive, I hope before the close of\n1.5, but that will probably remain with a legacy builder for the moment.\n\nOn Fri, Feb 13, 2015 at 11:06 AM, Brad Fitzpatrick \u003cnotifications@github.com\n\u003e wrote:\n\n\u003e Also, @davecheney \u003chttps://github.com/davecheney\u003e, maybe you could\n\u003e provide input or help on this stuff.
