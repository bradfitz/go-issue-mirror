During the\n~60 seconds before the index (partial or full-text) is built, the godoc server takes\nonly 6-7mb and everything but search seems fully functional.\n\nThat pre-index state is about 99.5% as useful to me as post-index, even though it takes\nonly 3-4% as much memory. In my experience, when I'm looking for something that belongs\nin the standard library, commands, or spec, the location is very logical and I know\nwhere to look without a search box. If I'm looking for something else, it's not in the\ndocumentation anyway, so searching there won't help me.\n\nIn sum, a simple \"-disablesearch\" flag would be a great enhancement to godoc for those\nof us who just want a lightweight documentation server without search.\u003c/pre\u003e",
