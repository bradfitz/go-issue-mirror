It\nspecifies how many seconds to wait before indexing. If set to 0, indexing is disabled\nentirely, along with search. It defaults to 60 seconds, so existing godoc invocation is\nunchanged.\n\nThe diff is attached. I'm also working through the steps at\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/contribute.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/contribute.html\u003c/a\u003e, though from a different email address. Hopefully\nthis patch is an acceptable way to keep things working as intended while allowing users\nthe choice to disable memory-hungry search if they wish.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1647/7/godoc.diff\"\u003egodoc.diff\u003c/a\u003e (713 bytes)",
