Setting the Setctty option always produces an error and\ncauses the fork to fail.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Run either of the attached examples\n2. Note errors\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nI expect the fork to succeed and the child process to have it's controlling terminal set\nto the same terminal as where the program was run (maintain foreground in bash after the\nparent exits)\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nfork fails with errors\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nMac OS X, Linux\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\ncb41d013cf7f tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThis option probably won't ever work with the design of the os/exec package since it\nswaps out the original fd's with pipes (which should probably be noted in the\ndocumentation for that package).  It should be able to be used with the syscall.ForkExec.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2647/0/exec_you_ctty.go\"\u003eexec_you_ctty.go\u003c/a\u003e (365 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2647/0/fork_you_ctty.go\"\u003efork_you_ctty.go\u003c/a\u003e (332 bytes)",
