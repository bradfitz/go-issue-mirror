I sent out [CL/17913](https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/17913/).\r\n\r\nAlso, I only fixed header-only issues on the Reader side since a bug was filed for it (b/25418768). But the Writer still allows users to generate invalid tar files (by putting data in a header-only \"file\"). I have a fix for it, but was planning to address it next cycle. Since the Reader and Writer are now asymmetrical in this regard, should I submit a CL for fixing header-only files for Writer for go1.6?",
