	"body": "I do not think we should the existing `Truncate` function.  I think it behaves meaningfully and as documented, though of course I'm fine with clarifying the docs.  I wouldn't say it does not work with `time.Hour`, I would stress that it works on absolute time.  And dropping or changing the example is fine with me.\r\n\r\nIf we add a new function, what would that function do?  How would we document it?  It's not clear that we need a variant of `time.Truncate`, a function that is frankly difficult to think about for any value other than `time.Hour`, `time.Day`, or some other well known value.  What is the use case we are trying to implement?",
