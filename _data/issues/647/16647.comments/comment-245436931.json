That is, zero out the fractional seconds, or zero out the seconds, or zero out the minutes, or the hour, etc. In this particular case it came up because I want to bucket times in a way that I can then use a format string that omits the more detailed fields. For example, if I call 12:45 AM -\u003e Truncate(Hour), I get back 12:30 AM (in some time zones). If I then go on to format that as 12 AM, that's very misleading, because it's actually the 12:30 AM - 1:30 AM bucket, not the 12 AM - 1 AM bucket.\r\n\r\nAs I pointed out with my playground link, it's not as simple as calling time.Date with some of the fields set to zero.",
