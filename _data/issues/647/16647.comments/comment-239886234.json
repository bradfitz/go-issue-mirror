Thus, we do have to care about which presentation time to show. Every time you call time.Date, in fact, you're round-tripping through presentation time (as your playground example does).\r\n\r\nSo while I would like Go to provide a time.Truncate that works usefully in presentation time, the one we have doesn't, and the documentation should explain that.",
