	"body": "@leighmcculloch, the problem is caused by the `import \".\"` in your xtest versions. The go command should really disallow that. The convention for an xtest is to change\n\n\tpackage static\n\t\nto\n\n\tpackage static_test\n\t\n\timport . \"github.com/leighmcculloch/static\"\n\nand then you don't need to change anything else (in particular you don't have to put a \"static.\" prefix on every identifier). That produces the right coverage percentages.\n\nIf instead I do\n\n\tpackage static_test\n\t\n\timport . \".\"\n\nthen I get the result you describe, where the coverage percentage does not include all the lines in the test.\n\nI can't remember where the issue is about disallowing import of \".\", but this may be an argument one way or the other in that issue.\n\n@robpike, no need to work on this.",
