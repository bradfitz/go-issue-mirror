	"body": "by **jikai507**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eFor example, see the code:\n\n    package main\n\n    import \u0026quot;os\u0026quot;\n\n    func main() {\n        file, err := os.Open(\u0026quot;test.txt\u0026quot;);\n        defer file.Close()\n        if err != nil {\n            return\n        }\n    }\n\nThe code like this may crash when running...Because if file \u0026quot;test.txt\u0026quot; doesn't\nexist, the file will be nil. But just now I test it again but now the program can run\nwithout crash.\n\nI want to ask that is defer support the nil object now??? now my go version is 1.2.1 \n\nI want to eliminate this problem, but I don't sure the keyword defer has been modified\nby go group.\u003c/pre\u003e",
