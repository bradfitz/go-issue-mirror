	"body": "see https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/7/21/759\r\n\r\nwe probably need to switch to use set_thread_area(2) instead for linux/386.\r\n(do we need to apply this Go 1.4.4 so that Go 1.4 continues to run on\r\nnewer kernels with disabled modify_ldt? tentatively labeled Go1.4.4)\r\n\r\nAccording to arch_prctl(2) man page: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/arch_prctl.2.html\r\n       Context switches for 64-bit segment bases are rather expensive.  As\r\n       an optimization, if a 32-bit TLS base address is used, arch_prctl(2)\r\n       may use a real TLS entry as if set_thread_area(2) had been called,\r\n       instead of manipulating the segment base register directly.\r\n\r\nso we probably could switch to set_thread_area even on linux/amd64,\r\nbut I see that glibc still uses arch_prctl(ARCH_SET_FS), so probably\r\nthe overhead is not that big a problem.",
