Or do you want us to provide the intrinsics (which ones?) which you will need to do so yourself?\r\n\r\nAre \u003e= SSE3+ but \u003c AES-NI chips worth targeting?\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, all the ops the paper uses (which isn't entirely clear - it would be really nice if they had assembly listings) are available now in Go assembly.\r\n",
