	"body": "Same questions as Austin. The line in question says x.(T), and it looks like x came from near the beginning of an allocated struct (specifically, starting at the second word of the struct). That allocated struct containing the interface value x was prematurely collected by the garbage collector. The question is why. How long has the containing struct existed? Where do the references to it live? How often are those places updated? Any information like that would help.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
