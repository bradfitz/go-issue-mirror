	"body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI am not entirely sure if this is a feature or a bug. Under some conditions, it's possible that the Go compiler does not complain about unhandled errors.\r\n\r\nAn example can be found here:\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/lTO9l-Ivb_\r\n\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\n\tcontent, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)\r\n\t//No warning although err is not handled\r\n\tif err := json.Unmarshal(content, foo); err != nil {\r\n\t\t...\r\n\t}\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e\r\n\r\nIt seems to be caused by the short version of the if-err-condition/assignment. The question is, whether this is a bug, or a feature. In case it is a bug, how hard is it to fix it?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSimon",
