But then we need to find different solution to issue #16368.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we can hard code golang.org/sys/windows (and some others) in gddo to display these as windows packages. But this is very error prone. And what about other similar packages?\r\n\r\nMaybe we could come up with some new gddo rule for that. Compare different GOOS / GOARCH versions of the package - number of global variables, functions, types and so on - and show version with most of these.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nAlex",
