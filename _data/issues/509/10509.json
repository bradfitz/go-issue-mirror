	"body": "The code at the bottom of isStale that bypasses the source file mtime checks was added to fix a bug (issue #3149) about writing to a system GOROOT, but the fix also (intentionally) separated out different GOPATH entries. This causes problems when people use fine-grained GOPATHs (not the common case, but also not something that should be broken), because installing a binary or package in one GOPATH uses stale packages from the other.\n\nThe system GOROOT has been the subject of many follow-on bugs and is now handled separately. We should remove the GOPATH barrier.",
