I think this is another\nsend + received missed each other, except that there's a select doing\none or the other op so we can't see the channel pointers on the stack trace.\n\nThe real question is why the locks are not providing mutual exclusion.\nEither the lock implementation is broken in such a way that it only\nfails on ARM, or the Linux CAS implementation (which we jump to at ffff0fc0)\nis broken on your kernel (I looked at LXR's copy of that kernel\nwithout the -Netgear\nand it seemed okay).  That's all I can think of.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
