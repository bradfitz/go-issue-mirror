I'd just like to figure out how to work\nwith the Linux kernel implementation if at all possible, because it means\nwe don't have to build binaries targeted to specific processors.\n\nThank you!  I see the problem.  We are relying on the compare-and-swap\ndoing a real compare-and-swap but in fact this implementation can return\na false negative.  This is fixed in later versions of the kernel (2.6.24+) after\nthis change:\n\u003ca href=\"http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git\"\u003ehttp://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git\u003c/a\u003e;a=commit;h=b49c0f24cf6744a3f4fd09289fe7cade349dead5\n\nAs that change description says, most uses are in a loop so it doesn't matter.\nBut there is one - in chan.c - that depends on the compare and swap\nnever returning a false negative.\n\nPlease try 4436072.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
