I don't want to\nhave to select different assembly for each chip during\nthe build process.  That's the whole reason the kernel\nleaves an implementation at ffff0fc0.  On ARM 5 the\nkernel is supposed to treat the cas implementation as\na restartable atomic sequence: if a process gets interrupted\nin the middle of the sequence the kernel restarts it at\nthe beginning, so that the read+compare+write is\nguaranteed not to have been interrupted and therefore\nran (effectively) atomically.\n\nWe must be doing something different compared to\nthe C library that is making the kernel not restart the\nsequence properly.  Do you know where the restarting\ncode is?\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
