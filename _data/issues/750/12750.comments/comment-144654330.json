	"body": "As far as plurals are concerned, I've seen some elaborate examples, but what somewhat skimming the doc, it seems they can use only \"\u003c\", \"\u003e\", and \"=\" operators; I didn't read it 100% thoroughly however, so I may be wrong. I'll thus let myself ask here for clarifications: are the proposed mechanisms enough to cater for the rule for e.g. Polish language? In a version I found on Weblate site, it's described as [[1]](https://demo.weblate.org/translate/hello/master/pl/?checksum=33edc1b4564afa3f7171bb8ffa9c34b6) [[2]](https://docs.weblate.org/en/weblate-2.4/user/translating.html#plurals):\r\n```\r\nn==1 ? 0 :                                              // \"single\"\r\n n%10\u003e=2 \u0026\u0026 n%10\u003c=4 \u0026\u0026 (n%100\u003c10 || n%100\u003e=20) ? 1 :    // \"few\"\r\n 2                                                      // \"many\"\r\n```\r\nwhich seems to me quite fine, correctly giving e.g.:\r\n```\r\n1 orangutan\r\n2-4 orangutany\r\n5-9 orangutanów\r\n10, 11, 12, ..., 21 orangutanów\r\n22 orangutany\r\n101 orangutanów\r\n102 orangutany\r\netc.\r\n```",
