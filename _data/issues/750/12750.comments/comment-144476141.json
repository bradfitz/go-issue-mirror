I can imagine a very simple Printf used like `m.Printf(\"%s: %d\", m, i)` where the format string `%s: %d` could appear a dozen times throughout a codebase with very different contexts. (You could argue that this is a very poor format string to begin with, but it still demonstrates my concern.)\r\n\r\nI must admit I'm not very familiar with localization problems and this may not be an issue in practice.",
