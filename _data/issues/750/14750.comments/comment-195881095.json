	"body": "UseStrictNames does look like a decent way to add case-sensitive decoding support in a backward compatible way.\r\n\r\nHowever, while that would make case-sensitive decodes possible, it wouldn't help make this safer mode common or the default.\r\n\r\nHow about also defining a \"strict\" field tag option (c.f. \"omitempty\")? That should allow types to be safely used via newDecoder, or Unmarshall, or when the decoding is within a library. You can define the safety in the type, without finding every place it might be decoded.",
