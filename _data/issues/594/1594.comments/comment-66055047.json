Example of problems to be\nsolved would be handling questions like \"was this change made yesterday\" or \"was this\nchange made in the last three weeks\" or \"was this change made last February\".\n\nThis sort of code tends to be tricky to write (e.g. is it yesterday in my time zone?),\nand a well-defined thoughtful API would be helpful.  I'm not sure what this API would\nlook like, but it's worth keeping in mind when one thinks about rewriting time.\n\nExamples of programs that use this kind of functionality would be git and darcs (and\nmaybe hg?), but it can also show up on all sorts of web searching (e.g. a bank's\ntransaction history display).\n\nIt might also be handy to also have a function that translated a human-language string\ninto a date string, but I'm not comfortable with English-specific functionality going\ninto the core language.\u003c/pre\u003e",
