For example:\nprintln(unsafe.Sizeof(3))\nOutput: -1000000000\n\nunsafe.Alignof on a numeric constant doesn't compile and produces:\n\u0026lt;epoch\u0026gt;: internal compiler error: dowidth: unknown type: ideal\n\nFor comparison, unsafe.Sizeof and unsafe.Alignof on a string literal\nproduce 16 and 8, respectively.\n\nI think the expected behavior would be a reasonable compile error in both\ncases. It might also be acceptable to treat the numeric constant as\nwhatever type it would become in a short variable declaration. (That is, 12\nis an int, 2.5 is a float, 5i is a complex.)\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n$GOOS: linux\n$GOARCH: amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?
