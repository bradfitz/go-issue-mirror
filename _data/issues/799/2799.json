Could that {{.Version}}\nbe exposed to binaries in some way?\n\nA few documentation suggestions:\nFrom the one-line summary, 'build', 'get', and 'install' all sound nearly identical.  It\nwould be nice if the one-line summary helped distinguish between them better.  For\nexample do 'get' and 'install' not compile a program?  Build sounds like it installs a\ncommand or package (though the long help suggests otherwise).\n\nIt would be nice if the long 'go help build' were indented.  As it is, it's hard to see\nwhere in my terminal window that help text begins.\u003c/pre\u003e",
