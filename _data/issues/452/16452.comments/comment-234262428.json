	"body": "This is a tmpfs bug. But it seems like checking whether something is a dir and rmdir(ing) it instead of unlink is a good practice. There are a lot of filesystems out there, and POSIX spec clearly says that it is not necessarily supported everywhere. There is already work my team is doing to address this in Illumos, but it will still likely be a problem in Solaris, and in earlier versions which are still in active use, but are not really maintained, like OpenSolaris, and OpenIndiana.\r\n\r\nAs for sample program, I am assuming you would like that to be a playground link?\r\n\r\nThanks for considering this!",
