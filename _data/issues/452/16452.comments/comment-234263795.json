But it seems like checking whether something is a dir and rmdir(ing) it instead of unlink is a good practice. \r\n\r\nGlad we helped find a bug! :) From memory, this seems like about the 9th kernel bug Go has accidentally brought to light in various operating systems.\r\n\r\n\u003e As for sample program, I am assuming you would like that to be a playground link?\r\n\r\nOr a gist. Whatever you'd like. Something I can click and read online, even if it doesn't run.\r\n",
