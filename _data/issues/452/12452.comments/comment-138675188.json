If I re-ran the script today, Oracle would be included in the list based on your commits. The script works.\r\n\r\nBut @4ad, how would my A+C update script ever know that Oracle owned your copyright for commits coming from your personal email address?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why @rsc gave you that advice, or what the context was. I will work with @adg and @ianlancetaylor and others to update the docs to make this more clear.",
