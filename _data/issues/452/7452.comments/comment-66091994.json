A real disassembler\nneeds to be added in order to support the pprof disasm command\nand the per-line assembly displays in weblist. That's still to come.\n\nProbably objdump will move to go.tools when the disassembler\nis added, but it can stay here for now.\n\nLGTM=minux.ma\nR=golang-codereviews, minux.ma\nCC=golang-codereviews, iant, r\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/87580043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/87580043\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
