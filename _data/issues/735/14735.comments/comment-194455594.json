GOGC is expressed in terms of live heap during a GC, and you generally don't know when GC is triggered. With concurrent marking and sweeping, these things are blurred even more. Let's just pretend that GC has higher chances to be triggered at a more fortunate point.\r\n\r\n\u003e Don't we return unused pages to the OS (e.g. via MADV_DONTNEED) after a spike subsides?\r\n\r\nThis is a good point. I feel that both things are useful and need to coexist. I don't have a ready answer.\r\nMaybe it is OK as is, because memory is released to OS with a very low frequency. And if it was released we do want to try to keep RSS on that lower level.\r\nMaybe it is OK because the additional CPU cost is not that high.\r\nMaybe we can introduce even lower frequency metric to amortize the additional CPU cost.\r\n",
