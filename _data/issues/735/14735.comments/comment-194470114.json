(Or at least low-pass filter it when it's going up.)\r\n\r\nI'm curious for more details about v8's GC scheduling if you have them or have a pointer.\r\n\r\n\u003e Don't we return unused pages to the OS (e.g. via MADV_DONTNEED) after a spike subsides? To cap the amount of additional CPU we'd probably need to stop doing that (which I'd argue is fine, but I would expect to encounter many users who vehemently disagree).\r\n\r\nIf anything, we need to return memory to the OS more aggressively. In this case, returning it more aggressively will make a heap spike less costly in terms of RSS over time. But in general, there's no such thing as \"unused memory\". If it's not being used by an application, it's being used for something else like OS file caches or, on mobile, whole other applications. There's obviously a balance to be struck since we need to amortize the cost of returning memory to the OS and then potentially asking for it back. We don't want to return a page the instant we're not using it, but there is most certainly value in returning memory to the OS.",
