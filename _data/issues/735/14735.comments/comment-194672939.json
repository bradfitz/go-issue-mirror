	"body": "@dvyukov, what you are describing is the exact opposite of the problem I see most often when looking at GC overheads. What I see is programs like the compiler that tend to have long phases where they mostly allocate and don't give up much garbage from those allocations. In those phases, you'd ideally want the goal to be even higher, because the GC isn't going to reclaim much anyway. What you're describing would move the goal in the opposite direction, making it grow even more slowly and therefore making GC cost even more. That is, you are optimizing space at the cost of increased GC overhead. Often people want the opposite.\r\n\r\nI am not convinced we should change the goal calculation. There are clearly scenarios where it's too big and where it's too small, but at least it's understandable, and GOGC gives control in the cases where it absolutely needs changing.\r\n",
