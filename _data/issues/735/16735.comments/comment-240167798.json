	"body": "@keltia, the patch you link to is modifying the \"syscall\" package, which is frozen. We even document that at the top of the page (https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/), telling users to use https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix etc instead.\r\n\r\nThe Go runtime itself doesn't always use the \"syscall\" package.\r\n\r\nFor instance, for the interface data, we actually vendor a copy of https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/route instead (into the standard library, privately) which has been updated for various FreeBSD versions.\r\n\r\nWhat was the original problem which motivated the syscall patch? It looks like http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports-bugs/2015-August/315441.html but that was fixed in Go 1.7 by the x/net/route vendoring.\r\n\r\n/cc @mikioh \r\n",
