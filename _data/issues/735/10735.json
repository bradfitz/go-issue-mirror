The program couldn't properly detect EOF. Reference [code](https://play.golang.org/p/IayBVrVhiT).\r\n\r\n* What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nThe program should stop immediately I sent the EOF (ctrl+D).\r\n\r\n* What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nThe program hung there. Pressing ctrl+D multiple times did stop the program.",
