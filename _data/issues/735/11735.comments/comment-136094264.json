Alas my understanding of xml namespacing is the major issue, and as you noted stackoverflow does indeed seem like the correct place for it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18934327/golang-how-to-unmarshal-xml-attributes-with-colons\r\n\r\nI want to thank you though for taking the time to help me, I do appreciate it. Even for nitpicking is legit and I'll adjust my vars for the future :) Cheers",
