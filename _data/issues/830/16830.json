	"body": "Hello there,\r\n\r\nSince this :  https://github.com/golang/go/blob/d0e8d3a7ae2194b1753bc4e419d5f00aa2d5cb86/src/compress/gzip/gzip.go#L235\r\n\r\nFor a lot of libraries that use defer close to Close gzip in http handlers it's going to be impossible to call WriteHeader in the event of a panic, this a call to Write will default the headers to 200.\r\n\r\nFound it there : https://github.com/BakedSoftware/go-parameters/pull/6/files\r\n\r\nAnd there : https://github.com/NYTimes/gziphandler/issues/15\r\n\r\nThis issue is just here to warn you guys up.\r\nIt would be nice to find a way to warn all the other libs etc.\r\n\r\nCheers !\r\nA.",
