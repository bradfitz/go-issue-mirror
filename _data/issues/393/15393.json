	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version devel +3e9264c Tue Apr 19 09:21:57 2016 +0000 linux/ppc64le\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\ngo version\r\ngo env\r\nGOARCH=\"ppc64le\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"ppc64le\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/home/boger/golang/sys\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/home/boger/golang/base/go\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/home/boger/golang/base/go/pkg/tool/linux_ppc64le\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -pthread -fmessage-length=0 -fdebug-prefix-map=/tmp/go-build593602443=/tmp/go-build -gno-record-gcc-switches\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\nTrying to keep with some recent changes to fsnotify.  Originally there was a problem in src/syscall related to the epoll syscalls.  Changes have been made to fsnotify to now use corresponding code in golang.org/x/sys/unix, which is similar but not quite in sync with the main golang repository.  So there are failures with the latest fsnotify code.  Earlier versions (the ones used with distro Docker builds) continue to work fine.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nfsnotify test pass on latest\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nfsnotify test failed to build on latest repo (older version v1.2.0 works)\r\n\r\nWe need to add the changes for the EpollEvent struct that were recently added to the golang repository src/syscall so that golang.org/x/sys/unix also uses the correct structure when the epoll syscalls return information.  In addition, there are some other functions in the golang repository src/syscall that are missing from golang.org/x/sys/unix that need to be added.  Working on a fix.\r\n\r\nHere are the errors we are seeing due to missing functions:\r\ngo get -u golang.org/x/sys/unix github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify\r\n\r\nsrc/github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/inotify.go:39: undefined: unix.InotifyInit\r\nsrc/github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/inotify_poller.go:48: undefined: unix.Pipe2\r\n\r\n",
