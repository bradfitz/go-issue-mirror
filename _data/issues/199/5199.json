A workaround would be separating registering events\nfor stream listeners which call listen and others.\n\nUse of EV_RECEIPT:\nUnfortunately both of NetBSD and OpenBSD don't support it yet.\nIt would be needed to implement similar stuff when we should support\na capricious event that leaving and arriving frequently, or should support\nbulk registration.\u003c/pre\u003e",
