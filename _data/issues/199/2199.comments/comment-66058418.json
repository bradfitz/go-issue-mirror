Original issue was about making go\nexecutables inspect-able by mingw tools, like nm and objdump. Making them inspect-able\nby MS tools would be another issue altogether, because MS symbol formats are not\ndocumented (as far as I know). MS exe internals are accessible via spacial Windows api.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
