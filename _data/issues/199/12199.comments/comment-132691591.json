The goal first goes haywire after the long GC cycle at ~2.2s caused by a low trigger; that gives the mutator a lot of time to allocate during the cycle (in fact, you can see how much it allocates during the cycle), and all of that allocation gets subtracted from the marked heap size before computing the goal of the next cycle.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't explain why the trigger first drops so low in the cycle at 2.2s.",
