Given that DNS validation requires integrating with my DNS provider, I’ll probably use `lego` instead of `crypto/acme`, given that `lego` already has [cloudflare integration](https://github.com/xenolf/lego/blob/master/providers/dns/cloudflare/cloudflare.go).\r\n\r\nI’m closing this issue as there’s nothing we can do right now about LetsEncrypt/the ACME spec not supporting arbitrary ports, and you’ve referenced the appropriate tracking bugs on their end.",
