It doesn't *have* to live in the\nstandard library--you could turn this into a separate go-gettable package.  But of\ncourse we do have io.MultiReader.  But then io.MultiReader seems to have more clear\nuses.  But the App Engine use case is compelling.\n\nSee what people think on the mailing list.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **release-none**._",
