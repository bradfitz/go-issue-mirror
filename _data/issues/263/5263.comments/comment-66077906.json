I think we have click-click-click installers, even.\n\nIn the theory yes. At least for java, python and another\nzillion languages. In the praxis is every Go binary blocked by\nan antivirus (known issue since a long time) and I'm not allowed\nto disable that madness.\n\nI disabled the virus scanning for C:/go but if somebody compiles\nsomething, it get blocked, deleted, what ever. Great.\nIt isn't easy to teach Go;)\u003c/pre\u003e",
