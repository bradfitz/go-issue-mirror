That's what src/all.bash (or all.bat) uses.\n\nThe HTTP leak tests don't run with -short.\n\nThe full tests for net/http pass on Darwin and Linux, and I don't do http development on\nany other platforms.\n\nIf you want to fix the leaks(?) and/or flaky tests(?) on Windows, feel free, but it's\nnot a priority for me currently.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-someday**, removed **priority-triage**._",
