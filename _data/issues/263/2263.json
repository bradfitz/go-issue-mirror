	"body": "by **branimirkaradzic**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n - Run http.ListenAndServeTLS server.\n - When connecting client, initiate TLS negotiation, but don't complete it. Client must not write nor close connection in order to reproduce this bug.\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n - Server doesn't block processing incoming connections when negotiating TLS with client.\n - Server drops client after read/write timeout specified in http.Server struct.\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nServer becomes unresponsive.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nLinux\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?
