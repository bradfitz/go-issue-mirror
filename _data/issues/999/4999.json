	"body": "by **viriketo**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003e1. What is a short input program that triggers the error?\n\nI don't have such a small program. Only a big program (open source), after a long run\nprocessing lots of data. How could I supply enough information, without the big program?\n\nI can provide gdb traces and so on.\n\n2. What is the full compiler output?\n\nThe compiler works fine, but the code works with gc, fails with gccgo:\npanic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference\n[signal 0xb code=0x1 addr=0x0]\n\ngoroutine 1 [chan receive]:\nunexpected fault address 0x0\nunexpected fault address tar: Final de l'arxiu inesperat\n\n3. What version of the compiler are you using?  (Run it with the -V flag.)\n\nI built with: go build -gccgoflags -O2\u003c/pre\u003e",
