Doing\nthat amounts to a way to silently break Go programs.  See \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/6245\"\u003eissue #6245\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nWhat is the actual problem you are trying to solve?  The pack program used to have an\noption to remove prefixes from file names, but we may have lost that feature when we\nadded the -pack option to gc and rewrote the pack program in Go.  Would restoring that\nfeature fix your problem?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **release-none**._",
