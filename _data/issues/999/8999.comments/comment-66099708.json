I feel being able to strip this information\nis important to anyone who is distributing their binaries to other people.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/d-t_CfWFxhQ/F83J-Oyde-AJ\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/d-t_CfWFxhQ/F83J-Oyde-AJ\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\u003e\u003e A workaround is just to build in a VM with generic username and home directory.\n\u003e It's not just the username and home directory. The path for different packages are\nalso inserted which may leak some of the project names and internal package names.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/d-t_CfWFxhQ/esLu0TIndYMJ\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/d-t_CfWFxhQ/esLu0TIndYMJ\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
