This is then relayed to the remote server as a chunked\nrequest of zero bytes.\n\nFirst step of the fix is the assume 0 bytes on a GET request that doesn't mention a body:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/4667041\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/4667041\u003c/a\u003e\n\nNext step (CL forthcoming) is to do implement rsc's earlier suggestion of test-reading a\nsingle byte from the Body reader when the Content-Length is zero to see if it's actually\nzero or defaulted to zero from being unspecified.\u003c/pre\u003e",
