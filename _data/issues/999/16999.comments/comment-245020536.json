( Which is more difficult the more places there are were string([]byte) temporaries are made for the runtime without allocating a new string but just as a unsafe view on an existing byteslice )\r\n- performance would be a secondary concern (need to benchmark) but it is generally nice to have less globally synchronized variables if they can be easily replaced by other mechanisms.",
