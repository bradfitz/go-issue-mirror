	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\nGo version 1.7.3\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nWindows 10 Home 64-bit, with Sublime Text IDE (with GoSublime)\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\nHad different projects, each containing a package with the same name, and then in one of the projects, created a go file that used of one of the packages and called goimports to suggest an import line.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nI was hoping to see goimports suggesting an import line that is closer to the current file. In this case, it should suggest the package in the current project. \r\n\r\nOr if there are multiple packages with the same name within the same project, it should suggest an import line that is closer to the current file.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\nGoimports currently suggests a random import line for packages with the same name, which is often inaccurate at times. It often suggests a same-name package from different projects, which is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nIf goimports can understand which import line is closer, it will appear to better understand the context of the package being imported and act more intelligently.\r\n\r\n",
