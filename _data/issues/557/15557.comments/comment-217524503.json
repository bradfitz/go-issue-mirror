	"body": "I agree with the idea of freezing packages, but I would like to try to separate that idea from \"retained for compatibility\", which makes it sound like we've decided the package doesn't even belong in the standard library. That's a separate attribute from \"complete enough and shouldn't be added to or changed\". Maybe frozen is the wrong word since it sounds like what we did with syscall. \"completed\" or \"stable\" might be less judgmental.",
