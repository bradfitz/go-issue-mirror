Can somebody describe what connStmt/putConn are trying to achieve?\r\n\r\nI would expect that connStmt must be a pop from a stack/queue and putConn must be a push to the stack/queue. And the rest must be designed around that idea. E.g. if a connection can't be used, then it must not be in the stack/queue.\r\n\r\n",
