Once you've done that you are in trouble and there is nothing reliable we can do to fix it--are we going to also block sed, awk, ls, all the programs that a Makefile might run?\r\n\r\nIf we are going to do something here, the PATH is the thing to tackle, though I don't know how.  I don't think we should be in the business of telling people that they can not write a \"rm\" program in Go.",
