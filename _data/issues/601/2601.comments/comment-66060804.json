But on Windows I get these \"unexpected fault address 0xffffffff\" errors. I'm\ninitializing two structures cef_app_t/cef_client_t and setting methods on them such as\n\"add_ref\" and \"release\". These methods are later called by external Chromium library.\nThe error happens after the first call to \"add_ref\" made by Chromium. In import \"C\" the\n\"cef_base.h\" is included\n(\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/CzarekTomczak/cef2go/blob/master/handlers/cef_base.h#L59)\"\u003ehttps://github.com/CzarekTomczak/cef2go/blob/master/handlers/cef_base.h#L59)\u003c/a\u003e which sets\nthese methods.\n\nIs there any fix for this that I could apply on my own?\u003c/pre\u003e",
