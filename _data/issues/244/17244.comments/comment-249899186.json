	"body": "I have a very different opinion. I think there is significant value in having a set of \"semi-blessed\" packages, and random packages that can be found (more or less easily) on godoc.org do not meet that bar. I think one of the big reasons that languages like Python have taken off is that they are \"batteries included\"; their ~standard libraries include a wide swath of functionality, such that the average program can be written without adding any third-party libraries. If anything, I think more should be included than we have now.\r\n\r\nI think the x repos today have already improved on the \"batteries included\" model, by making it clear that \"these are good packages, but they're not great packages, and we don't make as many promises about them\". I would actually like to see a future where we include a snapshot of the x repos in release tarballs, attaching the same disclaimer.\r\n\r\nI see your proposal as directly advocating for fewer packages in x. I disagree that that is a worthy goal.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't think that #2 and #3 necessarily have to live in the same place as #1 and #4. I would be happy to separate the \"random part of the Go project\" repos from the \"semi-blessed packages\" repos.",
