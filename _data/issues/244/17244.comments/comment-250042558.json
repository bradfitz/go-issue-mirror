I've been talking to people about this problem for years.  I don't have a solution.  I'm not aware of any language that has a good solution.  Other languages have varying solutions of varying quality.  None seem clearly better than what Go is doing, which is basically godoc.org.\r\n\r\nI think that golang.org/x is not a solution.  I think it's basically exclusionary.  It privileges the packages that the core Go team happens to care about, and relegates the rest to limbo.  That doesn't scale.\r\n\r\nBut letting all packages into golang.org/x also doesn't work.  The end result of that is basically what we have today--an undifferentiated list of packages of varying and unknown quality, but with different package names.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is some way to identify quality packages.  That is the problem.  It seems to me that golang.org/x is not the solution to that problem.\r\n\r\nBut I could of course be wrong.  Perhaps golang.org/x is the solution.  But not as it exists today; it has to be different.  So how do we change it to make it work?",
