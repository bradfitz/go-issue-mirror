For example, @peterbourgon has had great success with his go-kit project, attracting people to do high level design work. I could be wrong, but I don't think you'll see much difference between participation at \"github.com/goaudio\" or \"golang.org/x/audio\". I personally would be just as interested either way.\r\n\r\n\u003e The role of the Go project should be to review and bless fundamental things, especially the APIs. And that's where the proposal system can be sufficient enough.\r\n\r\nTo repeat what I think you said: the equivalent of package `io` for audio or video could live in a sub-repository of the Go project. Those are small but require careful review and pride of place. The packages that use those interfaces must not necessarily live in the sub-repos.\r\n\r\nI agree with this completely.\r\n\r\n\u003e I would like to hear more from the actual part-time contributors and I am devastated by \"+1, ship it\" type one-line responses.\r\n\r\nI am sensitive to your concerns about \"throwing people out of the project\". That's certainly a non-goal, here. But, for the record, nobody has said \"ship it\" because there is nothing to ship. Brad and Robert have agreed with what I said, but nobody has proposed any kind of policy yet.\r\n\r\nI too would like to hear from more contributors (or potential contributors), particularly to expand upon the list of reasons that code should live in /x, and where people think the line should be drawn.",
