If anything, I think more should be included than we have now.\r\n\r\nBoth Python and Go have suffered from having large standard libraries, too. In some cases, the standard libraries have become out of date and superseded by other packages in the ecosystem (or in the case of Python's urllib, by urllib2 in the same standard library!). Then we're left with prominent packages that are not suitable for common use. That's a net loss for our users.\r\n\r\nIf I understand your sentiment, you're advocating for including (a lot) more packages in the x/ repositories, as an extension to the standard library. Producing our current standard library (not the sub-repositories) was a massive concerted effort over many years, by people who are mostly domain experts in the functionality of those packages. I have two main questions:\r\n\r\n1. Who is going to do this work? How do you propose we maintain the same quality level across many more packages that our well outside our areas of expertise?\r\n2. Why does it need to go in x/? Why should we be the arbiters of which packages are prominent? Aren't we short-changing the ecosystem by neglecting third-party package support?",
