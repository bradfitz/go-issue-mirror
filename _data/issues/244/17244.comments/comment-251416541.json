	"body": "**Q: What should go in golang.org/x ?**\r\n\r\nAs the proposer of #16257 (and other subrepo requests in the past, some accepted, and some not), my criteria for if I propose a project be moved into the x/ namespace is generally \"do I think this would be useful in the standard library eventually, eg. `context`, or do I think it could be vendored in the standard library to support other packages, eg. that sasl proposal?)\r\n\r\nIf the answer to both of those questions is no, I probably would prefer to keep it to myself.\r\n\r\nThe only place I make a slight exception to this is when I consider security and crypto related packages. Eg. with the SASL proposal I feel that it's important to have a single, known-good, well-vetted implementation. Fair or not, having it under golang.org/x/ will make people assume it's the \"recommended\" solution, and the process (and intelligent developers that are a part of this community), would hopefuly ensure that nothing horrible slips through the cracks, so security packages get slightly different considerations for me.\r\n\r\n**Q: How to fix the Go team bandwidth issue?**\r\n\r\nI think the answer hear is to allow third parties and trusted domain experts to act as the maintainer of some packages in the subrepos. There's no reason the Go team has to manage every single package themselves. This doesn't mean all authors immediately get commit access or review access, but it might mean that eventually long-time contributors and others that have shown that they can be responsible and maintain the standards expected in the subrepos could take some of the review and merge burden off the core team.",
