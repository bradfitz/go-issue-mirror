	"body": "Speaking of the OP, another reason for inclusion would be to provide an official package for interoperating about (but not necessarily doing) X.\r\n\r\nFor example, person foo might write a flac decoder. Company bar might write an mp3 encoder. It would be nice to have some common interfaces so that the two can plug together. Such interfaces could conceivably be under x/ without requiring either a flac or mp3 package to be under x/.\r\n\r\nThe existing x/image/math/f32 and x/image/math/f64 packages roughly have this intent. It's not hard for any one particular repository to define useful matrix types, but interop between graphics packages from different repos is awkward unless there's canonical types. I'm not sure if these particular x/image/math/f?? packages have been widely adopted in practice, though.",
