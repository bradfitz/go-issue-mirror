Approval would have a certain scope, but then actual reviews and work would be community driven.  If someone wanted to have a GUI widget library, a new package wouldn't get approved, rather they would be instructed to go talk to the ext/shiny contributors.\r\n\r\nedit: but to be clear, I'm not directly advocating more packages go into an x like repo.",
