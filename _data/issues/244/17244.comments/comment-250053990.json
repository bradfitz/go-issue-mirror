	"body": "@rakyll Sorry for simply repeating @bradfitz 's and thus @adg 's words. I don't have a solution either, but (repeating what's been said before) as the sub-repos are used now, they imply some form of \"approval\" by the Go team, yet they have essentially historically grown. In fact, several packages from the std/lib landed in sub-repos (for lack of a better place) when we cleaned up the std repo a few years back. And I have \"stuff\" in there (x/tools) which perhaps should be elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI'd love if our sub-repos were blessed somehow and of high quality and maybe even maintained by us (if we could). But it doesn't scale and it's not necessarily even good for the community.\r\n\r\nI agree w/ @ianlancetaylor that some mechanism to qualify and identify high-quality packages would be a much better solution. The question is how to do that. The Go team has neither the manpower nor the expertise (we don't have domain experts in all areas) to do that at scale.\r\n\r\nPerhaps part of the solution is to bless a location where such high-quality packages land in the first place, and then come up with a process to rate them.\r\n",
