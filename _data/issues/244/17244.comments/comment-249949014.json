	"body": "As a consumer of many third-party packages, I think I agree with @quentinmit (or at least with @ianlancetaylor). If I need a package for $task and there is an /x package for $task, I've generally found that while it might be incomplete, it's usually of high quality (the scope and style matches the standard library; the test coverage is quite good; the documentation is thorough and concise). If I have to go browsing through $task packages on godoc.org and pick the best one, it's often of such poor quality that I either do an extensive cleanup/refactoring/testing/docs pass before bringing it into my repo or else I choose to write my own package instead.\r\n\r\n@adg said:\r\n\r\n\u003e *I'd think we should address this issue by making it easier to find and recognize high quality packages.* (One way to do this is to improve godoc.org, but there are many other ways.)\r\n\r\nbut I'm skeptical that a process outside the Go team will produce a quality bar that is usefully high for me.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see [high-quality package identification mechanism] exist and be proven to work well before any trimming down of /x.",
