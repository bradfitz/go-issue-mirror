The work is not getting done. The present structure does not scale. To encourage more development that we cannot support is irresponsible and unfair to the contributors.\r\n\r\n\u003e I do think making high quality third-party packages easier to find solves a large part of this problem, but we are not there yet.\r\n\r\nMy argument is that we will never get there if we use the sub-repos as a crutch.",
