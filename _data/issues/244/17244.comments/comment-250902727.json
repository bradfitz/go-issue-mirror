	"body": "I put mobile under golang.org/x because it gave us common tooling with the Go project, in particular gerrit and the issue tracker. I think that was reasonable at the time, given that golang.org/x didn't have any clear meaning.\r\n\r\nLooking at where @adg is going with this proposal, I suspect it will not belong there any more. (Especially as a lot of us working on it have had our time taken by other projects, it should have a separate issue tracker.) It could move to github.com/google/gomobile, though I will miss gerrit.\r\n\r\nI would miss gerrit even more for x/exp/shiny. It would be nice if there were some other place that had the common tools of the Go project but did not come with the fancy golang.org/x prefix (or any other implications of being part of the standard library.)",
