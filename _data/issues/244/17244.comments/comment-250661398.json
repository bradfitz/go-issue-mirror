This would mean _if_ `mobile` was considered a subsystem for go packages, it would have maintainers with expertise in that area. Maybe they wrote the package to begin with. Maybe they have contributed heavily after it was open-sourced. They would not be responsible for anything else (unless they had other expertise and were willing). Same goes for `usb` if that is deemed a subsystem. \r\nI agree this shouldn't be for \"Yet Another Framework\". It should really only be used for low-level core libraries. You could almost make the analogy that \"Debian\" is not a subsystem of Linux ;) it merely uses it :)",
