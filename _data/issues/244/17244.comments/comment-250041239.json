A foundational package is a core network protocol implementation, a core abstract (io package abstractions), an open standard implementation, an industry-wide standard, etc.\r\n\r\n\u003e Those are small but require careful review and pride of place.\r\n\r\nI totally agree with that.\r\n\r\nI think one of the Go project's goals should be prioritization of requirements from the language and collaborating with experts to review designs. This proposal should address that aspect before being finalized.\r\n\r\n\u003e Brad and Robert have agreed with what I said, but nobody has proposed any kind of policy yet.\r\n\r\nWell, ok. I am just a bit worried when influential people are on the threads without arguments. Because it influences which side people lean towards in the end.",
