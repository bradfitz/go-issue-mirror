The question is what that mechanism should be.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage I see with the current golang.org/x system is that these packages are effectively owned by the core Go developers.  That isn't scalable or even desirable.  If we can solve that problem within the golang.org/x name space, then, fine.  But how?  And who controls the golang.org/x name space?\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to have a scalable mechanism for identifying and maintaining good packages, and I don't see why that should be, or even can be, associated with golang.org/x.",
