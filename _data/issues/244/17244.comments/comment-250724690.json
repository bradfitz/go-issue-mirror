Its slower, needs a manifest, and does not like\ndedicated server port stacks. net/rpc, whether with gob or JSON, ist\nworking code for us. Please don't sunset it.\n\nOn 30 September 2016 at 00:36, Andrew Gerrand \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e @StabbyCutyou \u003chttps://github.com/StabbyCutyou\u003e thanks for clarifying.\n\u003e It's hard to divine the context behind everyone's posts, and I'm sure I\n\u003e misinterpreted you. Sorry. ðŸ˜¦\n\u003e\n\u003e Go has a lot of really strong libraries that come out of the box - as a\n\u003e developer the idea of seeing Go \"shrink\" in this capacity would be\n\u003e disappointing\n\u003e\n\u003e When I talked about taking stuff out of the standard library I was\n\u003e referring to things like net/rpc which was an early experiment and is now\n\u003e clearly inadequate as a production rpc mechanism, having been superseded by\n\u003e several other rpc systems.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/17244#issuecomment-250611740\u003e, or mute\n\u003e the thread\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AEAf7CaR6guzv4y0cugoj8jdzk6IEr5Cks5qvD1VgaJpZM4KHJNI\u003e\n\u003e .\n\u003e\n",
