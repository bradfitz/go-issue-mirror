It's not just that we're exhausted, but also that we're falling behind, with no end in sight. Your proposed solution just creates more work for those people, therefore it is not a solution, as it will never happen.\r\n\r\n\u003e The strongest part of Go is the community itself, and the community desperately wants to be involved in helping to shape the future of the language.\r\n\r\nThis isn't about the future of the language. It's about libraries. IMO if high quality libraries cannot thrive outside the project itself, then the language will have failed. How could any of today's major languages succeeded without high quality external libraries? We're not going to get there byÂ gatekeeping.\r\n",
