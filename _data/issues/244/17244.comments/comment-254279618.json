For example, if fsnotify wasn't under the Google CLA, could guru or godoc or `go build` still use fsnotify? Likewise with brotli or other core/low-level packages like USB.\r\n\r\nEither way, (IMO) the CLA used should be orthogonal to the location of the code, e.g. grpc-go still has the Google CLA.",
