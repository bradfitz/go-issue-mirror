I am not proposing to establish a general-purpose support group.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e\u003e If we're talking only about foundational packages (and does that mean that we've decided that the policy on x/ sub-repos is \"foundational only\"?), doesn't the golang-dev mailing list already fulfil this role? It seems like https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/ofaaIJPWRKg/7jX3Qf5hBQAJ is exactly the sort of conversation that you're looking for.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e I am not sure if we can use this channel if this proposal is accepted. If yes, I wouldn't care about not being able to communicate to the others. golang-dev@ is the perfect solution to reach out.\r\n\r\nIn case anyone is confused, I did write the \"doesn't the golang-dev mailing list already fulfil this role?\" paragraph as a comment on this issue, but later deleted it as I thought it was derailing the original post, which is about deciding policy for sub-repositories. There already is some confusion: \"if this proposal is accepted\" was met with \"What proposal? I want to remind everyone that nothing has actually been proposed\". I suppose that the e-mail went out anyway, and was quoted in full in a reply, so it's been effectively undeleted.",
