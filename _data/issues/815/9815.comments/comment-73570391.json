(Not sure why this is being brought up.)\r\n\r\nI just found it very ackward when I encountered it - I asked on IRC and as people agreed and so I opened the issue. I guess the title is a little misleading as it doesn't really have to be solved that way. It just expresses the expectations I had. If there is another way of making it more seamless I would be all for it.\r\n\r\nThe cost/benefit decision. Well, right now I had to learn that I cannot use types as parameters (for the sizeof). I am not sure that the learning is really an argument (in this case). The intend to not increase the language complexity to keep the implementation simpler I can relate to.\r\n\r\nBut anyway - all I am saying: it feels off like it is. Maybe think of this when working on go 2.x.",
