That's useful when you don't have a named type at your hand, for instance.\r\n\r\nThere are many exceptions in the unsafe package for pragmatic reasons - having a Sizeof return a constant makes it more useful because it can be used in array declarations and constant expressions.\r\n\r\nYou may want a different Sizeof, but that's not the definition of unsafe.Sizeof.",
