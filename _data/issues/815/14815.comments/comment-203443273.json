If you\nneed to get in ahead of http.ServeMux and prevent the defined redirects,\nthe way to do that today is to define your own mux in front of it and pass\nthat to http.Serve or http.ListenAndServe.\n\nOn Wed, Mar 30, 2016 at 4:53 AM Maxim Ignatenko \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e Okay, then what do you think about making http.ServeMux use EscapedPath()\n\u003e ?
