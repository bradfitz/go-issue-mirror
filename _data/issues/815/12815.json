	"body": "Kubernetes builders on GKE (Google Container Engine) don't support privileged pods.\r\n\r\nThis means our builds run as user not-really-but-kinda root. They can do lots of things root normally can, but they can't run some of the Linux exec tests.\r\n\r\nIf we don't run as root, the buildlet has a bunch of misc problems, so it's easier for us to run as root for now and skip some tests.\r\n\r\nThis bug exists to explain the situation and track CLs which skip tests on Kubernetes (environment: IN_KUBERNETES == \"1\")\r\n\r\nWhen GKE fixes things so users can run privileged pods we can remove the skips.\r\n\r\nWe won't be losing any test coverage overall, though, because we'll keep some Linux builders still running as VMs as root. Only the trybots will use Kubernetes with that test skipped for now.\r\n\r\n/cc @evandbrown",
