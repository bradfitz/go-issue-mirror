No matter the underlying architecture, the code is nicer to write and a compiler will likely be able to generate better code. The ability for a compiler to recognize patterns that amount to the same effect is orthogonal to this feature.\r\n\r\nThat said, we're not going to make language changes of this magnitude at this point. Marked this for Go2, just so we have a record of this discussion.",
