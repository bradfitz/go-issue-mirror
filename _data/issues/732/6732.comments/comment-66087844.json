I have a usecase where I want to return (very) slightly modified\nresponse based on which IP the client used to connect to. And for a particular reason I\nwould like to use the same process to serve all IP. I could perhaps get away with\nregistering multiple servers each listening to a different IP and using custom handler\nfor each server... but it sounds ugly.\u003c/pre\u003e",
