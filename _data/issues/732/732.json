What do you see instead?\nThe package should import. Error \u0026quot;can't find import\u0026quot;  \n\n\nIn the importfile function of lex.c, once a local package is identified, \nby a call to islocalname, the fully qualified file name is assembled and \nfindpkg is called. findpkg makes a call to islocalname with the fully \nqualified file name (fqfn) and on windows the call will always fail.       \n\nE.g. say we have: import \u0026quot;./svg\u0026quot; \n\nThe importfile function makes a call to islocalname with \u0026quot;./svg\u0026quot;, if the \ncall passes the fqfn is assembled and findpkg is called. Contrasting fqfns:\n\n  - OSX: /Users/jpoirier/svgo/svg \n  - Windows: C:\\Users/jpoirier/svgo/svg\n\nfindpkg calls islocalname passing the fqfn as a parameter. islocalname \nchecks the first few characters of the fqfn against \u0026quot;/\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;./\u0026quot;, or\n\u0026quot;../\u0026quot; \nwhich always fails on windows because of the unique fqfn.\u003c/pre\u003e",
