It is unfortunate that,\nsolely to run an external benchmark, a new dependency has been introduced. Is the glib\ndependency really necessary?\n\nIf the glib dependency is necessary, there is a bug in Revision f33da81baac2. The\ndocumentation for the \"Install C tools, if needed\", section of \"Installing Go from\nsource\" does not list libglib2.0-dev as one of the external libraries for Ubuntu/Debian.\n\u003ca href=\"http://tip.golang.org/doc/install/source#ctools\"\u003ehttp://tip.golang.org/doc/install/source#ctools\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
