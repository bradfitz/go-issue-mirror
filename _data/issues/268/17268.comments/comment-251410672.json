	"body": "First question: what standards to Chrome, Firefox and Safari implement?\r\n\r\nAccording to local domain experts (one of the authors of UTS #46), most, if not all, browsers currently use UTS #46 which was introduced by The Unicode consortium as a transition standard between IDNA 2003 and IDNA 2008, minimizing the substantial incompatibility between them. \r\n\r\nThe UTS #46 standard provides (roughly) two versions: with and without compatibility processing. Browsers may be in different modes w.r.t. removing compatibility processing in the transition to IDNA 2008, but for the browsers I tested compatibly processing seems to be the norm.\r\n\r\nLooking at the spec, it is not quite trivial to implement it, but also not too hard. I'll look into supporting UTS #46.",
