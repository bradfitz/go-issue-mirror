I agree that a poor fix is not an improvement and\nrigorous validation isn't worth the expense here.  However, I think an inexpensive check\nto make sure the date is at least possible is a good fix.  February 29 is possible but\nFebruary 30 will never happen (except in the corporate world, where it might be\nconvenient to extend a fiscal year beyond its usual boundary??).\n\nNo response necessary if you still disagree.  Otherwise, I'm willing to submit a patch\nand documentation.\u003c/pre\u003e",
