I also think a poor fix is not an\nimprovement. I would rather document the behavior, which is simple to understand. It's\neasy, if a little more expensive, to validate the returned string (except, again, for\nthe killer cases) for those very few systems that require rigorous date validation.\u003c/pre\u003e",
