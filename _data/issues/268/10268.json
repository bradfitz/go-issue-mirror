	"body": "A C++ program can trigger the Go signal handler from a global constructor before any cgo calls are made. As badsignal uses cgocallback, this requires an extra M be initialized. This was done for #10207, as it appears to sometimes happen with the os/signal tests on darwin/arm.\r\n\r\nIt needs a robust test.\r\n\r\nThere also needs to be some decision made about how this interacts with the deadlock detector. (Perhaps another issue.)\r\n\r\n/cc @dvyukov ",
