Because if it happens in a global ctor (in the main thread), then if a signal is delivered before Go runtime is initialized, then it also has not setup own signal handlers, thus badsignal won't be invoked; if it happens after runtime initialization, then the main thread also has a valid g/m, thus badsignal won't be invoked as well.\r\n\r\n",
