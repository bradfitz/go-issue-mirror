I can see\nhow it could be construed that that if the object is not garbage collected the finaliser\ncannot run, however runtime.GC() does not currently guarentee that all memory that can\nbe collected will be collected (see comment #3), and even if the memory was collected,\nit is not guarenteed that the finaliser will not be run, because no such guarentee is\nmade.\n\nPlease, let's not talk about runtime.GC has having anything to do with this issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
