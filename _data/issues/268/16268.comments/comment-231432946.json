No \"b\" joy to be had.\r\n\r\nTried mucking about with the suggestions from @axengine \u0026 @hyangah, but no joy from my efforts there either (although take those efforts with a large, ham fisted flavor of newbie salt).\r\n\r\nGuess I'll just turn my attention to the working iOS example until this is sorted and wait patiently for Elias to figure out the issue.  (Good luck and thanks Elias \u0026 others!)",
