Once you've already sent the headers, ServeContent can no longer do If-Modified-Since or Range requests, etc. At that point there's little functionality it's providing that you can't more easily do yourself for your custom 500 handler.\r\n\r\nI think changing this behavior would just be encouraging people in the wrong direction. I'm content saying that it should only be used prior to writing headers.\r\n",
