	"body": "by **Jens.Alfke**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe code for masking outgoing frames in hybi.go is very inefficient. It starts with an\nempty byte array and uses append() to append the masked bytes one at a time. This\nresults in a lot of unnecessary allocations, especially with larger frames. It showed up\nclearly as a hot-spot in some CPU profiling I did with a project that sends frames on\nthe order of 50kbytes.\n\nIt's very easy to fix this code to preallocate the array to the correct size and copy\nthe masked bytes into it in a tight loop. This has a pretty dramatic effect on\nperformance.\n\nAttached is the fix as a tiny two-line patch based on commit adcbdfde2e2f (which was tip\na few days ago).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5269/0/websocket.patch\"\u003ewebsocket.patch\u003c/a\u003e (473 bytes)",
