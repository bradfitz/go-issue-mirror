	"body": "In https://github.com/golang/go/commit/acefcb732cae4daa59a621cb102793860b564a12 three new constants were added for seeking positions in a stream of bytes.\r\n\r\nbytes.Reader, strings.Reader, and io.SectionReader currently do not use these constants and instead use 0, 1, and 2.\r\n\r\nSince packages bytes and strings (and by default io) all import io, it'd make sense to use those constants internally for their Readers' `Seek` methods.\r\n\r\nIMO it doesn't make sense to import io into any other packages for the sake of using named constants.\r\n\r\nIt's a rather trivial issue but it would clarify the source code which iirc was one of the reasons for having defined constants.",
