To build our tools, we\nhave created a project-level Makefile that builds go and the other tools. This process\nfails because \u0026quot;gomake\u0026quot; prints \u0026quot;Entering directory\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Leaving\ndirectory\u0026quot; messages when executed in this environment.\n\nI have written a patch that fixes this. Providing the --no-print-directory option to\ngomake ensures that gomake does not print \u0026quot;Entering directory\u0026quot; and\n\u0026quot;Leaving directory\u0026quot; messages. Without this patch, gomake prints these messages\nwhen the Go build process is invoked from another Makefile. This breaks the Go build\nprocess. The --no-print-directory option is already used in several other places within\nthe Go build process.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1269/0/go-0001-Invoke-gomake-with-no-print-directory.patch\"\u003ego-0001-Invoke-gomake-with-no-print-directory.patch\u003c/a\u003e (1531 bytes)",
