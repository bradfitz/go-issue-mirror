Unfortunately just copying /opt/go/src/net to my local directory and changing import \"net\" to import \"../net\" does not work. It says \"imports internal/singleflight: use of internal package not allowed\". Copying /opt/go/src/internal, too, does not help. Copying \"net\" and \"internal\" to $GOPATH/src does not work (without changing import \"net\") either. They are simply ignored and the global system version keeps being used.",
