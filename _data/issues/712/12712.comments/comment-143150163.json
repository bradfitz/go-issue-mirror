	"body": "I'm repeating myself but I really need to drive this point home: My application, like many, resolves host names provided by users. Users make mistakes, especially typos. When LookupIP() fails I write the error into a log file and users look at that log file. It makes a HUGE difference if that log file says \"host not found\" or \"server misbehaving\". It's the difference between allowing the user to quickly realize he's made a typo and fix the problem himself or forcing the user to file a support request with me that will lead to a fruitless discussion unpleasant to both sides about a DNS server and system configuration that neither I nor the user have under our control.",
