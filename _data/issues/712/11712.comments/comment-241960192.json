I ask because I'm running into a similar issue (posted on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39090669/golang-empty-location-on-mac-osx-when-parsing-time) about it if it's helpful to see), though I think I now understand why. I was seeing inconsistencies with how an RFC 3339 time was interpreted on my local machine vs. on a CI server (and on the Go Playground). Please bear with my examples to see if I understand correctly!\r\n\r\n(1) `\"2017-08-15T22:30:00+00:00\"` is interpreted as having 0 hour offset. If the system's local time has a 0 hour offset (such as UTC), then the `Location` in the parsed `time.Time` value has `UTC` as its location string. If the system's local time has _any other_ offset, then the `Location` has an empty string for its location string. This is suggested by this line in [the docs](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Parse) of `Parse`:\r\n\r\n\u003e When parsing a time with a zone offset like -0700, if the offset corresponds to a time zone used by the current location (Local), then Parse uses that location and zone in the returned time. Otherwise it records the time as being in a fabricated location with time fixed at the given zone offset.\r\n\r\nSince the CI server in question has its time set to UTC (as does the Go Playground), then UTC is set to be the location. Since my local machine does _not_ have its timezone set to UTC, a \"fabricated\" location is set.\r\n\r\n(2) `2017-08-15T22:30:00Z` is interpreted as being `UTC` no matter what; the `Z` carries both the fact that there is a 0 hour offset, and that it is in `UTC`. Parsing such a string works the same way on my local machine as our CI server and the Go Playground.\r\n\r\nThose two examples are shown here: https://play.golang.org/p/mYkMhS9sJT (with the output I see on my local machine included).\r\n\r\nIf all of that is correct, I guess my last question is: is `+00:00` supposed to imply UTC? I'm assuming someone else has thought harder about this before, but I was a little confused by [the wording in RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-4.3) here:\r\n\u003eThis differs semantically from an offset of \"Z\" or \"+00:00\", which imply that UTC is the preferred reference point for the specified time.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!",
