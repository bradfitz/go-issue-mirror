It's odd that it works one time but not the other, but it's not a bug.\n\nI don't think there is any clean way to swap reflect.Value's without using a temporary\nvalue.  The language construct x, y = y, x effectively uses two temporary values, you\njust don't see them.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **packagechange**, removed **priority-triage**._",
