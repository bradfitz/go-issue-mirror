However, it is not used when a proxy is in use.\r\n\r\nI'm calling REST APIs over https and I need to check for acceptable server certificates (a whitelist) after the handshake w/ or w/o a proxy present on the client.\r\n\r\n**Proposed**\r\n\r\nAdd an optional verification callback to tls.Config that lets the callee inspect the certs.  This would be called during the handshake for client or server.\r\n\r\n\t// VerifyPeerCertificate optionally defines a function to add\r\n\t// further restrictions on certificate validity.\r\n\t// The provided peer certificates and chains are the result \r\n\t// of the handshake and x509.Certificate.Verify calls and should\r\n\t// not be modified. The chains param will be nil if InsecureSkipVerify \r\n\t// is true. If the function returns an error, the certificate is\r\n\t// considered invalid and the connection will close.\r\n\tVerifyPeerCertificate func(peer []*x509.Certificate, chains [][]*x509.Certificate) error\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
