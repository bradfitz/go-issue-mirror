	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n1. Create a test in your package that imports any package that you don't have downloaded\nyet.\n2. `go get`\n3. `go test` - Fails due to import not found. \n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n`go get` will get the test dependencies as well, or at least have a flag to.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n`go get` doesn't get any test dependencies, so the tests fail.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nMac OS X 10.8.3\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\n1.0.3\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThere is a workaround to this, using `go list`. You can build something like this:\n\u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/mitchellh/9655102de0bc0a849cc2\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/mitchellh/9655102de0bc0a849cc2\u003c/a\u003e\n\nHowever, I feel that this is less than ideal and is counter-intuitive to the rest of the\nway that Go works. I think there should be a flag on `go get` that gets test\ndependencies.\u003c/pre\u003e",
