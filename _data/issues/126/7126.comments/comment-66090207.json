So, in tight\nloops it is possible that this goroutine is observed to spin and starve others.\n\nIs this a contrived example or does it come from a larger program ?\n\nYou could try stracing the program and seeing if those os.Stderr writes even make it to\nsyscalls.\n\nAssigning to Dmitry for his comments, I have not assigned this to a release.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-none**, **repo-main**._\n\n_Owner changed to @dvyukov._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
