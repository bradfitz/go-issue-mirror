Use go/format's Source() to format a Go program containing a comment with embedded\ntabs, e.g. \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/4qP5vyn8or\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/4qP5vyn8or\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat happened?\nSource() did not modify the comment\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\nSource() should have modified the comment to use spaces instead of tabs\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\ngo/format generally follows the rule that tabs are for indentation and spaces are for\nalignment. This ensures that source files will look correct for any possible tab width.\n\nHowever, go/format does not enforce this rule for comments. Since most editors will use\na default tab width of 8 for .go files, this means that I will sometimes run into a\nprogram whose comments use tabs for alignment, with the assumption that every editor\nwill use a tab width of 8.\n\nIt's a judgment call, but I think the correct behavior is to apply text/tabwriter to\ncomment nodes.\u003c/pre\u003e",
