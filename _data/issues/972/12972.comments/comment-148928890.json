Unfortunately, the test itself is broken, too. https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/encoding/json/decode_test.go#L313 is supposed to test the overwriting of the map. However, in https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/encoding/json/decode_test.go#L536 the initial value gets thrown away and replaced with an empty map. That way, the test doesn't actually test the overwriting of the map.",
