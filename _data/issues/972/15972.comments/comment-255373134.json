	"body": "It's true: we don't know which test case has the race. We just know that the overall test binary failed. In general test cases can run in parallel or have their background goroutines keep running after the test case is ostensibly over. So assigning races to specific test cases is harder than it sounds. Even so, if the race detector exposed the count of problems found so far, we could at least check to see if it increased during a particular test case.\n\n@dvyukov, is it easy for Go to fetch the number of reported problems out of the race detector library on demand? Thanks.",
