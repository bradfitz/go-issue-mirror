My counterargument is that Effective Go contains a\nlarge section on commentary [1], and godoc uses comments to generate documentation. Both\nof these suggest that the content of comments is not completely freeform, but rather is\nexpected to conform to a certain style. For the same reason that go fmt enforces style\nin the other parts of Go programs, I believe that it's reasonable for go fmt to enforce\nstyle in comments.\n\n[1] \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
