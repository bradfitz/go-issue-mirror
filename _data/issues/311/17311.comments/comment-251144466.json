	"body": "There is a slight bug in the documentation. As written, it technically guarantees that SetFinalizer will panic if passed a pointer to a package-level variable. That clearly isn't the case. In fact, this claim is nonsense even if you ignore package-level variables, since we can't tell the difference between passing, say, a pointer to a composite literal and a pointer to its first element. So we should change this to say that it \"*may* abort the program.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm inclined to change the *guarantee* here as well (and also the docs) to accept pointers to package-level variables just to simplify the API and its specification. I can't see how this would unduly constrain future implementations. @RLH?",
