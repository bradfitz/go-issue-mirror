	"body": "You confused the differences between documented behavior\nand actual implemented behavior.\n\nThe documented behavior is almost always a strict subset of\nactual implemented behavior, i.e. the code implements some\nunspecified behavior. In general it's not wise to depend on\nthose unspecified behaviors.\n\nFor this particular case, the documentation says you can't use\npackage level variables, but the implementation doesn't enforce\nthis, so you can actually set finalizer on package level variables,\nbut as this is not documented to be valid, it's not guaranteed to\nstay valid for future Go versions.\n\nThe current docs is the correct one, and there is no need to\ncomplicate it further (esp. the current docs already enumerates\nall valid cases, there is no need to explicitly say excluded cases\nare invalid).\n",
