This was indeed the problem... after a closer look the thrsleep() was\nreturning right away with a RET 4 meaning EINTR so something was waking it up... when it\nwoke up it checked the time of day and realized it still needed to sleep. Thanks for\nthis fix, it's working great on amd64. I'm a -current as well. Thank you again! Great\nwork. :)\u003c/pre\u003e",
