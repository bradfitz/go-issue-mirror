I knew it because I had our tools which showed me all of them.\r\n\r\n\u003e FWIW the first usage of sync.Pool that I reviewed internally did cache slices by value.\r\n\r\nI've written and reviewed code with problems too. Profiling tools help.\r\n\r\n@rasky, feel free to file a new documentation bug. This one is closed.\r\n\r\n",
