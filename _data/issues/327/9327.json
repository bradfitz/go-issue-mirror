	"body": "Tracking bug. There are a handful of x86 android devices in the wild, but what makes this target interesting is the Android Emulator. By far the best emulator uses Intel's HAXM kernel plugin to run android via hardware-assisted virtualization.\r\n\r\nIt also makes it possible to setup an android builder as two docker images (build host and android client) which would be much easier for other's to bring up and maintain.",
