However, that makes Pos() less useful to find the\nstarting position of tokens w/o the use of Next.\n\nThis scanner should probably be converted to using the new go/token/position.go\nrepresentation for positions.\n\nTemporary work-around: It may be possible to use go/scanner instead of this scanner;\ne.g. the ebnf package does this.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **g...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
