	"body": "Code generated by gobind today looks like\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public static boolean Bool(boolean p0) {\r\n        go.Seq _in = new go.Seq();\r\n        go.Seq _out = new go.Seq();\r\n        boolean _result;\r\n        _in.writeBool(p0);\r\n        Seq.send(DESCRIPTOR, CALL_Bool, _in, _out);\r\n        _result = _out.readBool();\r\n        return _result;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Seq objects clean up C allocated memory with a finalizer. This used to be necessary (and still may be in some situations), but most code can do the cleanup immediately. Even better, Seq objects can be put in a pool for reuse.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a real-world example app that is experiencing performance problems before working on this. Even though this is \"obvious\", it may turn out to be overshadowed by some other performance issues in this code.",
