	"body": "The new lifecycle events and having to deal with crosses to determine basic states are both overly complicated for an average user. Majority of the time, users don't want to have a good understanding of the lifecycle's itself but want to perform actions such as freeing resources or stopping the playback at certain states. Currently, Go mobile has a novel (invented hereâ„¢) event model that requires user to have good understanding of its novel terminology and application lifecycle details. The new event model is a big barrier for new and existing users.\r\n\r\nI'd, at least, prefer `LifecycleStageInvisible` and `LifecycleStageDestroyed` to be pushed to the user, it's very unlikely the users will be comfortable with determining these fundamental states themselves.",
