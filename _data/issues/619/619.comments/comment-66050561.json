For some \nreason the state isn't being cleaned up properly. There's an internal hash table \nwhich stores finalizer functions, and it could have a couple bugs which only show up \nunder stress. \n\nThis seems related to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/631\"\u003eissue #631\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e",
