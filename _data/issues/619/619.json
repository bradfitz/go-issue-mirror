I \nused 6g/6l and ran on a dual-socket, quad-core, dual-thread Nehalem EP \nsystem.\n\n\u0026gt; What is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\nExpected: No output.\n\nSee instead: No output with GOMAXPROCS=1 or undefined.  No output if \nmaxGoroutines is reduced from 10000 to 1000.  With GOMAXPROCS=2 or \ngreater, I get the following:\n\nfree 0x7f1ec5b52000: not an allocated block\nthrow: free mlookup\n\npanic PC=0x7f1ec57cf200\nthrow: malloc/free - deadlock\ndouble panic\n\n\u0026gt; What is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n\nGOOS=linux\nGOARCH=amd64\n\n\u0026gt; Which revision are you using?
