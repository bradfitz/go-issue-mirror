Copy the code from \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/3nLyaBE-Os\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/3nLyaBE-Os\u003c/a\u003e (or any commented code) into\nyour favourite text editor\n2. Make sure all EOL is incorrectly set/converted to CR/LF\n3. Save file as eg. crlf.go\n3. Run go fmt crlf.go\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nA crlf.go file where all the EOL are LF\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nCommented lines is still using CR/LF as EOL while all other lines is converted to LF.\nWhile it doesn't effect compiling, I can see nothing good coming from mixed usage.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows\n\nWhich version are you using?\ngo1.0.2\u003c/pre\u003e",
