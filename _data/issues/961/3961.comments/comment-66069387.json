The \\r\\n's are gone\nafterwards.\n\n(You need to copy playground source into a local file, say test.go, and run it with: \"go\nrun test.go\" because the gofmt executable is not available in the playground. Make sure\ngofmt is in your $PATH).\n\nSimilarly, when storing the source as a file with \\r\\n line endings (crlf.go) and\napplying both gofmt or go fmt, the \\r\\n's are gone and replaced by \\n's everywhere.\n\nFinally, go/scanner is testing explicitly that the \\r's are gone.\n\nPerhaps your favorite editor is doing something funny? I am going to close this. If you\nhave a concrete test case that misbehaves (executable source - no manual steps that rely\non some 3rd party editor), than you can reopen this. Thanks.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
