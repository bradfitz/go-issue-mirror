	"body": "This was considered in the early days of Go, for the symmetry withÂ other top-level declarations like var, const, import, etc. The idea was rejected on readability grounds.\r\n\r\nHere's my recollection of the reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It's too easy to scroll away from the line `func (*foo)` and forget that you're looking at a method on `*foo`, not just a function `Bar() bool`.\r\n2. It's not necessary (and sometimes undesirable) to gather in one place all method declarations for particular type, so this syntax would encourage sub-optimal code organization in some cases.\r\n3. It's often desirable to put variable or constant declarations beside related functions. This syntax discourages that, too.\r\n4. Further indentation for code blocks is undesirable.\r\n\r\nmy 2c: We do not plan to change Go's syntax in any significant way until Go 2, but even then I don't think this is something we would want to do.",
