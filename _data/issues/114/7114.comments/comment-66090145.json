The tool would then print, for all objects whose name matches the regexp, the\nset of ast.Idents which resolve to it, a bit like a \"typed\" grep.\n\nThe point of this would be:\n- to illustrate how to build and query the resolver's reference graph.\n- to prove that we can load multiple packages from source, including *_test.go files.\n- to demonstrate integration with go/build.\u003c/pre\u003e",
