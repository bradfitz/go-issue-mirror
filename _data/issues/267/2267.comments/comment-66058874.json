The\nvalue of got is not right - the strings inside are invalid, and the + operation is\nlooping. I want to debug this thoroughly - the runtime should protect itself better -\nbut in the meantime:\n\nA simple fix for this example is to change got to be a BlobRef rather than a *BlobRef\n(and remove the comparison against nil).
