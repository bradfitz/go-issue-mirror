I made a new clone of the go repository and installed it,\nand goinstalled gomatrix again. This particular issue seems to no longer appear, but it\nstill looks like it may have been a bug of some kind as regardless of what was messed up\nas far as old compiled files laying around or what ever the cause may have been, those\nwere some nasty and confusing errors (link errors perhaps?)  that probably shouldn't\nmake it all the way to a compile binary output file.\u003c/pre\u003e",
