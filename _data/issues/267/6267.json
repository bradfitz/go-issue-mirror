	"body": "\u003cpre\u003ecrypto/x509 has a hardcoded list of places to look for SSL system roots. If you're\nrunning in an environment that doesn't have them there, you're out of luck. You either\nneed to modify Go, or use chroot or similar. It'd be much nicer if there was a hook in\nthat package such that a program could point at a different place for the root\ncertificates.\u003c/pre\u003e",
