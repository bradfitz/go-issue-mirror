It generates a pointer to the type but that pointer\nis never filleed in, and always ends up nil. I thinks this should be\ncorected somehow.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/828/0/ges.tar.gz\"\u003eges.tar.gz\u003c/a\u003e (860 bytes)",
