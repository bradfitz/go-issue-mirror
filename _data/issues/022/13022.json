	"body": "I would like to open-source a package `rate` that we developed at Google.  It provides a rate limiter that supports [Context](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/context) for cancelation and deadlines: a caller can block until either the rate limiter allows the call to proceed or the Context is canceled.  It includes an optimization to skip the wait if it would exceed the Context's Deadline.  This package is widely used inside Google Go code.\r\n\r\nThere is no obvious home for this package in any of the golang repositories, so I propose we add a new subrepo, golang.org/x/time, that will contain the rate package as golang.org/x/time/rate.  To justify the creation of a new subrepo, it would be useful to identify additional packages that belong here.",
