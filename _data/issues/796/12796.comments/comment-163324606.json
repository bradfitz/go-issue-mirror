The change https://golang.org/cl/17312 kinda fixes it, at least for some cases, but ultimately it's not possible to cancel a blocked Read call, which means that without heuristics like \"wait 100ms\", RoundTrip can deadlock if the server replies before the request body is written and the request body is still being written from a forever-blocked Reader.\r\n\r\nI think I'd prefer to fix this with documentation, updating the RoundTripper docs to say that the body may still be being Read and Closed after RoundTrip returns, and that callers who want to reuse the Body have to wait on it themselves. (e.g. with a wrapped ReadCloser noting when it's done and providing synchronization)\r\n",
