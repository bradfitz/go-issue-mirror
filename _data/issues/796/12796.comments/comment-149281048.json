Because the server handler returns before reading to EOF, it sets \"Connection: close\" and interrupts the TCP connection while the client is still writing in writeLoop.\r\n\r\nSo, yes, we could wait for the writer to be done writing at body EOF (if there's a body) or before returning the body-less response headers.
