	"body": "Since 0d8366e, `net.DialTimeout` appears to no longer respect timeouts shorter than 2s. That is, if I do a `net.DialTimeout(\"tcp\", \"some-addr\", 500*time.Millisecond)` where \"some-addr\" is something that resolves quickly (with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses) but doesn't respond to connections, `net.DialTimeout` takes a little over 1s to return.\r\n\r\nThis has changed since Go 1.4.2. I don't know whether this was an intentional change, or a regression; the former change warrants a mention in the release notes.\r\n\r\n@pmarks-net @bradfitz @mikioh ",
