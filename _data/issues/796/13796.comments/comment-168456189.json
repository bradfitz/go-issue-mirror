	"body": "Adding new functionality to the standard library is a high bar.  Generally we only do it for functions needed by a web server or by lots of programs.  A go-gettable package is just as usable.\r\n\r\nIn particular, as far as I know, the C and C++ standard libraries do not have these functions.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the first step is to write the packages and make them go gettable.  Then we can discuss whether they should be added to the standard library.  So I'm closing this issue for now.",
