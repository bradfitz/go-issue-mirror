	"body": "\u003e Dealing with retries could be too low-level for syscall.Connect, but for net.Dial?\r\n\r\nI think so. Go's standard library doesn't provide anything cross-platform that is lower level than `net.Dial`.\r\n\r\n\u003e Are http, tls, syslog, rpc, smtp and textproto too low level for retries?\r\n\r\nI don't think the `http` package, for example, is too high level for retries. But it depends what part. Analogous is following redirects in HTTP requests: the `http.Client` type transparently follows redirects by default, but the lower-level `http.RoundTripper` does not (and it would be inconvenient if it did, because it is the low-level interface for making HTTP requests).\r\n\r\nI see `net.Dial` as closer to `http.RoundTripper` than `http.Client`, in the absence of anything less magical.",
