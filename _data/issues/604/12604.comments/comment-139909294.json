When I brought up this issue, I was actually trying to embed the framework into my binary which was bringing up these errors. That was the incorrect approach to begin with, so I would say this is low priority.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you want to make a well formed framework you need to make sure to symlink the Resources folder to the root level and also have an Info.plist in there.\r\n\r\nBut again, its unnecessary if you are just linking against a static framework.",
