Blank methods are ignored\nand are not part of the method set.\n\nThis option might be closest in behavior to how declarations handle blank names, but\nslightly different from how blank fields are handled in structs (blank fields are part\nof the struct for size and type identity purposes).\n\nThis option would permit interfaces with complete (and checked) method signatures, but\notherwise \"invisible\" methods, which might be useful during development. On the other\nhand, one could just comment such methods out temporarily.\u003c/pre\u003e",
