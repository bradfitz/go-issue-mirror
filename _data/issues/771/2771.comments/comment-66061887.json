It appears to\nbe responsible for including the xml tags \u0026lt;Foo\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/Foo\u0026gt;, but that\nmeans that it cannot be used for attributes, and worse I don't think\nit has the information available to figure out what tag to use:\nthe field name is unavailable.\n\nFor Go 1 it is possible that we should remove the xml.Marshaler\ninterface to enable a rethink at a later time.\n\nGustavo?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-go1**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
