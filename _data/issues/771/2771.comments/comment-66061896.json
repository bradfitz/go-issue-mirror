Before I had a Thing\nstruct and a parallel XMLThing struct (with the xml-specific tags). Then I could write\nthe xml.Header and \u0026lt;THINGS\u0026gt; myself, and then convert each Thing to an XMLThing one\nat a time for writing, finally writing \u0026lt;/THINGS\u0026gt; myself. But now that doesn't seem\npossible so I have to create an entire parallel data structure in memory. However, I\nguess that once the new xml.Marshaler interface is done, I'll be able to do the\nconversions on the fly.\n\nAlso, I notice that the xml.Encoder doesn't support time.Time at all now.\u003c/pre\u003e",
