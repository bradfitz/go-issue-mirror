In the absence of this discussion, I have put together a CL\n(\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/7379049/)\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/7379049/)\u003c/a\u003e for xml.Unmarshaler support.\n\nThis is principally for my own use as a forked package while the standard library does\nnot yet support Unmarshaler, but I figured it may provide some basis for discussion.\n\nThe CL as it stands does not correctly handle `xml:\"A\u003eB\"` tags, feeding the entire A\nelement to the Unmarshaler - I have not been able to figure out how to retain the B\nstart offset without becoming horribly tangled. Because of this I have not included\ntests in the CL.\n\nIf this is not completely off track I can spend more time on handling sub-elements and\nsubmit it for formal review (as it stands it is satisfactory for my use).\u003c/pre\u003e",
