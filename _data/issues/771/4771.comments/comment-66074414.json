Read the spec, patch this CL in, mess with it,\nand compare Python and other popular decoders' answers.\n\nI was even considering checking Python's answer with os/exec for each possible sequence\nin the new test.  If you use sys.stdout.write(quopri.decodestring(..)) instead of print,\nPython doesn't write the final newline.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @minux._\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
