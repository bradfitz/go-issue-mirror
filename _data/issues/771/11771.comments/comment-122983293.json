The only places that do are some of our standard library tests, just for convenience. It's easier for us to treat everything as binary. Nobody using Go has to write their tests this way, but we do. If you vendor Go's tests (which is fine), just be aware that we assume the world is binary in our tests. If you don't want to assume that, it's on you to also carry patches in your vendored tree to \"fix\" the tests for the updated world's assumptions. (your world with CRLF)",
