I'm pretty sure the error message is changed now:\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\brainman\u003e8g -V\n8g version weekly.2011-05-22 8604+\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\brainman\u003egoinstall tideland-cgl.googlecode.com/hg\nbash: === cd c:\\MinGW\\go\\src\\pkg\\tideland-cgl.googlecode.com\\hg; bash gomake -f- install\n--- command \"bash\" not found in $PATH\ngoinstall: installing: running bash: command \"bash\" not found in $PATH\n\nIf you update your go source to the very latest (hg up), you should see message similar\nto mine.\n\nAs to your original problem, you have to make sure you can execute gomake, therefore you\nneed bash.exe in your PATH. If you run your command from mingw command prompt, it should\nwork just fine. If you run your command from Winodws command prompt, you have to adjust\nyour PATH accordingly.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
