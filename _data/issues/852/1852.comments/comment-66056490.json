The author of the package that you're trying to goinstall\n\ngoinstall launchpad.net/gorun\n\nis using Bazaar VCS to store/distribute program source.\n\ngoinstall is a very simple program and it doesn't implement any functions required to\nmanipulate source code repositories, instead it just executes correspondent vcs program\n(bzr.exe in your case) to perform required operations.\n\nSo, if you want to be able to \"goinstall\" launchpad.net/gorun package, you must install\nBazaar VCS. I haven't done it myself, so I don't know what else will break and can't\nguarantee it will work.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
