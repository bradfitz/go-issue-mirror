	"body": "Currently when you read a large file using ioutil.ReadAll the following bad things happen:\r\n1. ReadAll makes log(N) unnecessary allocations of total size N which become garbage.\r\n2. ReadAll makes an unnecessary copy of N bytes.\r\n3. ReadAll issues log(N) read requests (which is especially unpleasant for remote files).\r\n4. ReadAll can over-allocate up to 2x more memory than necessary.\r\n\r\nReadAll should support Seeker interface, query size of (the remaining part of) the file, and use it as capacity hint (which is already present in the implementation). That would eliminate all of the above negative effects (no garbage, no overallocation, no small reads).\r\n\r\nObjections?\r\n\r\n@bradfitz ",
