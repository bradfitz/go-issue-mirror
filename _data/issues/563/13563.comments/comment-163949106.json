	"body": "@danmux, this issue is about something that changed since 1.5. You may be seeing something in 1.5 different from 1.4 but it's not this. I'd still be interested to hear more about your problem if you'd like to file a new issue. If you can describe the condition you use to detect the issue that might be enough, but of course code is nicer. :-) Thanks.\r\n",
