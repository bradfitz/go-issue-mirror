They contain _all_ valid directory\nseparators, i.e. forward and backslash because they are used in path.Split. \n\nIn fact, I for one would recommend to use the forward slash as a path separator on\nWindows. If you call path.Glob with a pattern containing backslashes, such as `c:\\*.*`,\nthen the backslash is interpreted as an escape character, and \\* will match a literal\nasterisk, which is not what you want.\u003c/pre\u003e",
