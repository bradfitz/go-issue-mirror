	"body": "1. Using the latest committed version of `golang.org/x/mobile` (just `go get -u`'d it), and a `devel` version of Go.\r\n2. Compiling on `darwin/amd64` for `android/arm`.\r\n3. I was attempting to utilize `golang.org/x/mobile/app.Open()` in an net/http server response.\r\n4. I expected to get an open reference to the file or an error detailing why the file could not be opened.\r\n5. Instead, I get the following \"interesting\" error in `logcat`.\r\n\r\nLogs:\r\n\r\n    I/GoStdio (18461): GET /Index.html on app.melange.127.0.0.1.xip.io:7776 app\r\n    I/GoStdio (18461): Opening file client /Index.html\r\n    I/GoStdio (18461): About to App.Open\r\n    I/WindowState(  530): WIN DEATH: Window{1d53fd00 u0 com.getmelange.melange/com.getmelange.melange.MainActivity}\r\n    E/libprocessgroup(  530): failed to kill 1 processes for processgroup 18461\r\n    I/ActivityManager(  530): Process com.getmelange.melange (pid 18461) has died\r\n    W/ActivityManager(  530): Force removing ActivityRecord{2f5aeb91 u0 com.getmelange.melange/.MainActivity t279}: app died, no saved state\r\n    I/ActivityManager(  530): Activity reported stop, but no longer stopping: ActivityRecord{71ab226 u0 com.android.launcher/com.android.launcher2.Launcher t27}\r\n\r\n\r\nSearching around suggests that `WIN DEATH` is caused when the application stops responding. Through effective `fmt.Println()` debugging, I was able to determine that `app.Open()` does not return, but the `WIN DEATH` error is always triggered.\r\n\r\nNote that I'm running the application on a Nexus 7 running Lollipop.",
