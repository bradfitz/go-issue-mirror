	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.6.3 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n - Parse the AST for any program with any `if` statement\r\n - Walk the tree until you find an `*ast.IfStmt` node\r\n - Try to find the type of the expression via the `types.Info` struct you processed.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nAn entry of type types.Basic with kind bool.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nno entry in the map\r\n\r\n6. Extra\r\nThis is quite obviously not necessary as the types.Type of any ast.IfStmt.Cond is obviously types.Basic (with kind bool) but this complicates at least one piece of my code.\r\n\r\n",
