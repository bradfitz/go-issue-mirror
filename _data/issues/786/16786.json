	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.7 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nRead a several csv file, each one is about 50 m. the speed and memory usage are so huge.\r\n \r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nI compared regex with Java yesterday: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16758\r\nI wish Go can get the speed of Java\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nGo is much slower on CSV reading. I think writing also much slower too. So is there any way to optimize this? I read CSV like:\r\n```\r\nfunc (cd *CsvDecoder) readCsv(source []byte) (records [][]string, err error) {\r\n\tr := csv.NewReader(bytes.NewReader(source))\r\n\treturn r.ReadAll()\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMaybe I can set some options before reading? Seems I can't specify something like buffer size, etc. Why?\r\n",
