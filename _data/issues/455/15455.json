	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n1.6.2\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nI tested most of this on the play.golang.org site -- links are provided below. \r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when passing nil body to `(*http.Request).Post()` the code type switches on the various types it supports. However, it does not actually check for a straight nil (passing `io.Reader(nil)` works just fine) because the interface obscures it.\r\n\r\nThe second request here will panic.\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/kaLpNTYIEm\r\n\r\nThe issue is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://golang.org/src/net/http/request.go?s=19631:19703#L612\r\n\r\nAnd an example of (what I think is) an appropriate fix is here: https://play.golang.org/p/yaFaol2nyl\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nno panics :)\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\npanics.\r\n\r\nFinal notes: \u003c3. I'm sorry to pitch this over the fence, but I am really strapped for time.\r\n",
