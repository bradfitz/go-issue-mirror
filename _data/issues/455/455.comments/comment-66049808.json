The spec implies that variable X from import . \"./a\" should be\ndeclared in file scope (the spec does not say this explicitly, but it does say that\nimported package identifiers are declared at file scope).  Finally, the spec says \"no\nidentifier may be declared in both the file and package block\".\n\nI understand that the reference implementation does not behave as I describe.  A\nplausible resolution to this bug would be to change the spec.\u003c/pre\u003e",
