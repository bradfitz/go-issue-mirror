	"body": "If desired to use a custom `Dialer` as the inner, direct `Dialer` in the `proxy` package, for instance to use a `net.Dialer` with a configured timeout, it is not possible to use the convenience wrappers such as `DialerFromEnvironment` with a customized inner `Dialer`.\r\n\r\nPerhaps https://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/proxy/direct.go#L14 could be changed so that `Direct` is an instance of `type Dialer interface`, not a `type direct struct`, and consequently users could set it however they like?  Or, the dialers in `PerHost` (https://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/proxy/per_host.go#L15) could be exposed for modification after return from a function such as `ProxyFromEnvironment`.",
