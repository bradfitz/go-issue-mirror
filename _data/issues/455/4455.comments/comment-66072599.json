To use -u in 6g you have to first compile all the\nprerequisite libraries using -u, or else force them to be marked as safe by using the go\ntool pack S flag.\n\nSo if you did\n\nfor i in $(find $GOROOT/pkg -name '*.a'); do go tool pack rgS $i; done\n\nto mark all the standard library packages as safe, then you should be able to use 6g -u\nto compile your source file. Or you could use 6g -u to compile much (but not all) of the\nstandard library.\n\nOf course, not all the standard library packges are necesarily safe - syscall is not,\nfor example - so -u might not be getting you much in this case.\n\nReally -u is meant to be part of a larger system to restrict access to just a number of\nvetted packages/APIs and then whatever can be compiled safely. We haven't published any\nsuch system though.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
