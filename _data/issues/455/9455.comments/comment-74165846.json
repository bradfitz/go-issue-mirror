	"body": "These use cases are not strong enough to justify adding 128-bit types,\nwhich is a big task to emulate it on all targets.\n\n1. MD5 is not secure anymore, so there is little benefit adding types to\nstore its result.\n2. How often do you need to manipulate a UUID as a number rather than a\nbyte slice (or a string)?\n3. The other use cases can be done with math/big just as easy.\n\nAlso note that GCC doesn't support __int128 on 32-bit targets and Go do\nwant consistent language features across all supported architectures.\n",
