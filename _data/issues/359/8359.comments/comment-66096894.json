But that could be how we special case it internally with a private\ninterface.\n\nThe biggest question is how to handle the sync.Pool when the flate level can change.\n\nOne answer is to not use a sync.Pool for all flate.Writers which aren't level 5. That\nwill lead to bad performance when zipping lots of items (which is why we added the pool\nhere in the first place). Another item is having a sync.Pool per flate size. That seems\ncontroversial. I recommend you get an answer from Russ or Rob on that first before you\nstart doing any work on this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
