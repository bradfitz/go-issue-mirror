	"body": "My main motivation is to be able to have something that runs real quick and reports errors when a developer saves a file they're editing. Ideally it should also report errors on other files within the same project, say, if I rename a function that is used somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I started experimenting with -buildmode=archive is because in 1.5 builds became much slower; before 1.5, the hook was just doing a 'go test -c', which was fast enough in most cases.\r\n\r\nIf the check doesn't catch linking errors it's not a big deal, but yeah, it'd be nice if we could have 'go test -c' as fast as in pre-1.5 days",
