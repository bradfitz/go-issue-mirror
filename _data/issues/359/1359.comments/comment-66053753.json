If I get some bad input and\nwant to exit my program, I find it rather silly to have to flush the remainder of input\n(however long that may be?) before exiting.\n\nIn the way Go handles this, someone can write a program which seemingly does nothing\nharmful, however, using some clever tricks perhaps have a user do something detrimental?\nIt also seems rather unintuitive to pass the remainder of this input to the calling\nprogram?\n\nEither way, if you say this is the way it shall be, I will deal. Thanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
