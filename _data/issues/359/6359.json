	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI'd like to request the addition of the inverse error function (erfinv) and the\ncomplement, erfcinv to the math package to go along with erf and erfc. The inverse error\nfunction comes up most commonly in statistics (quantile of the normal distribution being\nthe prime example), though it makes frequent appearances elsewhere. It is not a function\nin cmath, but it is a function in the cuda math library (not to mention matlab, scipy\nand mathematica).\u003c/pre\u003e",
