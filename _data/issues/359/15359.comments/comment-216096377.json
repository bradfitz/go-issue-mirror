It still feels poor to me, and I don't fully understand ownership in the x/ tree, but if it's original-author's-call I suppose I don't really have anything else to say that I haven't already said to try and convince him.\r\n\r\nIf this were ever merged into the standard library I'd certainly want to bring this up again though; it doesn't feel like appropriate behavior to me (and still needs to be better documented).\r\n\r\nThanks for the discussion all.",
