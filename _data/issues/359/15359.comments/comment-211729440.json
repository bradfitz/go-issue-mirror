	"body": "\u003e There's a number of packages (including some in the standard library) that register HTTP interfaces by default\r\n\r\nA quick greap for `http.Handle(` and `http.HandleFunc(` only showed a few things, all under the `http/` tree. This feels a bit less suprising to me (though still not ideal) since they are in the same package.\r\n\r\n\u003e The default configuration of that package will only serve those interfaces to\r\nrequests coming from the same machine\r\n\r\nAh yes, I missed that; that's much _much_ better, but it still feels like this would be much better off being something that I as an API consumer have to enable explicitly. Anything that modifies my servers behavior, I probably want to know about. We don't know how users machines are set up, or how they're running their infrastructure, for all we know access to those methods from the same machine is still a problem (maybe there's sensative info in those logs that not all devs get access too and only ops can see? It's a contrived and vague example, but I think the point still stands).",
