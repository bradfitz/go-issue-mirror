At least it's very clearly documented in that case. I'll grant you that this does establish prescident, but just because something else was done this way before it doesn't make it a good idea or mean we should keep doing it this way in the future.\r\n\r\n\u003e If you're in a truly paranoid situation, you can always set up your own http.ServeMux\r\n\r\nYou could do that, but the point is that you have to *know* to do that and this violates the principal of least suprise. Most users won't expect a package to register http handlers just by being imported [citation needed].\r\n\r\nA small bit of setup in main (or wherever you're doing your HTTP setup) does not feel inconvenient to me, it feels explicit and readable; it makes it immediately obvious what's happening (whereas otherwise there is no indication from reading a snippet of code that these handlers are being registered).",
