Remember that you won't get any of this doing anything unless you call something like http.ListenAndServe.\r\n\r\nThe issue with having to enable it explicitly is that it's the kind of debugging endpoint you want to have present by default. It's annoying to have to load up your `func main()` with a whole lot of setup things, and if you're getting x/net/trace in your program it's because something is trying to expose information through it (e.g. grpc-go) presumably because that information is useful to be able to access.\r\n\r\nI think this is a massive convenience, and a pretty minor risk in practice.",
