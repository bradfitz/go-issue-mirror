	"body": "cmd/release used to be fast and only ran make.bash.\r\n\r\nNow it runs all.bash, which is slow.\r\n\r\nBut if all.bash already succeeded in the past there's no need to run the tests again. Maybe consult build.golang.org and ask if it already succeeded, and then switch to make.bash instead?\r\n\r\n/cc @broady ",
