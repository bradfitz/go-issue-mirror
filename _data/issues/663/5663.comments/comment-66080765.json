Don't second guess what people ask it to do.\n\nThe shell transcript you gave is no different than running make \u0026\u0026 make install as root\nin a non-Go program's installation. You end up with files owned by root. So don't do\nthat. \n\nIf the user tries\n\n$ cd /usr/local\n$ sudo tar xzf go.tar.gz\n$ export GOPATH=$HOME\n$ sudo go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/{cover,godoc,vet}\n\nthen I think they deserve what they get. We can't help people who don't understand how\nto be root. Why are they updating just those three programs? Why are those different\nfrom gofmt? I really don't understand the problem being solved here.\n\nI thought this bug was about telling people who build from source how to get those\nprograms, since they otherwise would not. \n\nAnd in that case I think the answer is you run the 'go get -u\ncode.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/cover' and then again for godoc and vet (cannot use { }\nsyntax because it doesn't work in all shells, notably Windows).\u003c/pre\u003e",
