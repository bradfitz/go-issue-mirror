	"body": "Looking at https://tip.golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Generate_Go_files_by_processing_source right now:\r\n\r\n\u003e Usage:\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e go generate [-run regexp] [file.go... | packages]\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\r\nHowever, at the bottom it mentions:\r\n\r\n\u003e It also accepts the standard build flags -v, -n, and -x. The -v flag prints the names of packages and files as they are processed. The -n flag prints commands that would be executed. The -x flag prints commands as they are executed.\r\n\r\nThe usage line should be updated to mention those additional flags:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-go generate [-run regexp] [file.go... | packages]\r\n+go generate [-v] [-n] [-x] [-run regexp] [file.go... | packages]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther commands have their usage complete and do not skip -n and -x flags that are available, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo clean [-i] [-r] [-n] [-x] [build flags] [packages]\r\ngo fmt [-n] [-x] [packages]\r\ngo tool [-n] command [args...]\r\ngo vet [-n] [-x] [build flags] [packages]\r\ngo get [-d] [-f] [-fix] [-insecure] [-t] [-u] [build flags] [packages]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems -v is never included even if available, so maybe it's most consistent to do:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo generate [-n] [-x] [-run regexp] [file.go... | packages]\r\n```",
