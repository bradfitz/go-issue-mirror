The concept of popping things out of a\nhash map like is being done is inherently flawed.  It's\nhand-picking hashes on one end of the bucket one by one,\nand thus killing the basic balance property of a hash map.\n\nIt'd be nice to fix the problem in a way that avoids the more\nfundamental problem, rather than just working on the edge case.\u003c/pre\u003e",
