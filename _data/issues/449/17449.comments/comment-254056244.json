Assuming pwd is `/src/`, compile with:\r\n  1. **Inlining enabled and race detection disabled**: No issues, compiles just fine.\r\n\r\n    ```shell\r\n    $ ./../pkg/tool/linux_amd64/compile ~/tmp/race/race.go\r\n    ```\r\n  2. **Inlining and race detection both enabled**: Fails to compile. Notice \".i4\" is repeated in dumped code.\r\n\r\n    ```shell\r\n    $ ./../pkg/tool/linux_amd64/compile -race ~/tmp/race/race.go\r\n    ```\r\n  3. **Inlining disabled and race detection enabled**: Compiles just fine.\r\n    \r\n   ```shell\r\n    $ ./../pkg/tool/linux_amd64/compile -race -l ~/tmp/race/race.go\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nI also dumped the function [before and after race instrumentation](https://github.com/dhananjay92/go/commit/98b22bc14105e1c3f0e01c64d3eb7610004fbf38). Side by side diff of generated codes is at https://www.diffchecker.com/68vuYuaq. Notice that label (and corresponding GOTO statement) `.i4` is repeated in right side. (In master, inline-labels are of format `.iX`, where X is some number.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking into how to prevent this.",
