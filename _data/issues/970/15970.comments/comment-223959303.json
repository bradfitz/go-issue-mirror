I don't have access to a Windows right now, but \"handles\" may have an arbitrary numbering that make Windows unaffected. If so, os.Stderr.Close() and panic() lose their consistency between Windows and UNIX. \r\n\r\nAnother question I don't know the answer to is whether this potentiates \"stderr closers\" to some information disclosure on the condition that a remote party can influence what becomes fd 2 and is able to trigger panics or other low-level printing routines to transmit data back to them through the fd. It seems far-fetched but worth noting.\r\n\r\n",
