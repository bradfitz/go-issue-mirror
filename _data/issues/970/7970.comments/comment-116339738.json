	"body": "I'm not really sure which languages permit concurrent read/close access in any way.  I think for most languages it is undefined behavior.  For kernel file descriptors it is permitted, but of course the same race is possible.\r\n\r\nIn the net package we handle the same problem with the code in net/fd_mutex.go.  As far as I can see the same approach would work in the os package.  This would mean extending the problem of errClosing (#4373) to the os package.\r\n\r\nThe fix for issue #6817 probably requires some set of helper threads for I/O.  AIO is not really possible on GNU/Linux systems.  There is no separate supported kernel interface for it; the aio_read functions and friends are implemented by simply using a thread pool for I/O.",
