	"body": "Continuing my Dup comment from above, @aclements points out taht we can avoid losing the error from syscall.Close by doing:\r\n\r\n    newfd := syscall.Dup(fd)\r\n    syscall.Dup2(badfd, fd)\r\n    err := syscall.Close(newfd)\r\n    ... close fd (now equivalent to badfd) once ref count drops to 0 ...\r\n\r\nOf course, this would mean that if you run out of file descriptors, it becomes impossible to close a file. We could do this only for fd's with pending operations, of course, but then there's a little-exercised code path lurking.\r\n\r\nThis seems extremely low priority. Going to move to Unplanned until that changes.",
