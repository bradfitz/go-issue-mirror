	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\nA good example is this:  \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/3bwbg8LLGE\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/3bwbg8LLGE\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nThe encoding according to the RFC is as follows:\n\n      basic-credentials = base64-user-pass\n      base64-user-pass  = \u0026lt;base64 [4] encoding of user-pass,\n                       except not limited to 76 char/line\u0026gt;\n      user-pass   = userid \u0026quot;:\u0026quot; password\n      userid      = *\u0026lt;TEXT excluding \u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n      password    = *TEXT\n\nIn particular, you do not encode the username and password, just split on ':' -- the\nonly special bit is that the username isn't allowed to have a : itself.\n\nThen the entire thing is base64 encoded.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nURL escaped stuff.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nOSX/Linux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\n1.1.1\u003c/pre\u003e",
