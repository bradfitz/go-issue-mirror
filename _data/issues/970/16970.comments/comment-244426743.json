So your build is definitely broken, and the fix is easy: use /usr/bin/clang not clang as the C compiler.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to support \"every possible compiler configuration\". You just need to call the xcode supplied one. Its not enough to say as the docs do, that xcode must be installed. Obviously because it didn't work for me. Note, I did not modify anything supplied by xcode.\r\n\r\nIt may be, at some stage, I understand enough go and enough about building it that I will indeed \"know what I'm doing\" but most people get errors like this on their very first build attempt, as I did.",
