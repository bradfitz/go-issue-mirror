We prevent sigprof from tracing the user stack if it's currently being copied, but we don't interlock the other way around: if sigprof starts tracing the user stack first, it's possible for another thread to come along and shrink it while sigprof is still tracing.\r\n\r\nSo, in fact bbd1a1c is only a partial fix to #12932. (/cc @DanielMorsing)\r\n\r\nIt's possible this could be causing #12528 as well, but I haven't worked out an exact sequence of events for that yet.",
