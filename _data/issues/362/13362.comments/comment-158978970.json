	"body": "I've reproduced this several times now and it's clear that it's always a SIGPROF that came in during the systemstack(gcMark) in gcMarkTermination called from a mutator assist. Given where it found a barrier versus where it expects them, I'd say the stack was shrunk. However, we don't allow sigprof to walk the user stack when it's in _Gcopystack (and the traceback doesn't say that the user goroutine is in _Gcopystack), so we must have *finished* shrinking the stack, but not yet returned to the new stack. But in this case, we should have adjusted all of the barriers as well as sched.sp (which gentraceback uses to find the user stack), so I'm not sure how this inconsistency is arising.",
