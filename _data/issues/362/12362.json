	"body": "It would be useful to be able to encode struct { FileName string; Content []byte } values, but this is currently impossible with encoding/binary.\r\n\r\nThe package can encode []byte values but not strings.  This seems rather arbitrary.  Supporting strings, with the same encoding as []byte(s), would save making an often-large copy in many cases.\r\n\r\nThe encoding/binary package can also encode structs whose fields are scalar numbers, but not structs whose fields are []byte slices.  Is there any particular reason for this?  It doesn't seem like it would be hard to change.\r\n",
