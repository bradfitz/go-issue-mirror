(Or did I miss someone doing that?)\r\n\r\nminux is right, the moves generated here are sometimes used to marshal arguments to a function, so we can't call a function to do the marshaling.  For other situations like your a=b example you could call memmove.  It might take some work to distinguish those two cases, however.  At the move generation point the marshaling has already been turned into a=b assignments.",
