There's\nno need for a request to make a claim on the connection beyond the claim made by the\nround trip.\n\nStreaming APIs like Twitter's are a use case for HeaderTimeout and InactivityTimeout.\nWith these APIs, the client receives a stream of data and keep-alive messages in the\nresponse. The header timeout detects problems connecting to the server. The inactivity\ntimeout detects the case where the client is not receiving data or keep-alive messages.\n\nThe read deadline can be set via the Transport Dial function, but not in ways that the\napplication might want.  For example, it's not possible to implement ResponseTimeout\nwhen a connection is reused.\u003c/pre\u003e",
