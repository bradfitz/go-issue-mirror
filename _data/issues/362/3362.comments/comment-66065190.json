The timeout method used by\ngithub.com/mreiferson/go-httpclient is now pretty slick, but it definitely not obvious\nfor most how that would been implemented (took a couple iterations in that library\nitself). We could better promote helper libs like this, but people are always going to\nmiss out on them. \n\nI also still would like to see a actual Timeout error returned instead of the closed\nconnection error, but I think the proper reference implementation is still more\nimportant.\u003c/pre\u003e",
