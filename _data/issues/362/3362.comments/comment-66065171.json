I think we now have all the\nnecessary low-level mechanisms to let Go programs implement their own policies, without\nadding dozens of new knobs.\n\nIf anybody wants to argue for things we should have for Go 1.1 (either low-level\nmechanisms or higher-level knobs), speak now.  The cut-off date is approaching.\u003c/pre\u003e",
