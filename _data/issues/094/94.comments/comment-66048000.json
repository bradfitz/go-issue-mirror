There's no problem with it.\n\nI have no idea why the process is getting SIGKILLed, but it's something to do with \nyour system. (Maybe `dmesg` would give a hint).\n\nIt's great that 386 is working for you, although I would expect a different error if \nyou were running a binary for the wrong platform. Note that the type of CPU doesn't \ndetermine if you're running a 64-bit system. You need a 64-bit capable CPU (which you \nhave), but you also need a 64-bit distribution. (And that's not clear.)\n\nIf you run `ldd /bin/ls` and look at the size of the library offsets, that should \ngive you an idea. Here's the first line from a 64-bit system:\n\n% ldd /bin/ls\n        linux-vdso.so.1 =\u003e  (0x00007fff6f3b3000)\n\nOn a 32-bit system, the address (the numbers after \"0x\") would be half as long.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
