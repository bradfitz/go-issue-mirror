For android, you need to install the SDK+NDK+Go cross compiler.\r\n\r\nWhat we have right now for Mac and Linux lets you download the stock Go build, write a 15-line app and type go build. Compile+test cycles are dramatically faster than working on the real device, and the whole experience is a lot more fun. I'd like to bring that to windows users. I'm sure we can, there's just work to do.",
