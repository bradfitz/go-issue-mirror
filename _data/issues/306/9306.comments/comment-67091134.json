Some C libs might be configured to be built as DLLs. Then you have to ship these DLLs as part of your app. Some C libs might rely on external libs (DLLs) (for example Microsoft C runtime or similar). Then again you have to distribute these along with your app.\r\n\r\nMind you, you could, probably, create DLL file in /tmp on the fly and load it on your app startup. I have never tried that, but I don't see why it won't work. Maybe anti-virus might complain ...\r\n\r\nI am also not sure why you want to run mobile app natively on Windows desktop. I think it would be nuch more useful to be able to launch mobile app inside of some emulator that runs on Windows desktop. The emulator that creates environment that looks as close as possible to real device. Or just launch mobile app on real device.\r\n\r\nAlex",
