	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.6.0\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nOS X and Linux (but it affects any of them)\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nnet/http2 errors when adding a connection-specific header to client requests. \r\n\r\nFor example, adding a Keep-Alive header to an HTTP request (as the Google [certificate-transparency client does](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency/blob/39dd3f13a37a935a8a5be5e8a4248422c9facd08/go/client/logclient.go#L127)) and have it go over an HTTP/2 connection.\r\n\r\nPer [Section 8.1.2.2 of the HTTP/2 spec](https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#rfc.section.8.1.2.2), connection-specific headers are to be dropped by HTTP/2 clients.\r\n\r\nSee this sample code that talks to www.google.com: http://play.golang.org/p/W2C9LfLBlO\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nA working GET request to an HTTP/2 server that returns a 200\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nA 400 Bad Request response from the HTTP/2 server.\r\n\r\nThis was discovered in https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency/issues/1136",
