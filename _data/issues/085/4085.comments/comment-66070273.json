In general we want programs that are valid according to spec to compile\nindependent of platform.\n\nOne could say that negative constant arguments lead to a compile-time error (those could\nalways be caught), but those are actually leading to a run-time error with the gc\ncompiler. And one could say that positive constants that don't fit into an int64 lead to\nan error as well. It seems though that the gain (catching rather rare bugs that\npredictably cause a panic if that code is executed at all) is not worth the pain (extra\ncomplexity in the spec for something that in general needs a runtime check anyway).\u003c/pre\u003e",
