Note that the spec before _always_ required a run-time panic; so this\nchange is actually improving the situation from before (where make([]int, -1) also\nrequired a run-time panic).\n\nIn general, a good compiler can point out many more errors, but we don't want to\nhardwire this in the spec. Perhaps it makes sense to have an \"implementation\nrestriction\" to point out \"stupid makes\". For instance, gc complains about \"stupid\nshifts\" if the shift count reaches a threshold.\u003c/pre\u003e",
