	"body": "As part of the rewrite of the coordinator and building subrepos (#8646 and #9506), we also want the coordinator to use N VMs to do an all.{bash,bat,rc} instead of 1, and then shard test execution over a bunch of VMs, to speed things up.\r\n\r\nFirst step is to rewrite the bottom half of all.bash into Go and ditch the three variants (bash, bat, rc).\r\n\r\n/cc @adg\r\n",
