And what looks like an exports table that may not be\nalphabetized. My hunch is that a sort occurs on the function list between the time the\ninternal and external pointers are generated.\n\nWhich explains why I have to sort them by hand in my source file.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4029/2/dlbug_fail.go\"\u003edlbug_fail.go\u003c/a\u003e (1371 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4029/2/dlbug_pass.go\"\u003edlbug_pass.go\u003c/a\u003e (1371 bytes)",
