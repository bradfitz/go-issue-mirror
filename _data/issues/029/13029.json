	"body": "[OpenBSD 5.8](http://www.openbsd.org/58.html) was released on Oct 18, 2015, which means OpenBSD 5.6 is no longer supported upstream.  We should upgrade the builder images to 5.7.  (I'm assuming we prefer to continue testing on the oldest supported version.)\r\n\r\nCC @bradfitz @adg @4a6f656c",
