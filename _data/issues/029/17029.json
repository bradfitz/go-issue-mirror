	"body": "When we generate algs, we name them after the types they operate on. However, all that matters to the alg is the structure of the type. Equality and hashing is the same for `struct { A [2]int64}` and `struct { B [2]int64 }`. I took an initial stab at this in [CL 19842](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/19842/) but it didn't properly handle pointers vs scalars. The CL suggested a possible binary size improvement of ~1%. This issue is a reminder to try again, probably after some alg-related cleanup.\r\n\r\ncc @cherrymui \r\n",
