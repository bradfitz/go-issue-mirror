They're alive and restart when we push new binaries to GCS, but we can't ssh to them anymore. Because at least one of those machines was responsible for the failures recently, I wanted to reproduce there or check their timezones.\r\n\r\nThis is frustrating.\r\n\r\nI think I'll just disable test sharding on OS X for now.",
