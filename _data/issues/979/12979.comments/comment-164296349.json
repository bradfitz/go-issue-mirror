	"body": "Are we sure this is related to the builders and not generally to Darwin? For example, part of determining staleness is comparing mtimes, and HFS+ mtimes have only 1 second resolution. When you disabled sharding, the runtime didn't import any packages, so all that mattered was how the source mtimes compared with the runtime.a mtime and the sources were unpacked well before the runtime was built. Now, however, the runtime imports two internal packages that were probably built a fraction of a second before the runtime itself. They could easily have equal mtimes on HFS+, though that won't cause staleness. However, if mtimes went slightly backwards (NFS adjustment?), it could trigger this.",
