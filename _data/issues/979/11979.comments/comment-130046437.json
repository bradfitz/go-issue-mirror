The win is on the sweeping side.\r\n\r\nThere's even some literature on this approach, it turns out. \"Effective Prefetch for Mark-Sweep Garbage Collection\" by Garner, 2007 uses exactly this trick. Plus, I think this will be necessary if we want to move to sweep-free allocation because finding and freeing unmarked spans is one of the tasks of the sweeper that's hard to do efficiently otherwise.",
