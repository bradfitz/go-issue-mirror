My system had run out of swap space (4GB RAM + 1GB swap)!\nIt killed one of the invocations of 6g, but I don't know any way to tell what process it\nwas that was hogging that much memory. Now, with three of the run.go jobs still running,\nI have 2GB free. So I suspect that it was another one of the transient errors that we're\nchasing.\n\nBesides the OOM, the messages I got so far from the test runs were:\nrun fixedbugs/bug207.go : wait : bad address\n\nand\n\nrunoutput rotate0.go : incorrect output\u003c/pre\u003e",
