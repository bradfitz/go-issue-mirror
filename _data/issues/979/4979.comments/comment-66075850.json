I have the program\nrunning on 3 machines: linux/amd64, linux/386, and freebsd/amd64. The linux/386 one\nisn't crashing, the linux/amd64 one crashes maybe once a week, and the freebsd/amd64 one\ncrashes about twice a day. The linux/amd64 one handles quite a bit more traffic than the\nFreeBSD one.\u003c/pre\u003e",
