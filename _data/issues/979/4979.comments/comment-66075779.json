I tested Go versions dating back to\nNovember, and still got the crashes. But when I updated my FreeBSD base system to the\ntip of the 9-STABLE branch, the crashes seem to have gone away. I've been crash-free for\ntwo days now.\n\nFrom when the crashes started, I suspect the problem was in the ZFS module; they started\nshortly after I added a ZFS disk to my system. Why a ZFS problem would crash a process\nthat wasn't even accessing a ZFS disk, I don't know; but it looks pretty suspicious.\u003c/pre\u003e",
