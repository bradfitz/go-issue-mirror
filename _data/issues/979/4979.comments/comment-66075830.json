Most of the time, I'm only running one computer\nthrough it, so having a heavy load on the redwood-filter process itself is not\nnecessary, although putting a heavy load in the server as a whole seems to make the\ncrashes more likely.\n\nBy the way, I just ran memtest on my server for a few hours. I didn't find any errors,\nso that tends to confirm that this isn't a hardware problem.\u003c/pre\u003e",
