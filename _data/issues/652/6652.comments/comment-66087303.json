The confusion is between\n\"types\", \"typed constants\" and untyped flavors of constants. With your clarifications,\nit seems to me that the spec is consistent. \n\nLooking more closely, I see that the term \"Integer constant\" is sort of defined in the\n\"Integer literals\" section:\n\"An integer literal is a sequence of digits representing an integer constant.\"\n\nPerhaps I still don't fully understand, but Isn't this sort of backwards? An integer\nliteral is a sequence of digits as defined by the EBNF notation. An integer constant is\na constant value represented by an integer literal. \n\nI think the spec would be more clear with a sentence along the lines of \"A constant\ncreated with an integer literal is an untyped integer constant,  similarly a constant\ncreated with a rune is an untyped rune constant, etc.\". As it stands, the use of the\nterm \"integer constant\" is displaced from where it's used.\u003c/pre\u003e",
