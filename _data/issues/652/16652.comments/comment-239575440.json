	"body": "MySql does a lot of implicit conversions https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/type-conversion.html though knowing the type upfront could allow you to work around that, if you knew that might get you in trouble and you knew you were dealing with MySql.\r\n\r\n\u003e Are you disagreeing that there are only so many distinct types or that there are many others then listed\r\n\r\nBoth. There are databases with fewer types. There are databases with more types. (Many with infinite types in the sense that you can define arbitrary composite types like arrays and records).\r\n\r\nI'm also trying to point out that just because two types have the same name in two different databases it doesn't mean they behave the same or that all the same rules apply.\r\n\r\nNone of that is to say that the type information isn't useful: just that it's very dependent on what database you're using.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking something like\r\n```\r\n//in driver package\r\ntype Type interface {\r\n    fmt.Stringer\r\n    ValueConverter\r\n\r\n    Equal(Type) bool\r\n    AssignableTo(Type) bool\r\n   //and so on\r\n}\r\n```\r\nis going to be more useful since it can handle a lot of those database-specific nuances for you. An sqlite driver could just always return true for AssignableTo and a postgres driver could return false if Equal returns false (after checking a handful of special cases surrounding text types, iirc).",
