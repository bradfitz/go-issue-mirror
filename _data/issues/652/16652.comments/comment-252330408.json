	"body": "@kardianos I'm coming around to your approach due to your very valid point about future extensibility (which wasn't a design consideration for me in my own hack).\r\n\r\nAlso, it's probably the case that my point about the amount of calls to the driver to construct the `sql.ColumnType` object is a bit of a red herring. In practice for most applications I imagine that `sql.Rows.ColumnTypes()` will likely only be invoked once per unique query, and the details of how that function is implemented will only have negligible overall impact on performance. I'll give it some more thought this weekend, but given that the key thing here is the API design for the `sql` package (as opposed to the `driver` package changes), I don't want to hold up the overall proposal. Thanks for taking the time to get back to me.",
