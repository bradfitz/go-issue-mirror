I added the old interface to except.txt but I'm not sure if that's such a good idea? Some help from more experienced contributors would be awesome.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** I'm only doing this to start playing around and getting familiar with the source. I don't feel like we've reached a consensus as to what should be done.",
