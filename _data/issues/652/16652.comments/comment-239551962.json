Postgres let's you define your own types. SQLite doesn't really care if you use the right type. Postgres does. Some of their types share some names but that's about it: they behave quite differently.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what methods it should have (other than String() string) though. Stuff to work with other types and values, presumably.",
