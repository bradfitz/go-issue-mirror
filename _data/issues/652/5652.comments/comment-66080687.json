(how did that happen?)\n\nI've added a bookmark in Firefox with the keyword \"pkg\" which navigates to\n\"\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/%s\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/pkg/%s\u003c/a\u003e\".\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://s21.postimg.org/moyc3urmt/keyword.png\"\u003ehttp://s21.postimg.org/moyc3urmt/keyword.png\u003c/a\u003e\n\nA simple example that would trigger this behavior is typing \"pkg encoding/\" into the\nnavigation bar which Firefox would translate into \"\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/encoding%2F\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/pkg/encoding%2F\u003c/a\u003e\".\n\nA more common example would be using different variations of github.com or\ncode.google.com repositories were you would want to view all packages of a specific user\nor all packages contained within a specific repository. (This is when running godoc\nlocally of cause).\n\nWhile it is possible to teach yourself not to add a trailing \"/\" at the end of such\nrequests, I do think this should be resolved in godoc and not at the client.\u003c/pre\u003e",
