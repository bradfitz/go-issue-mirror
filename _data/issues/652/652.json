	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIf one goroutine is blocking on net.Listener.Accept(), but should be shut down, the\n\u0026quot;correct\u0026quot; way \nto unblock it seems to be for another goroutine to close the Listener (see Comment #6,\nissue \n240).  However, this causes a segfault.\n\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nCompile and run the attached listener_crash.go\n\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\nI expect to see a reasonable error, instead I see a segfault and backtrace.\n\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n\nGOOS=linux\nGOARCH=amd64\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\n0b7cedc4de63+ tip\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\n(By the way, when I to upgrade to this hg revision, I had to hack the regex package,\nbecause it \nbroke the build).  I'm sure someone else has found this out already :)\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/652/0/listener_crash.go\"\u003elistener_crash.go\u003c/a\u003e (560 bytes)",
