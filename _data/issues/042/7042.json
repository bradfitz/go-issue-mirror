Put three pem certs together in a file, but put the second one's BEGIN line on the\nsame line as the first one's end\n2. Load with LoadX509KeyPair or X509KeyPair.\n3. See 2 certificates loaded (the first and the last) but the second one is silently\nskipped\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nError when the file doesn't parse.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nLoads the first and third certs with no acknowledgment of the second one.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nThis occurs on OS X and Linux\n\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.2 darwin/amd64\n\n`openssl x509` manages to error out both in this case and when the certs are broken up\nincorrectly and the trailing dashes on the first is less by one than expected and the\nleading dashes on the second is greater by one than expected.\u003c/pre\u003e",
