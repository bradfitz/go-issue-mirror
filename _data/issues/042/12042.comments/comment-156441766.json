We can put it somewhere better outside of experimental when it's code reviewed and we decide on a name and location. (which might prove more difficult than writing the tool)\r\n\r\nI don't know what it takes to close this bug. I doubt we'll be able to auto-run the tool regularly, given its dependence on Google's internal CLA service.\r\n\r\nWe can at least run this again right before Go 1.6 is released.\r\n",
