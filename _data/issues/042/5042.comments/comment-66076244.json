None of my environment variables have\nquotes around them, some of them are paths with space in it.\n\nPutting quotes around GOROOT environment variable is not needed - it achieves nothing. I\nthink it is a user mistake. I would keep things simple and do nothing.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be nice, and try and support this case, then, I think, the\nchange should be done in runtime.GOROOT, not in cmd/go. Just to be consistent. But, I am\nconcerned to introduce \"unquoted\" runtime.GOROOT that will not equal to\nos.Getenv(\"GOROOT\"). Also what are the rules of GOPATH \"unquoting\"? Should we follow\nfilepath.SplitPath? But it is not documented anywhere.\n\nJust makes everything complicated.\n\nPerhaps, we could just os.Stat(runtime.GOROOT) at cmd/go start, and fail with\nappropriate message.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
