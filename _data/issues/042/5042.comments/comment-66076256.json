Such a path can even be used by most system APIs to do\nthings. You just cannot concatenate it into the middle of a longer path with the space\nstill attached. Ditto with the quotes.   \n\nChecking if the directory exists would be hugely helpful not just on Windows but also on\nLinux and OSX. There is never a situation where invalid environmental variables won't\ncause go to fail and fail in rather obscure ways.    \n\nPlus you won't even have to handle every single edge case... Just one case - \"is this\npath valid? Yes|No\" and almost every OS has functionality to check that for you.\u003c/pre\u003e",
