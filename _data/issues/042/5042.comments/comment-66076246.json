If you put whitespace\nafter the GOROOT path with or without quotes it will blindly put that into GOTOOLDIR\ne.g. \n\nREM The below line has an extra space at the end   \nset GOTOOLDIR=C:\\go \n\nThen if we run \"go env\":   \nset GOTOOLDIR=C:\\go \\pkg\\tool\\windows_386\n\nSo seems like the problem is \"larger\" than just quotation marks. We aren't even trimming\nGOROOT.   \n\nNow I would accept that ALL of these are the user's fault. But the way BAT is designed\nit makes these kind of mistakes fairly easy to do and fairly hard to detect once they're\ndone.    \n\nI mean even if we ignore the quote issue (edge case?) then it is hard to ignore the\nwhitespace issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
