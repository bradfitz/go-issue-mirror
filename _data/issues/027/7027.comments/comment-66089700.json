And thus, I\nwould kindly ask to at least insert some temporary \"print(WARNING_TAG)\" in some code\nuniquely triggered for this behavior, and then build Go (ideally for all platforms) and\nverify that there are no cases when WARNING_TAG gets printed. And if there are, then\nreview these parts of code in light of this behavior. And actually, it might still be a\ngood idea to leave this WARNING_TAG in code permanently, based on the non-obviousness.\u003c/pre\u003e",
