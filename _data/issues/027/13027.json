	"body": "`Slice` is a powerful and commonly used data structure in Go to organize multiple items in a sequence, but there are cases where `List` is a better choice. One such case could be where the number of items is large and arbitrary items are inserted one by one while maintaining certain sort order. Insertion or deletion at arbitrary places in a Slice would cause relocation of the trailing items.\r\n\r\nFor this reason if one chooses to use `List` over `Slice`, it comes with a cost of not being able to use `Range` iterator syntax. Consequently, the `List` is not supported by the template iterator system (`{{range pipeline}}`) either.\r\n\r\nHence, I am proposing the addition of `Range` iterator support for `List` data structure.",
