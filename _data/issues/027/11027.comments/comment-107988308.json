	"body": "\u003e I tried running with GODEBUG=efence=1, but my program crashes with \"fatal error: out of memory (stackalloc)\" every minute or so and I haven't seen it crash with any other errors of interest (it crashed once with #11023). Is the memory exhaustion expected even on amd64?\r\n\r\nThat's a little surprising, but efence does change memory allocation patterns fairly substantially.\r\n\r\n\u003e I'll see what I can do on a reduced test case.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
