	"body": "Depending on how text templates decide how to iterate (i.e., whether they look at the actual type and/or whether there's an \"iterator\" channel present), this may require as little as adding a method returning a channel yielding the list elements to container/list.\r\n\r\nIf that's the only required change, I might not mind.\r\n\r\nBut I suspect it might be more involved. And in that case I'm with @adg: I don't think this is warranted. The container/list is in the std/lib mostly for historic reasons, and is almost always overkill and slower than any other solution. Adding a channel on top of it to simplify iterations will only make things worse.\r\n\r\n@ibnesayeed your latest suggestions at extending the range clause is out of the question for Go 1.0.\r\n",
