The point I was trying to make is, sometimes, how much something is used depends on how well that is supported. Take an example of a language that has excellent support of arrays, but very poor and basic support of dictionaries. Programmers of that language will often prefer using combinations of array tricks to achieve more than what they can by the native implementation of the dictionary. On that ground, saying that dictionary is a rarely used data structure is true, but not true.\r\n\r\nAlmost all data structure books talk about arrays and linked lists together on the same fundamental data structure level. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. However, I do agree that array is a more commonly used data structure in real life applications than linked list, but if it is supported as first class data structure by the language and gets the same degree of love, then the usage will not be rare.\r\n\r\nI think the point of this proposal is to make the `range` clause more generic that iterates over any collection that satisfies certain conditions. List being just one example of such a collection that can leverage this extension.",
