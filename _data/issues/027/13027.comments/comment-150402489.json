	"body": "\u003e It's rare that people use container/list. Most programmers opt for just using slices instead.\r\n\r\nThere are cases where linked list is a better and more efficient choice than slices. Calling it rare is more like introducing something half-baked in the language core packages and then removing it later saying it was not well received. If my use case is not very specific where I must use certain data type, I would probably switch to something less efficient but more convenient.\r\n\r\n\u003e I think the combination of container/list and templates is an order of magnitude rarer.\r\n\r\nIt is not about supporting the template, it is about supporting the range iterator, template will follow that automatically (I guess).\r\n\r\n\u003e It doesn't seem like something worth creating a special-case for.\r\n\r\nIt's more along the lines of generalization of the iterator, not specialization.",
