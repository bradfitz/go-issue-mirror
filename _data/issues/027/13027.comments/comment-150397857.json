I think the template system will automatically start supporting it (unless there is hardcoded restriction to certain data structures) if the required iterator functionality is added to the List implementation.\r\n\r\nI am not much aware of the Go internals as I am new to this language, but I am thinking along the lines of how Sorting functionality is added to any arbitrary struct by attaching the necessary interface to it.",
