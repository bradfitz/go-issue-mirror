	"body": "Looking at the specs, I think it will require changes in the language, not just in the package implementation. Here is what the [RangeClause](https://golang.org/ref/spec#RangeClause) grammar says:\r\n\r\n\u003e The expression on the right in the \"range\" clause is called the range expression, which may be an array, pointer to an array, slice, string, map, or channel permitting receive operations.\r\n\r\nHowever, this explicit list of white-listed data types/structures is limiting. In my opinion, the range clause should have certain set of conditions, that, if fulfilled by any data structure, should be supported as an iterator. Those conditions could be something like this:\r\n\r\n* must have a definite start and an end\r\n* must provide a guaranteed traversal path from the start to the end\r\n* must provide a well known way of transitioning from one node to the next",
