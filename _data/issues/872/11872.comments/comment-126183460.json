	"body": "Thanks for the confirmation. The root cause comes from the current corner-cutting socktest package implementation. It tries to track socket calls with socket descriptor numbers as a key for testing, and has no care about \"quick socket descriptor number recycling\" for simplicity. Therefore it may confuse socket descriptors in a situation like the following:\r\n```\r\nG1  CALL socket\r\nG1  RET socket = 3\r\nG1  socktest.register(3)\r\nG1  CALL close(3)\r\nG2  CALL socket\r\nG2  RET socket = 3\r\nG2  socktest.register(3) // eviction\r\nG1  RET close\r\nG1  socktest.unregister(3) // eviction\r\nG2  CALL connect(3, ...)\r\nG2  socktest.connect(3, ...) // socktest.switch redirects the call to syscall and results \"dial tcp 127.0.0.1:0 getsockopt: connection refused\" error\r\n```\r\nThis may happen in selfConnect, in the case of TCP simultaneous open, and Linux is one of the platforms that can make TCP simultaneous open happen easily.",
