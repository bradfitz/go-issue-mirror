	"body": "Those mallocs you see are only for allocating maps.  All the slices require no allocations.  So this is a duplicate of #2559.  I don't see any way to easily fix this, as statically allocated maps would have to be different somehow (at least in their hash function).\r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed is that growings are happening during the initialization.  I've opened a separate bug #15880 for that. It should eliminate a good chunk of the startup allocations you're seeing.",
