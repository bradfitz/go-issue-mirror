And then please look at what exactly tests\nbecome slower.\n\nRuntime contains either synthetic tests or exotic corner cases. With high probability it\ndoes not affect real programs.\n\nHowever, we can't get too far performance-wise without a performance bot... I will send\na separate email to golang-dev.\u003c/pre\u003e",
