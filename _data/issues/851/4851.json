Run `go build -o /dev/null` in a main package that lives in GOPATH\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nNo output, but the resulting binary should be discarded\n\nWhat do you see instead?\ngo install foo: build output \u0026quot;/dev/null\u0026quot; already exists and is not an object\nfile\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux 3.2.1-gentoo-r2\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version devel +e93de8482d59 Mon Feb 18 19:03:10 2013 -0800 linux/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nWhen compiling a package that lives in GOPATH, go build will eventually call copyFile,\nwhich checks that the output file is neither a directory nor a non-object file, to\nprevent accidentally overwriting the wrong file. \n\nIt would be useful if -o /dev/null would work, to discard the binary.\u003c/pre\u003e",
