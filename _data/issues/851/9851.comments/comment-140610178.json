The linked MySQL docs for wait_timeout say:\r\n\r\n\u003eThe number of seconds the server waits for activity on a noninteractive connection before closing it.\r\n\r\nThe docs for the [MySQL server has gone away error](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/gone-away.html) use similar language.\r\n\r\n\u003eBy default, the server closes the connection after eight hours if nothing has happened.\r\n\r\nPerhaps not authoritative, but certainly more explicit, [this MySQL DBA's blog](http://www.mysqldba.co.uk/articles/let-sleeping-dogs-die-automatically-close-idle-connections) says (near the bottom):\r\n\r\n\u003eThe timeout is reset each time a query is run...\r\n\r\nAll of the evidence I can find indicates that MySQL closes connections that have not run a query for a number of seconds. I can find no evidence that the timeout is measured from when the connection was created as the initial feature request and CL 6580 describe.",
