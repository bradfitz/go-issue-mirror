This is a long-standing issue.\r\nIt seems there is a race condition that leads some file descriptors to be closed twice.\r\n\r\nA simple workaround is to ignore the error returned by the close syscall.\r\nThis should be safe since we just want to be sure the fd was closed.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, it would be better to fix the race.",
