I'm sure there are others \r\n\r\nSeems like it would be better just to drop support for the -compiler option.\r\n\r\nIf that was done then copies of the go tools for alternate compilers could be provided with distinct names, something like go.gccgo and go.llgo so it was clear which ones were being used.",
