	"body": "I talked to @ianlancetaylor about this, and he pointed out that it _is_ convenient for users to have one go command in their binary and be able to use the -compiler flag to flip between them for building their own code (the go command doesn't know anything about the gccgo standard library; this is only about $GOPATH). \r\n\r\nGiven that, I do believe that as long as we have the -compiler we might as well get the release tags right. Ian and I talked about having a $GCCGOTAGS, but on reflection I don't think that's quite right either. Can we give gccgo and llgo the same option that means \"print the Go release tags to use\" and then just ask them, at roughly the same time we consult $GCCGO?\r\n\r\nThis is actually close to what comment 2 suggested, but a built-in option seems much better than compiling and running a whole Go program.\r\n",
