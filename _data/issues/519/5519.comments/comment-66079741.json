As an experiment (because I don't\nknow how else to capture this information), also export GOGCTRACE=1. \n\nIf the program hangs with the channel added, just for arguments sake, please hit it with\na SIGQUIT and post the results.\n\nMy working theory at the moment is gc is blocking progress of the profile dump. It isn't\na great theory.\u003c/pre\u003e",
