I also checked, it works in Firefox 38 and IE 11. If following major browsers implementation was an argument in the previous decision, maybe balance in favor of consistency and allow it.\r\n\r\nNo, this statement is misleading. If any major browsers (and curl) wouldn't be able to handle spaces in cookie values Go probably wouldn't have allowed them. The support in major browsers works just in one direction: \"No complete support in browser\" ==\u003e \"No support in Go\" cannot be reverted to state \"Major browser support\" ==\u003e \"Go should support it too.\"\r\n ",
