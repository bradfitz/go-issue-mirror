There's no great way to distinguish between an interop problem (if that's what it is... some bug on either side, or both), or an actual slow response hitting your timeout. Falling back h2 to h1 whenever an h2 response was legitimately slow doesn't work. Especially for general http retry reasons. (non-idempotent methods, etc)\r\n\r\nI'll work on a preparing a Docker container with mod_h2 so I can reproduce this, unless somebody already has one.\r\n\r\n@songgao, do you have a minimal repro?\r\n",
