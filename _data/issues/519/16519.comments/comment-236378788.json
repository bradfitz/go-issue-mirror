Pardon if I ask questions that don't really make all that much sense. ;-)\r\n\r\nThe original symptom came up with my use of keybase.io. It would validate my identity on my website over https, but not http. I mentioned it to @maxtaco. I believe he followed up with @songgao, and now there's this issue on GitHub. And frankly all that is so damn cool! I love open source! :-)\r\n\r\nIf I follow everything above, it breaks when using http2. I've disabled my http2 module in apache and restarted the daemon. So why can't I still validate?\r\n\r\nWorks: https://wohlford.co/.well-known/keybase.txt\r\n\r\nDoesn't work: http://wohlford.co/.well-known/keybase.txt\r\n\r\nI'm thinking there is something else going on here besides h2/h2c issues. Don't want us to miss that if true.",
