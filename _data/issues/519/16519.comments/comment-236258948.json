	"body": "@songgao, Go 1.6 had a bug where HTTP/2 was enabled by default on all HTTP clients except the default one, embarrassingly. It was a bug introduced almost immediately before Go 1.6 was released, in the process of fixing a different bug, embarrassingly. It was fixed in Go 1.6.2 (Go 1.6.1 was a security-only release).\r\n\r\nSo you weren't using Go's http2 stack with Go 1.6 probably.\r\n\r\n@icing, yeah, I suppose I could do that too. But would a PING frame force a flush of your buffers? That might be lower-risk at this stage of our release, which is just around the corner.\r\n",
