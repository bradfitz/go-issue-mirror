	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIt's a not uncommon mistake to use a unlabeled break statement inside a switch statement\nwith the intention to break a surrounding for loop:\n\nfor some_condition {\n   switch tag {\n   case foo:\n      ...\n      break  // intent is to break out of for loop\n   ...\n}\n\nThe compiler won't complain but the bug is non-obvious and often not easy to spot.\n\nBreak (and also continue) should require use of explicit labels. This will make the code\nmore readable and remove a not uncommon source of bugs. The benefit outweighs the minor\ninconvenience; also this cases don't occur too often.\n\nA slightly more complicated (but more convenient) approach would be to require the label\nonly if the target statement is ambiguous (i.e., a switch/for statement containing a\nbreak is not nested within another statement that could be targeted by the break; and\nanalogous for continue).\u003c/pre\u003e",
