The relevant code:\r\n\r\n\tvar w *big.Int\r\n\tif in, ok := c.(invertible); ok {\r\n\t\tw = in.Inverse(s)\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tw = new(big.Int).ModInverse(s, N)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThat new(big.Int) gets allocated on the stack.  It's a tricky case to get right, as on the other branch of the if it never gets initialized.  Is it marked as live at the next call?  That's next up in the investigation.",
