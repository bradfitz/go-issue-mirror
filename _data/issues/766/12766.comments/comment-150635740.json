	"body": "@rakyll  When it comes to future UI part of mobile package I hope the following is not true or set in stone yet. ios and android are so wildly different in api and philosophy. If android has an api that ios doesn't it should still be exposed, uniquely,  and vice versa. If using common api approach, the code could be a huge mess with branching logic for platform and then subranching for diff platform versions with all the quirks in between.\r\n \r\nImagine writing v4-support-libraries but now times 2 or 3 for ios/android/windows with common api calls. Looking at googles own supportlibraries code is like trying to count threads in a yarn ball as it is. \r\n\r\n\u003eThe mobile repo should avoid containing non cross-platform APIs as much as possible since the mobile packages gives a promise of API parity on multiple platforms",
