Write some code that needs formatting (say, wrong indentation)\n3. M-x gofmt\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nA formatted buffer\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nA \u0026quot;Use file: \u0026quot; prompt\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI actually went through the trouble of debugging this, and it boils down to a bug in\ndiff-mode itself, which means it simply cannot deal with file names (or paths) that\ninclude spaces, because of a faulty regular expression in diff-hunk-file-names, which\ngets called by diff-apply-hunk.\n\nI am primarily opening this issue so people can consider an alternate implementation\nthat does not depend on diff-mode or that can work around the space issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
