I have some new theories, but I clearly need to be able to test on my own now instead of bothering you. :)\r\n\r\nI tried to reproduce on GCE with a small machine running jessie; after an overnight run of 218 with CL 21964, I have no failures. At the rate you reported, I should have seen a handful. I'll leave it running for a while longer, but suggestions/ideas for setting up to reproduce myself would be welcome.\r\n",
