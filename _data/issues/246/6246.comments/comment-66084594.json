It will be slow and Python only\nworks around badly written code in a very special case, because it uses reference\ncounting.\n\nIt is possible to improve marginally the performance of string concatenation, but not to\nmake your quadratic program magically fast. Use a bytes.Buffer to build large strings\n(similarly in Python, use io.BytesIO or io.StringIO, not +=).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
