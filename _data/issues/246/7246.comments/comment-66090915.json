Then, in liblink, the AMRC instructions are either\nrewritten to AWORD, or, on goarm \u0026lt; 7, replaced with a branch to the\nfallback.\n\n./all.bash completes successfully on an ARMv7 with either GOARM=7 or\nGOARM=5. I have verified that the fallback is indeed present in both\nruntime.save_gm and runtime.load_gm when GOARM=5 but not when GOARM=7.\n\nIf all goes well, this should fix the armv5 builders.\n\nLGTM=iant\nR=iant, rsc\nCC=golang-codereviews\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/55540044\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/55540044\u003c/a\u003e\n\nCommitter: Ian Lance Taylor \u0026lt;iant@golang.org\u0026gt;\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Fixed**._",
