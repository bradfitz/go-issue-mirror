	"body": "The commands `go build`, `go list` and `go test` do not honor the build tags unless the full package path is specified. The issue occurs when using a command in the form `go list ./...` and one of the packages has all of the files guarded by build tags. With or without the `-tags` argument provided, the command fails to build, test or run the target package. If the full package path is provided, it works as expected.\r\n\r\nRather than try to describe all the steps to reproduce the issue, I've made a package available [here](https://github.com/stevvooe/tagsbug) to demonstrate. The README contains full instructions.\r\n\r\nThis behavior was observed on go1.4.2 on Mac OS X 10.10.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
