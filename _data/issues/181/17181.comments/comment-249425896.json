It is all the same, all assignments in golang are copies.\r\n\r\nSecond, the assignments of interface values have nothing related to the values hold by the interface values. Assignments of interface values are just copying the two fields of the interface values. There is no implementation optimizations (not to copy the hold values) made at all.",
