	"body": "Hi @agl,\r\n\r\nkeysFromMasterSecret() in crypto/tls/prf.go does\r\n\r\n    copy(seed[0:len(clientRandom)], serverRandom)\r\n    copy(seed[len(serverRandom):], clientRandom)\r\n\r\nThe first len() should be of serverRandom, not clientRandom.  It looks like a copy-and-paste error from the previous masterFromPreMasterSecret().  (They're the same length AFAIK, so no fault occurs.)\r\n\r\nBut I think both functions could have the first copy() be copy(seed, ...) as used elsewhere in prf.go.",
