I found\n`Encode.EncodeValue` will firstly buffer all the data to the memory (in enc.byteBuf),\nthen write it as a whole (by calling enc.writeMessage). This consumes almost the same\namout of memory as the value to encode. My program then occasionally panic because of\nout of memory.\n\nCan we make it better?\n\ngo version go1.3 linux/386\u003c/pre\u003e",
