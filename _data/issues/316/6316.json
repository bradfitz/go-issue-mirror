I haven't seen any other reports of problems with\ninstallation.\n\nI am trying to install Go on my MacBookPro 17, using either \t go1.1.2.darwin-amd64.pkg\nor go1.1.2.darwin-386.pkg  I am running OS X 10.8.4 Mountain Lion.  There's enough\nmemory and HD space available.\n\nOn either of them I get an unsuccessful installation.  No other message other than to\ntry installing again, and contact the provider.\n\nI've tried installing again.  \nI've tried re-downloading the package file(s)\n\nIs there something I am overlooking?  Is there a log file that I can look at to\ndetermine what is causing the problem?\n\nmelkanner@gmail.com\u003c/pre\u003e",
