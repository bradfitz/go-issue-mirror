Run gotest\n3. gotest will give an error saying \u0026quot;bug\u0026quot; was redeclared because it is\ncompiling bug_test.go twice.\n\nThe problem is that grep is getting two results in bug_test.go for '^package [\t ]' so it\nadds the file to $gofiles twice. Probably there's a way to things so we only use the\nfirst result from the file.\u003c/pre\u003e",
