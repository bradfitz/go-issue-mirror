Thanks.\r\n\r\nYou have some misunderstanding about types, methods, and interfaces, but I'm not sure precisely what it is.  `BarInterface` is satisfied by any type that implements the method `Bar() string`.  The type `*Foo` implements that interface.  The function `foo` in your example returns a value of type `*Foo`.  That type implements the interface, so all is well.  I'm not sure why you think it wouldn't be.",
