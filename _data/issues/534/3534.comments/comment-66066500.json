However, I support the idea of always compiling with -Werror and think that\nthe extra debugging Clang gives adds value in the majority of circumstances. \n\nGiven the choice between adding another special flag for Clang (or whatever\ncompiler.next) and making a change to one file, I think the latter is the best choice.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to @davecheney._\n\n_Status changed to **Started**._",
