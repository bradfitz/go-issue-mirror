	"body": "Well, it used to be a PITA to get VSync working at all on Linux. It does work at least with the proprietary nvidia drivers. Programmers cannot however expect that enabling VSync will have any effect. This  applies to all OSes: if the user has globally disabled VSync in the driver settings, enabling it on the application side will do nothing. IMHO, the best approach to this is to try to enable it, but never expect it to be enabled, and in any case, this should not be dealt with in the mobile/app package since this is related to application timing (where requirements differ greatly from one app to another). #9413 seems to be a good place to debate about this.\r\n\r\n@capnm I opened a new issue against the X11 event-loop in #10054 where your rewrite of the event loop looks to be a good fix. I will however leave the VSync related stuff and frame clamping out of it ;)",
