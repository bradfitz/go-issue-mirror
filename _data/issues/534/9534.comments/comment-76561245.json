I missed the bug notification and deleted the cloned archive,\r\nFWIW here is a copy: https://gist.github.com/capnm/9de3a3aab7bd1acdd13d\r\n\r\nAn another issue I had, was that the current event handling eats without a vsync 100% cpu.\r\nI don't have currently the time to setup things and submit a CL myself, if you'd like, you can\r\ntake a look what I did and go ahead :-)\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/capnm/9de3a3aab7bd1acdd13d#file-x11-c-L194",
