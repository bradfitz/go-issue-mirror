Result: \"hello, race\" displays consistently.\r\n\r\nCompile present using Go tip, open the demo, and hit Run repeatedly. Result: \"hello, race\" displays maybe one time in three, although the program claims to have exited successfully.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a logical race in present or playground that the scheduler changes have exposed.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a high priority, in that I wouldn't want any GopherCon presenters to do a last minute `present` upgrade and have any unpleasant discoveries.\r\n",
