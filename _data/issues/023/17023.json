	"body": "CL 24814 contains a minor optimization for 386/amd64: Ignore a few common runtime functions that take no arguments when deciding whether a function is a leaf function and is thus eligible for being marked NOSPLIT and thus having no function prolog.\r\n\r\nKeith suggested some ways during code review to make this analysis much more powerful. This issue is a reminder to investigate those suggestions.\r\n",
