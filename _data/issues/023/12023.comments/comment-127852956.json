	"body": "I'm totally fine hearing this was a bug fix and having this bug get closed. If that happens, as a user, I'd love for the database/sql driver maintainers to get some heads up. \r\n\r\nI'm currently in a bit of a discussion with one for the mysql driver about this in that other ticket. They were surprised by the change in behavior, but, unfortunately, more surprised by their users wanting to control and modify the strings before they go in. I think the postgres folks are more familiar with their users using and working with db strings (including heroku's DATABASE env variable stuff, etc), but some of the mysql folks are, uh, not so clear they want to support this use case. \r\n\r\nThere might be more issues like we're seeing from monogodb and mysql and a little bit of foreknowledge might make driver devs amenable to changes in their APIs to accommodate their users or maybe just some documentation on really solid workarounds.",
