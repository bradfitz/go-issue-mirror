(40 LOC; ~100 lines of data)\n\nHere's how it runs:\n\n: 6g regex.go \n: 6l -o regex regex.6\n: echo ReplaceAllStringFunc with same sized replacement text\nReplaceAllStringFunc with same sized replacement text\n: time ./regex 1\n\nreal\t0m0.567s\nuser\t0m0.568s\nsys\t0m0.000s\n: echo ReplaceAllStringFunc with possibly shorter replacement text\nReplaceAllStringFunc with possibly shorter replacement text\n: time ./regex 2\n\nreal\t0m0.559s\nuser\t0m0.552s\nsys\t0m0.012s\n: echo ReplaceAllStringFunc with longer replacement text\nReplaceAllStringFunc with longer replacement text\n: time ./regex 3\n\nreal\t0m0.595s\nuser\t0m0.600s\nsys\t0m0.000s\n: echo ReplaceAllStrings with longer text\nReplaceAllStrings with longer text\n: time ./regex 4\n\nreal\t0m0.014s\nuser\t0m0.016s\nsys\t0m0.000s\n: echo ReplaceAllStrings with shorter text\nReplaceAllStrings with shorter text\n: time ./regex 5\n\nreal\t0m0.011s\nuser\t0m0.008s\nsys\t0m0.004s\n\n\nIt seems that my suspicion was wrong: it doesn't seem to matter what size the\nreplacement is; the problem seems to be the overhead of calling a function vs. doing\nthings directly.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1198/4/regex.go\"\u003eregex.go\u003c/a\u003e (5983 bytes)",
