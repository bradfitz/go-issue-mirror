The pattern replaces every lower\ncase word, not every line, so it's doing a lot of work and, from profiling data, there's\nnothing obviously wrong. You're generating tons of garbage with this algorithm and\nthat's where a lot of the time is going. If you split into lines, munged each line, and\nstitched it back together afterwards you'd generate less garbage, but I make no\npredictions about improvements in performance.\n\nBut I think there's a misapprehension in your test, too.  Cases 4 and 5 don't loop, so\nof course they're much faster.\n\nHonestly, half a second to do what you're asking it to do isn't crazy slow. This is a\nvery inefficient program.\u003c/pre\u003e",
