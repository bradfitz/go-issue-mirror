We should perhaps (I stress perhaps) do something about that.\n\nSeveral possibilities arise:\n\n1) Just publish the .md file in the output. Probably a bad choice since it would require\ngodoc to understand the format and figure out where to present it in the output. Godoc\nalready has enough to do.\n\n2) Provide a separate tool that does understand .md file and writes a doc.go for you, so\nit's easy to provide the information to godoc.\n\n3) Provide a separate tool that takes godoc output and writes a .md file for you, so\nit's easy to provide the information to github.\n\nProbably more.\n\nFor discussion.\u003c/pre\u003e",
