For every line in each file (typically 1000 lines\nof 75 chars) if I call regexp.ReplaceAllStringFunc() with a regex of the form\n\u0026quot;(^|[^a-zA-Z._#])(break|case|...|true)([^a-zA-Z_]|$)\u0026quot; i.e., with about 30\nalternatives in the middle expression, my regression tests (processing 4 files) take\naround 17secs. But if I comment out the call to regexp.ReplaceAllStringFunc() the time\ndrops to \u0026lt; 0.5sec.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\ndebian testing 64-bit\n\nWhich revision are you using?
