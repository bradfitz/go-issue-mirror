	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the\nlatest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Open a JPEG file using: os.Open(\u0026quot;\u0026lt;PATH/TO/IMAGE.jpg\u0026gt;\u0026quot;)\n2. Try to decode the file with: image.Decode(imgf)\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nJPEG file successfully decoded.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nError: unsupported JPEG feature: unknown marker\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nN/A\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.0.2\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI modified image/jpeg/reader.go to print some more information and the unknown marker is\n\u0026quot;0xd5\u0026quot; which is a restart marker that should be parsed in the processSOS\nfunction. It seems that the function is not going far enough in the file and misses the\nrestart marker.\n\nBefore getting into processSOS, this is the list of markers I get in decode:\n\n2012/09/14 18:10:01 Got marker: e1\n2012/09/14 18:10:01 Got marker: db\n2012/09/14 18:10:01 Got marker: c4\n2012/09/14 18:10:01 Got marker: dd\n2012/09/14 18:10:01 Got marker: c0\n2012/09/14 18:10:01 Got marker: da\n\nOutput from jpeginfo -c:\n  2592 x 1944 24bit Exif  N 1143840  [OK]\n\nNo image attached on the bug but sent directly to nigeltao@.\u003c/pre\u003e",
