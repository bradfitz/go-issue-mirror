Calling *Abs* on Windows for example might return a path containing DOS-style 8.3 short names. On Linux, *Abs* might return a path with symlinks.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nI was expecting to find a function to canonize a path, so paths can be safely compared.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nI did not find a way canonize a path / to create a unique absolute path.",
