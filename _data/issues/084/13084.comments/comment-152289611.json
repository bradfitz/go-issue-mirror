	"body": "A local repo is a remote source in the sense that its origin is a different directory ;)\r\nSince in `git clone source dest` the source can be any bare git repo.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, if I want up to date packages I need to use `-u` which I understand is short for update, altough it says something like \"utilizes network\". So it forces a clone or pull or whatever, as long as it's up to date.\r\n\r\nHow to distinguish? If the url starts with `/` it's probably a local repo.\r\n\r\nThing is, I don't need an update of the local repo. I don't know why `go get -u` tries to update itself, but it does and there's this error.\r\nSo the issue is, why does it try to update itself in the first place?",
