	"body": "@dturner-tw thanks for the patch.\r\n\r\nHowever I already patched my local clone of x/sys in order to add support for fstatat for linux amd64.  This will allow me to test my project and waiting for official support before releasing it.\r\n\r\nJust some little differences from your code.\r\n\r\nInstead of generating the `newfstatat` syscall, with the required wrapper function, I declared the syscall as\r\n```go\r\n//sys\tFstatat(fd int, path string, stat *Stat_t, flags int) (err error) = SYS_NEWFSTATAT\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother difference is that I declared Fstatat in syscall_linux_amd64.go, instead of syscall_linux.go, but this a topic that I'm not sure to understand well.",
