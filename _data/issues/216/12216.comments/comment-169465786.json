	"body": "The issue here isn't really with -buildmode=c-shared.  It's with using cgo to call a function that is not defined as far as cgo knows, because it is actually defined in a Go package.  This comes up pretty naturally with -buildmode=c-shared, but it's easy to construct a similar case in other build modes as well.\r\n\r\nThe real fix might be to have cgo do its links with -r, and not fuss about undefined symbols.  Or have cgo use --unresolved-symbols=ignore-all; I'm not sure which would work better.  Either way, we would let the final link give any errors about undefined symbols.",
