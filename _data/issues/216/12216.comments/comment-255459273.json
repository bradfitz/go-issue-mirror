	"body": "The two options are completely different.  Using `-r` tells the linker to generate a relocatable object file.  Using `--unresolved-symbols=ignore-all` tells the linker to not report errors about undefined symbols.  The advantage of `-r` is that most linkers support it.  The advantage of `--unresolved-symbols=ignore-all` is that it does a normal link, not a relocatable link, so we don't have to deal with relocations.\r\n\r\nFor either one I'm not quite sure what will happen with an undefined symbol.  We may be left without any using DWARF info, which could be a problem in some cases.",
