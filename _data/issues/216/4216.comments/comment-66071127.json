I don't see any way around this.\n\nAs this has come up yet again via \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/7227\"\u003eissue #7227\u003c/a\u003e, I have to question this. Why not use\nkqueue with signal filters on the BSDs and use signalfd() on Linux? That'd allow Go to\nreceive the signals no matter what the handler happen to be set to by 3rdparties.\u003c/pre\u003e",
