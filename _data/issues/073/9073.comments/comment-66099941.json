What we need to find out is why\nit was failing on your system.  But I see that in the most recent run, it didn't fail. \nI don't know why it failed before and I don't why it succeeded now.  What I was\nsuggesting is that you run syscall.test, such that it fails, and then run it under\nstrace to see why it fails.\n\nThe runtime/pprof test failures are uninteresting, they are due to qemu.  Ignore those.\u003c/pre\u003e",
