It is on\nyou to demonstrate that. Best way to do it, I think, is to write a Go test that\nestablishes connection between SSL client and server - all in one test. You could run\nthis test in a loop to measure performance. You could use runtime memory stats to show\nmemory increases. You could use benchmarking tools in test package to measure your\nfindings. Please, have a go and report your findings.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
