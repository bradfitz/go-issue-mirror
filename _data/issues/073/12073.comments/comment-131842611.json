	"body": "This is somewhat related to the request to render CJK characters as two characters.  In general, there are other classes of runes for which one would need to use alternative widths: fullwidth, modifiers, Jamo V+T, etc.  If we make a change to the width handling, we should take these other cases in to account and allow supporting it.  We could limit ourselves to determining width on a rune-by-rune basis.\r\n\r\nThe column width of runes could look something like this (based on http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/wcwidth.c, but slightly different):\r\n- 0: Cc control characters\r\n- 0: Non-spacing and enclosing combining characters (Mn/Me).\r\n- 1: SOFT HYPHEN (U+00AD) (Cf)\r\n- 0: Other format characters (Cf)\r\n- 0: Hangul Jamo V+T medial vowels and final consonants (U+1160-U+11FF)\r\n- 2: Spacing characters of type EastAsianWide (W) or EastAsianFullwidth (F) as defined in Unicode TR#11 (see also golang.org/x/text/width and width.Kind).\r\n- 1: All remaining characters, including all printable, Unicode control characters, and width.EastAsianAmbiguous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
