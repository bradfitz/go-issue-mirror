Note that if you run qemu without \"-curses\" mode, you see more kernel output. The problem seems to be that networking never comes up on Ubuntu Trusty.  (we use Trusty instead of Debian Wheezy because nacl's sel_ldr needs a newer libc... but if sid works now from #9873, perhaps we should just use that image instead of trusty)\r\n\r\n",
