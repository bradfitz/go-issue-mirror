	"body": "The nacl Dockerfile builder is one of the last images that needs to be converted to be VM-based.\r\n\r\nAlso, @minux says (in https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/1755/):\r\n\r\n\u003e Yes, I just checked that we need at least pepper_39.\r\n\u003e https://storage.googleapis.com/nativeclient-mirror/nacl/nacl_sdk/39.0.2171.99/naclsdk_linux.tar.bz2\r\n\u003e Could you update the nacl builders and then I will submit this change.\r\n\u003e Thanks!\r\n\u003e (Although we should rarely require a new version of sel_ldr, I\r\n\u003e wonder if we should make the nacl builder download the sel_ldr\r\n\u003e program at start up rather than bake one version into the rootfs.)\r\n\r\nI'd rather bake in an sel_ldr, though, so we know what the builder is. Or at least make the URL part of the build configuration. It might be nice to test different versions of sel_ldr in different builders, like we have different FreeBSD, OS X and Linux builders for different versions.\r\n\r\nLast time I tried to convert the nacl builders, I remember that I ran into some problems making them work with the buildlet, but I forget what it was. Creating a bug so I can log progress or problems.",
