	"body": "Could the builders detect that there isn't any leftover temporary\r\nfiles in $TMPDIR after testing each repo? (We need to whitelist\r\na few, for example gopath-api-*)\r\n\r\nIdeally this should be treated a build failure and reported back\r\nto the CL that triggered this.\r\n\r\nEach time I logged into the netbsd-386 builder, I find a lot\r\ntemporary files in /tmp. However, as I don't know which build\r\ngenerated them, I have to manually check if the bug is still\r\nthere.",
