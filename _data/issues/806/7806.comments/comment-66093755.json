It's all.bat's job to do\nthe exit; make.bat is just supposed to set the failure status in GOBUILDFAIL. I'm\nwilling to tweak make.bat but only if it keeps all.bat doing the right thing.\n\nDmitriy, try this and see if all.bat still does the right thing for a broken build:\n\ng% hg diff make.bat\ndiff -r fac90a291326 src/make.bat\n--- a/src/make.bat\tWed May 21 13:23:24 2014 +1000\n+++ b/src/make.bat\tWed May 21 10:37:46 2014 -0400\n@@ -117,3 +117,4 @@\n set GOBUILDFAIL=1\n \n :end\n+if x%GOBUILDEXIT%==x1 exit %GOBUILDFAIL%\ng% \n\nIf so, great, send the CL. If not, then this is working as intended and you should write\nyour own perf.bat that is a copy of all.bat with the run.bat call removed.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.4**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
