As identified here, it fails in misconfigured environments where a user is not a part of their primary group.  Unfortunately, I don't think there's a cross-platform way to make this test hermetic.  However, the underlying `getgrouplist` call is documented to always add the supplied gid to the list, so this surprises me.\r\n\r\n@bradfitz Should I go ahead and move all platforms to the /etc/group fallback? Seems more reliable than all the woes that my CL has introduced. Sorry that this has created so much noise.\r\n\r\nFor both of you, it would be helpful to know the number of supplementary groups your user is a part of -- is it greater than 256?",
