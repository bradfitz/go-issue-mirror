The\nerror was \u0026quot;x509: certificate signed by unknown authority.\u0026quot;\n\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Mike Lewis \u0026lt;mikelikespie@gmail.com\u0026gt;\nDate: Wed, Mar 13, 2013 at 2:44 PM\nSubject: [go-nuts] Non-Obvious Failure with x509 and custom root CAs\nTo: golang-nuts@googlegroups.com\n\n\nHi,\n\nLong story short:\nI was trying do http Get against a url with a custom root CA (that was on my keychain). \nReceived \u0026quot;x509: certificate signed by unknown authority.\u0026quot;\n\nEnded up going x509 code and ended up landing in x509.go where hashType.Available() was\nreturning false.\n\nOur CA was using SHA512.  The workaround for me was to 'import _\n\u0026quot;crypto/sha512\u0026quot;' in my code.  However, this was anything but intuitive.  I\nbasically had to add a bunch of print statements throughout go's source code to figure\nout where it was failing.\n\nIs this documented anywhere?  Or is this a bug?  Basically the http library will fail on\nany root certs that use algos that aren't imported by a transitive dependency and will\ngive a very obscure error.\n\nThanks,\nMike\u003c/pre\u003e",
