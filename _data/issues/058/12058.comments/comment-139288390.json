I'm not sure what you mean by `LDFLAGS --static`, but that is not the same as the --static option to the pkg-config command.\r\n\r\nThe reference to private libraries is because when linking statically you need to explicitly list all the libraries you need.  Shared libraries include a list of their dependencies, so you only have to link against the main shared library.  Static libraries do not include such a list, so you need to link against all of them.",
