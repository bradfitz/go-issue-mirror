The only problem I see is a need to ask\n\u003e everyone who's using --gccgoflags \"-static\" or --ldflags '-extldflags\n\u003e \"-static\"' to theirgo buildcommand to also add-tags static. It would be\n\u003e great if such a tag (or any other we could use) will magically appear\n\u003e itself (similar to $GOOS, $GOARCH or saycgo` tags), so we won't have to\n\u003e modify all the building scripts.\n\u003e\nMy proposed solution doesn't require the user to pass extra -ldflags or\n-gccgoflags\nbecause it includes \"#cgo LDFLAGS: -static\". (there is a bug preventing\ngccgo\nfrom working correctly in this case, but that's a separate issue.)\n\nsee https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12058#issuecomment-139074739\n",
