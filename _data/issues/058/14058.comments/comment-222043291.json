	"body": "From my perspective this change is on probation. We are updating broken tests in Google's sources assuming it will go in, and we'll keep the change in the Go 1.7 beta. So far I don't think we've seen any breakage other than golden files in tests. If that's the only breakage caused, then the change can stay. But if we learn of serious production problems caused by this, we should think strongly about rolling it back.\r\n\r\nThe saving grace for this change is that time.Duration.String already returns any number of different suffixes in its result, making it a good default for just printing, but typically not nearly consistent enough for use in real production code, where you want to see the same units no matter what, so that different values being printed are comparable (it's too easy to miss the difference between 10m, 10ms, 10us or think that 5.2s \u003e 4m). So there is a chance basically only tests will break.",
