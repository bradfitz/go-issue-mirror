	"body": "In general, `time.Duration.String` does not use its internal resolution to indicate significant figures.  For example, it formats `time.Second` as `\"1s\"`, not as `\"1.000000000s\"` or `\"1000000000ns\"`.  Expecting the zero `time.Duration`'s formatting to reflect its precision seems arbitrary and inconsistent.\r\n\r\nAlso, the godocs are explicit that the reason `time.Nanosecond` is formatted as `\"1ns\"` is to avoid the leading zero in `\"0.000000001s\"`.  There will be leading zeros in either `\"0s\"` and `\"0ns\"`, so that does not seem like a valid argument to favor `\"0ns\"` either.\r\n\r\nLastly, `time.Minute + 1` is formatted as `\"1m0.000000001s\"`, not as `\"1m1ns\"`, so it seems in general we favor formatting `time.Duration` values in units of seconds, not nanoseconds.",
