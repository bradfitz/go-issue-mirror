My thinking is that people doing that are probably also writing a program in C, and therefore have a C compiler. But I'm obviously not a Windows developer, so I may be wrong.\r\n\r\nHere I dare disagree: on Windows, DLLs are very often used as a mechanism for providing plugins. In such a case, you start with some third-party app written by somebody else (quite often under proprietary license, so no source-code; but it's the same for open-source too, [see e.g. Notepad++](http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php?title=Plugin_Central)), which you want to extend with a plugin. If the app supports plugins, it would usually [describe an interface that a plugin DLL must conform to](http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/Plugin_Development#What_should_a_plugin_do.3F), and how to register the DLL in the app (e.g. specific directory where you must put the DLL). So, no C toolchain in sight really; it's quite normal to write the DLL e.g. in [Delphi or C#](http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php?title=Plugin_Development#How_to_develop_a_plugin). ",
