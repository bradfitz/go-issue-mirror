How do you make it crash?\r\n\r\nBut yes we would have to change the way we do TLS, if we want to have Go DLL loaded by Go executable. From what I can gather on the net. We can use PE file facilities (search for .tls in pecoff.doc), or we can use TlsGetValue Windows API. Given that you use gcc to generate DLL, PE file fiddling is not an option, unless someone knows how to arrange for gcc to help with that. That leaves us with TlsGetValue. I am concerned that TlsGetValue call might be expensive comparing with what we do now, but I don't know any alternative. Maybe others will comment too.\r\n\r\nAlex",
