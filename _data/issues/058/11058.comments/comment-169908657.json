You can fix the crash by changing some code in cmd/internal/obj/x86/asm6.go to generate same code in both executable and DLL version of runtime.rt0_go. But that is not complete solution. If you reread earlier discussion about TLS, we all agreed that Go DLL cannot use same approach for TLS as current Go executable does. If Go DLL is loaded by Go executable they will be stepping on each other toes. Perhaps it is OK just to get first Go DLL going, but ultimately we'll need to do something different here. There is bigger fish to fry here.\r\n\r\n\u003e As long as I can ask questions of people who might know the answers.\r\n\r\nEveryone is happy to help you with what they know.\r\n\r\n\u003e I might move slowly.\r\n\r\nNoone else wants to do it at this moment. It is completely up to you.\r\n\r\nAlex",
