	"body": "\u003e This issue is specifically about -buildmode=c-shared. The only reason to use -buildmode=c-shared is to build a DLL that can be linked into a program written in C. My thinking is that people doing that are probably also writing a program in C, and therefore have a C compiler. But I'm obviously not a Windows developer, so I may be wrong.\r\n\r\nFair enough. Similar I am not familiar with what -buildmode provides. What -buildmode flag should I use to build Windows DLL? DLL that can be called from any Windows executable or another DLL. These others (executables and DLLs) can be written in C, but don't have to be - they can be written in Go. We (Go executables we build) use system DLLs (produced by Microsoft) all the time. Do you see Go provide way to build DLLs just like these?\r\n\r\nAlex",
