	"body": "Turns out that the runtime code I borrowed from Linux uses a different argument-passing protocol than gcc on windows uses. After fixing that, everything works fine. My simple test runs to completion with no errors.\r\n\r\nThe changes are https://github.com/nadiasvertex/go/commit/1fc1f59fceb1794a7c4723742434d30f9ed5c14c and https://github.com/nadiasvertex/go/commit/81e3aa8a91b98d255fe872aee6401da356d38fe6\r\n\r\nMy current build script is awkward because there are still two bugs left to figure out:\r\n\r\n1. Something deletes the temporary .o files before \"ar\" is finished with them (or possibly something isn't done writing them before 'ar' reads them.)\r\n\r\n2. For some reason 'ld' ignores the .ctor section when the .o is in an .a, but when it is a raw .o it works fine. In other words 'ld -o test driver.o test.a' fails but 'ld -o test driver.o tmpo/go.o tmp0/000001.o tmpo/000000.o' works perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if the linker is using any kind of asynchrony for (1), and for (2) I have no clue. Any ideas would be helpful.\r\n",
