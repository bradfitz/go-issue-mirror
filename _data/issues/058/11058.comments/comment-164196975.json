	"body": "@alexbrainman and @ianlancetaylor Thank you very much for all the help. I am now in a kind of frustrating place, so perhaps you can help me more.\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure I know _what_ exactly needs to be written into the PE file, at least for gcc:\r\n\r\n1. On Windows, gcc expects to find a list of function pointers starting with 0 and terminated with 0xffffffff in a section called .ctors. (https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Initialization.html) It doesn't matter whether this is ELF or PE, it's the same thing.\r\n2. The linker will combine all of the contents of these lists in the .o files into an array called __CTOR_LIST__. \r\n3. The glibc runtime cooperates with the linker to generate a function called __do_global_ctors which will run through this list and call all of the functions on it.\r\n\r\nThe problem I have now is:\r\n\r\n1. I'm not sure how to find out the address of the _rt0_amd64_windows_lib function that should be written here.\r\n2. I'm not sure if I need to write a reloc entry somewhere in case the symbol gets relocated.\r\n3. I can't seem to figure out how to actually write binary data into the section.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry to be a pain, but I feel like I'm really close to getting -buildmode=c-archive working, I just can't seem get the final pieces.\r\n\r\nI found Cntxt.AllSyms, and I can find the symbol record for \"_rt0_amd64_windows_lib\", but the symbol record has a lot of data in it that doesn't obviously appear to be the address (or an address.)\r\n\r\nI also saw the Vputl, Lputl functions. However, when I call them the result data doesn't appear to show up in the file.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all your help.",
