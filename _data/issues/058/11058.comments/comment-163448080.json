That normally happens because the linker puts INITENTRY (the rt0 symbol) in the INITARRAY section (see addinitarrdata in cmd/link/internal/ld/data.go).  However, although that works for ELF, it likely does nothing for PE.  You need to figure out how to arrange for that symbol to be called at program startup time.",
