	"body": "Thanks, Alex, that makes sense. That raises other questions. \r\n\r\n1. Since it looks like each DLL would have its own copy of the Go runtime, it would not be able to respect the GOMAXPROCS variable. The main process and each DLL would load generate up to GOMAXPROCS system threads. Is that acceptable?\r\n2. It seems like they would also have separate GCs, so does the runtime \"know\" when it is calling a DLL and conspire to make passing blocks of memory safe?\r\n3. Are there any plans to simply make the runtime a DLL in its own right in cases where a Go executable loads Go DLLs, and just have them all depend on the same copy of the runtime?  ",
