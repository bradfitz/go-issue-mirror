The point is, the file contains C code, and is compiled with a C compiler.  It defines three functions\r\n\r\n x_cgo_sys_thread_create must start a new thread running func, passing arg to it.  This is the win32 CreateThread function or the Visual Studio _beginthread function.\r\n\r\nx_cgo_wait_runtime_init_done must wait until x_cgo_notify_runtime_init_done has been called.  x_cgo_notify_runtine_init_done must let x_cgo_wait_runtine_init_done execute.  I don't know much about Windows synchronization, but I would guess this could be done using the win32 CreateSemaphore and WaitForSingleObject functions.",
