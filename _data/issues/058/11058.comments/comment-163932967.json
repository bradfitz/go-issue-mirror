I added some diagnostics which show that this code is called on Windows as well.\r\n\r\nMy question is, where does the section called \".init_array\" go after it is created in data.go? A related question is: How do I get access to the the data which is written there?\r\n\r\nAlso, I found this very interesting discussion of .init_array vs. .ctors in gcc: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46770",
