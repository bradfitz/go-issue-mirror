But that address is an \"absolute\" address. I don't think absolute address will work for you. Maybe you need offset from start of PE section containing that function. Maybe you need to provide relocation for these. I would fiddle with correspondent object file compiled by gcc to see what is required. I have built github.com/alexbrainman/goissue10776/pedump for similar purpose. It is, probably, not as good as objdump, but it is written in Go, and I can do with it what I like easily. It might also help you see how PE file is structured.\r\n\r\n\u003e I can't seem to figure out how to actually write binary data into the section\r\n\r\nSee addimports as an example. Vputl and Lputl and many others certainly work. The IO is buffered, so you won't see them writing to the file immediately. I also suggest you check your position in the file - you might be writing somewhere in the middle of the file, instead of end. I am not sure what you're doing. Perhaps if you show us you changes, someone might be able to help you.\r\n\r\nAlex",
