	"body": "For c-shared each separate library will have its own copy of the Go runtime.  That is normal and expected.  Each library should be considered as a separate independent unit.\r\n\r\nYou mention that the main process will be using its own GOMAXPROCS.  When using c-shared, the expectation is that you are creating a DLL to be loaded into a C program.  Creating a DLL to be loaded into a Go program implies the plugin interface, which is not yet implemented anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe runtime does not know when it is calling a DLL.  Calling into a c-shared DLL is just like calling into any C DLL.  If you are trying to call it from Go, you need to use cgo.",
