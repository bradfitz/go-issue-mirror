Each relocation record is:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Reloc struct {\r\n\tVirtualAddress   uint32\r\n\tSymbolTableIndex uint32\r\n\tType             uint16\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nVirtualAddress is offset in the PE section this relocation table belongs to where the data needs to be adjusted. Type determines how to adjust it. And SymbolTableIndex points to a \"symbol\" that contains all information external linker needs to produce relocation value. SymbolTableIndex is an index into PE \"symbol table\". You can read about it in pecoff.doc, but it lives somewhere after all PE sections are finished and is pointed by PointerToSymbolTable. You should be able to use objdump to look at PE symbol table of your C obj file and do something similar. You can look at addpesymtable in pe.go to see how we write symbol table. Perhaps Ian is correct that it points to the whole .text section, but you would have to write a correspondent entry into symbol table anyway.\r\n\r\nAlex",
