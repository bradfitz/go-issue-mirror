It looks like the init thread aborts before it ever gets to the runtime initialization part.\r\n\r\nThe addresses passed in to pthread_create look correct. When I change the code to branch directly to the runtime initializer (instead of spawning a thread) it seems to complete correctly. So it looks like it's isolated to bad setup of the thread. \r\n\r\n```\r\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\r\n[Switching to Thread 1280.0x670]\r\n0x000007fefd921520 in msvcrt!_HUGE () from C:\\Windows\\system32\\msvcrt.dll\r\n(gdb) bt\r\n#0  0x000007fefd921520 in msvcrt!_HUGE () from C:\\Windows\\system32\\msvcrt\r\n#1  0x00000000004c7f57 in pthread_create_wrapper ()\r\n#2  0x000007fefd89415f in srand () from C:\\Windows\\system32\\msvcrt.dll\r\n#3  0x000007fefd896ebd in msvcrt!_ftime64_s ()\r\n   from C:\\Windows\\system32\\msvcrt.dll\r\n#4  0x0000000076fb5a4d in KERNEL32!BaseThreadInitThunk ()\r\n   from C:\\Windows\\system32\\kernel32.dll\r\n#5  0x00000000770eb831 in ntdll!RtlUserThreadStart ()\r\n   from C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll\r\n```",
