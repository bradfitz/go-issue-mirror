	"body": "\u003e If you just want to build a DLL that does not contain any C code, you don't have to use external linker. I am sure you can modify Go linker to produce what you want. Go linker does just that when it creates windows executables. I don't see how creating of DLL would be different.\r\n\r\nIt's unusual to want to build a shared library/DLL if you don't have a C toolchain available.  On Unix we decided to simply rely on that, rather than spend the time to teach the Go linker how to generate a shared library.  On Windows, in which DLLs are more different from executables than they are on ELF, I would suggest following the same strategy.  Since in the general case we must use external linking when generating a shared library, I don't think it's so bad to always require it.",
