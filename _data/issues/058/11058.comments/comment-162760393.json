	"body": "The intent is to write a plugin package that can be used to open Go shared libraries built with -buildmode=plugin.  But this has not been implemented (see https://golang.org/s/execmodes for this and more about -buildmode).\r\n\r\nOn Windows, it may already work to use -buildmode=c-shared and open the DLL from a Go program.  The disadvantage would be that you can only use functions with a C style interface, and you would have two different Go heaps and garbage collectors--one in the main program and one in the DLL.  That is, -buildmode=c-shared is intended to give you a complete DLL that can be opened by a program written in any language, so it includes a complete copy of the Go runtime.",
