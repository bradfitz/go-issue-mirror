	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nBuild an operating system distribution of Go 1.2 from the official source,\n\u003ca href=\"https://go.googlecode.com/files/go1.2.src.tar.gz\"\u003ehttps://go.googlecode.com/files/go1.2.src.tar.gz\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\nComparing to the binary versions of Go available on the download website, building Go\nfrom the supplied tarball produces an install which lacks godoc and the vet and cover\nsubcommands.\n\nThis cannot be corrected by the user as the distro packaged locations are owned by root.\n\nPlease use labels and text to provide additional information.\n\nThis has caused issues for downstream packaging folks as they do not use the misc/dist\ntool, but expect the tarball to be complete.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/golang/+bug/1259414\"\u003ehttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/golang/+bug/1259414\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/go.rb\"\u003ehttps://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/go.rb\u003c/a\u003e\n\n^ note, relies on the fact that Go is installed in a user writeable directory\n\nCould the Go 1.2 tarball be amended to include the additional source (misc/dist already\ndownloads and builds it) or the additional source published alongside the 1.2 tarball.\u003c/pre\u003e",
