(I'm not talking about the dev.ssa branch, the\r\nproblem there is too specific to that branch.)\r\n\r\nRight now, I think the only reason is because inlined function\r\nwon't appear in stack traces, and that is a bug of our back\r\ntracer, and if we want to be able to inline more, we have to\r\nsolve the problem. (Unless we starts to convert recursive\r\nfunctions to iterative ones or do tailcall optimization, this\r\nstack trace issue is indeed solvable. Showing the value of\r\narguments to inlined functions is another problem entirely,\r\nand it's probably not worth the effort to solve.)\r\n\r\nIs there any other reason I missed?\r\n\r\nIf my assumption that //go:noinline is only used to solve\r\nthe stack trace problem is correct, I think introducing\r\n//go:noinline and make it generally available is just papering\r\nover the real issue.",
