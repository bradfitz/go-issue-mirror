Imagine instead if it were //go:inline , and trying to stop people from using that inappropriately.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, I will always favor an explicit comment-expressed directive over attempting to control the compiler by subtext.  We have \"noinline\" now.  We spell it \"switch {}\".  Is that documented?  Is that guaranteed to work in the future?  Is a random Go programmer going to know what that means, and leave it alone?",
