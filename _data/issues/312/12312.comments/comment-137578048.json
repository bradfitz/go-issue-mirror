Especially to e.g. \"noescape\"? We going to rename those to //go:internal_no_seriously_i_mean_it nowritebarrier?\r\n\r\nIt's a comment. Anybody is free to ignore it. And it's an inlining option... it should not change semantics of the program. If it did, we'd have a bigger problem. So nobody should ever want to use it anyway, as it can only make things slower.\r\n\r\nI think there's way too much discussion here (including this comment) for something trivial and internal-only which exists only to clean up some tests.",
