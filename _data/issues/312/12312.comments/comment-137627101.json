See e.g. this from fixedbugs/issue10441.go:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc bar() {\r\n\tf := func() {}\r\n\tfoo(\u0026f)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc foo(f *func()) func() {\r\n\tdefer func() {}() // prevent inlining of foo\r\n\treturn *f\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd with that, I'm giving up arguing for this. I thought it was a simple, unobtrusive, low visibility, low impact fix to an annoyance felt by people working on the compiler. It has ballooned to the point that it no longer feels worth the words.\r\n",
