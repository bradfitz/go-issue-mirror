If they did, it would just be part of the ResponseWriter interface.\r\n\r\nTo do this without hijack, just write to your ResponseWriter and use https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Flusher instead. Both http1 and http2 support Flusher (but you should still test for it and conditionally use it). There's no need to use a buffered writer. The http1 and http2 response writers are already buffered. (and any unbuffered one wouldn't need a flush)\r\n",
