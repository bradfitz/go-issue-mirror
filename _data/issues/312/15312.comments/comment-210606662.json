	"body": "Thanks, your solution works fine!\r\nI thought that besides flushing, without hijacking I wouldn't be able to disable chunking in the ResponseWriter and that SSE wouldn't work with chunking enabled.\r\nBut I was wrong in both cases: chunking is not recommended for SSE but allowed, and to disable it  all I had to do was to change the Transfer-Encoding header.\r\nSorry.\r\n\r\nAbout the docs I understand. I'm not saying that it is incorrect, I'm saying that it could be more useful.\r\nI don't choose a ResponseWriter over another, I just use the one that is given to me. If a feature depends on some specific ResponseWriter and I depend on such a feature I want to have an idea when it may not be available.\r\n\r\nI understand that use cases for Hijacker are limited but I'm glad you decided to document it, thanks.",
