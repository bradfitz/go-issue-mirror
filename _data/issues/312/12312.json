	"body": "We're thinking about adding a `\u003cgo:noinline\u003e` directive to help with testing.  Currently, if you don't want a function inlined, you add a `\u003cswitch{}\u003e` or a defer or other not-obviously-a-nop construct to the function.  We'd like to introduce a new directive called `\u003cgo:noinline\u003e` to mark such functions, as the old way depends on a consistent definition of nop-obviousness (which we probably don't want to commit to).\r\n\r\nWe particularly need this feature on the SSA branch because if a function is inlined, the code contained in that function might switch from being SSA-compiled to old-compiler-compiled.  Without some sort of noinline mark the SSA-specific tests might not be testing the SSA backend at all.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that once everything is running under SSA this directive will be less useful, but I think it will be generically useful going forward.  Thus I'd like to discuss this now in anticipation of it being merged into mainline sometime soon (if it is accepted).\r\n\r\nImplementation is pretty easy, https://go-review.googlesource.com/13911 if you're interested.\r\n",
