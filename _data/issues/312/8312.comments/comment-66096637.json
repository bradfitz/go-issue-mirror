I run one of the darwin\nbuilders, which is running os x 10.9.something, where something is whatever is the\nlatest that apple have pushed to this machine. There are no errors with the builder\n\nCould this possibly be a problem with your local machine ? Which version of Xcode are\nyou using, we pretty much assume you're running the latest available. Is there an\noddball version of clang (or gcc) in your path that the build process could be picking\nup ?\n\nAre you 105% sure that you do _not_ have GOOS, GOROOT or GOARCH set. These are not\nnecessary for building Go from source.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
