	"body": "When the preferred visual returned by EGL is different from the parent window's visual, a private colormap is needed in the call to XCreateWindow (see X server source code http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/tree/dix/window.c#n708).\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a known issue as some of the proposed fixes for other issues also include a fix for this (see for example https://github.com/capnm/mobile/blob/patch-1/app/x11.c#L49), but haven't seen it formally reported, so here it is.\r\n\r\n",
