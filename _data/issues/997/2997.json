	"body": "by **Kalthorn**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI'm not sure if this is something that needs solving but it is worth reporting anyway.  \n\nOn Windows, using \u0026quot;go get\u0026quot; to pull from a Google Code repository will fail if\nthe proper certificate isn't trusted by Windows.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nNone on the command line. The source from the repository should appear in my GOPATH or\nthe default location.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n(When attempting to pull from the codesearch repo):\n\ncode.google.com/p/codesearch/index: Get\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/codesearch/source/checkout?repo=\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/codesearch/source/checkout?repo=\u003c/a\u003e: x509: certificate signed by\nunknown authority\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows 7 64-bit\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nWeekly 02-07-12\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nUsing browser tools to export the certificate and adding it to Windows' trusted list\nsolved the problem.  Maybe in the future it could just use Mercurial's list since\ncloning from Google Code with Hg wasn't denied outside of the 'go' command.\u003c/pre\u003e",
