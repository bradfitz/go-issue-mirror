	"body": "by **sqweek**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n1. Make cgo calls to a C library that uses pthreads\n2. Make the library call pthread_cancel on one of its threads\nI created a small test case, available at \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/sqweek/signal32-bug\"\u003ehttps://github.com/sqweek/signal32-bug\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nThe thread is cancelled and the program continues running.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nThe program crashes with message:\nruntime: signal received on thread not created by Go: signal 32\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\ncgo/6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nLinux 3.12.0-1\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\nReproduced on both:\ngo version go1.1.2 linux/amd64\ngo version devel +f4d1cb8d9a91 Thu Sep 19 22:34:33 2013 +1000 linux/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nAccording to \u003ca href=\"http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_cancel.3.html#NOTES\"\u003ehttp://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_cancel.3.html#NOTES\u003c/a\u003e\npthread_cancel() is implemented via signals on linux.\n\nI tried changing signal 32's flags to 0 in pkg/runtime/signals_linux.h which fixes the\ncrash, but the program then hangs in pthread_join(). gdb reports the cancelled thread\nstill exists and is blocked (ie, \u0026quot;finish\u0026quot; never got anywhere) in\n__libc_disable_asynccancel():\n\nThread 5 (Thread 0x7ffff6010700 (LWP 12137)):\n#0  0x00007ffff7905aff in __libc_disable_asynccancel () from /usr/lib/libc.so.6\n#1  0x00007ffff78cab49 in nanosleep () from /usr/lib/libc.so.6\n#2  0x00007ffff78ca9d4 in sleep () from /usr/lib/libc.so.6\n#3  0x000000000040100e in threadfunc (dummy=\u0026lt;optimized out\u0026gt;)\n    at /d/code/go/src/github.com/sqweek/signal32-bug/thread.c:10\n#4  0x00007ffff7bc70a2 in start_thread () from /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0\n#5  0x00007ffff78f949d in clone () from /usr/lib/libc.so.6\u003c/pre\u003e",
