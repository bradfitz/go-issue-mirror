Using cgo to call into a library that\nends up calling pthread_cancel makes the go runtime exit immediately.\n\nThe fix, however, should be as simple as clearing signal 32's flags in\npkg/runtime/signals_linux.h, which causes the runtime to leave pthreads' signal 32\nhandler in place.\u003c/pre\u003e",
