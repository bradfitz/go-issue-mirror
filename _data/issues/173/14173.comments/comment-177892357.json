I'm also of the opinion that if the `map()` functionality you've prosed yields the same run time code/performance, then it's extra work for not a lot of gain. In fact it would simply be adding fluff to the language that's not needed.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is whether or not you want your language's grammar to include several different ways of doing the same job. I know I don't. I like the fact that a for-loop is the de facto means of looping over a slice.\r\n\r\nFinally, when I compare your for-loop example to the `map()` examples you've provided, I feel as though I'm looking at a comparison between C like syntax and JavaScript like syntax - I simply cannot stand the in-line function syntax (heavily) present in JavaScript and in your example.\r\n\r\n(Edit: grammar; spelling)",
