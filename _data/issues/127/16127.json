	"body": "As detailed in #15891 , `net/url` does not properly follow RFC3986 when encoding URL strings. Certain characters, such as `(` and `)` are URL-encoded when they are not required to be by the RFC.\r\n\r\nI propose updating the logic in `net/url` to allow for valid URL characters to remain un-encoded, possibly adding a new `case` statement for differentiating between escaping URL strings and encoding URL components.",
