	"body": "@mdempsky I agree that clearly strconv.ParseInt should not have to care about HTML quoting.  In retrospect I think it was probably a mistake for the error returned by ParseInt to include the input string.  That should have been left up to the caller, not made the default.\r\n\r\nI am not worried about callers who do proper HTML quoting, because no normal input to ParseInt is going to include angle brackets anyhow.  In any case, with my proposed change the error message simply won't contain any angle brackets, so any extra quoting done by the caller will most likely have no effect.\r\n\r\nThe report was for people using flash and Adobe reader plugins to Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\n@DisposaBoy Yes, of course the HTML reader is broken.  That is not in dispute here.  The error message is already quoted using strconv.Quote, so in my opinion adding some additional quoting will do little harm.",
