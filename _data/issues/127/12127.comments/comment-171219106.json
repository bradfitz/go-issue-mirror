I've been working on my own decimal library for a little while and it's mostly completed.\r\n\r\nIt's a \"big\" decimal type -- not decimal32, 64, 128, etc.\r\n\r\nMy current goals are:\r\n\r\n1. Finish comprehensive test suite (and iron out any bugs that pop up)\r\n2. Add proper support for scientific notation strings\r\n3. Figure out how I want to support NaN/Inf (currently panics but since it's a \"big\" decimal that's hard to do) in a nice way\r\n4. Minor optimizations (some parts are a bit naive)\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to rip it apart (or contribute) if you'd like. I'm a bit biased, but I believe it's a more proper library than some of the others out there. (Don't get me wrong -- I'm not knocking theirs, but the ones I've seen have to convert decimals to strings and parse the strings to do division or use cgo.)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/EricLagergren/decimal",
