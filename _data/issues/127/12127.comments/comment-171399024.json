	"body": "@kostya-sh Thank you!\r\n\r\n\u003e You use int64 for scale, I don't think this will work on 32-bit architectures.\r\n\r\n Could you elaborate why? If there are issues (I haven't tested on 32-bit platforms yet) using `int` would probably work fine.\r\n\r\n\u003e I think some methods are unnecessary, like Fib or Binomial. I would use a big.Int-based library for them.\r\n\r\nI added Fib (and, obviously, FizzBuzz) just for the fun of it :smile: \r\n\r\n\u003e MarshalJSON and UnmarshalJSON are not needed. MarshalText/UnmarshalText are enough\r\n\r\nI  still need to nail down this part of the library, although it should be easy enough.",
