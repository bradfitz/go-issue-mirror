	"body": "I had a quick look at shopspring/decimal code. It is a useful library and the fact that it is used in production proves that it provides enough functionality for common use cases. However for edge cases the results can be surprising:\r\n\r\n- `decimal.New(1, -100000000).Cmp(decimal.New(-1, 0))` will take forever to finish and will use a lot of memory\r\n- `decimal.New(1, 0).Div(decimal.New(1, 100))` is 0. DivisionPrecision =16 and is global.\r\n\r\nSome important functionality is missing as well:\r\n\r\n- no support for different rounding modes for Div\r\n- no support for fixed precision decimals\r\n- no support for string conversion to exponential notation\r\n- no support for Infinity or NaN (this can be considered a feature though)\r\n\r\n",
