	"body": "@EricLagergren, this looks great. If you need data for the comprehensive test suite feel free to reuse some of the tests that I've created for https://github.com/kostya-sh/go-decimal-proposal (based on the test cases from http://speleotrove.com/decimal).\r\n\r\nIn particular you can take a look at https://github.com/kostya-sh/go-decimal-proposal/tree/master/dectest - a small program that can generate go files with test tables from http://speleotrove.com/decimal/dectest.pdf. You will have to modify it to support more operations though.\r\n\r\nA few comments:\r\n- You use int64 for scale, I don't think this will work on 32-bit architectures.\r\n- It would be good to add support for `fmt.Printf` (for `%s` and `%d`), fmt.Scanf\r\n- I think some methods are unnecessary, like Fib or Binomial. I would use a big.Int-based library for them.\r\n- MarshalJSON and UnmarshalJSON are not needed. MarshalText/UnmarshalText are enough\r\n",
