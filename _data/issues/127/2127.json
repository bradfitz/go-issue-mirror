Print out the results of LocalAddr\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n2011/08/03 11:28:15 have connection with LocalAddr(): 127.0.0.1:54321\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n2011/08/03 11:28:15 have connection with LocalAddr(): 0.0.0.0:54321\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nGNU/Linux\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n3c21f37b25a3+ weekly/weekly.2011-07-19\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nLocalAddr() does not respond with what is expected.  I have attached the server to\ndemonstrate this.  You can connect to the server with nc \u0026lt;ip\u0026gt; 54321 and it will\nprint out what IP address it believes is connecting from. \n\nI have also attached a patch file for the net pkg.
