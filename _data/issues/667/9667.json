	"body": "The API for ReadAt does not allow end of reader offset, presumably because of its relationship to pread(2). This makes ReadAt for reading an end-defined file segment require additional support to determine the total size of the data held by the reader. In the case of an *os.File, this can be done via Stat. In the case a bytes or strings Reader there is no equivalent (though see workaround at [1]).\r\n\r\nI would like to see a Size method on these two types. In both cases this is merely requires returning the len of the stored string or []byte.\r\n\r\nIf this is acceptable I am happy to send a CL.\r\n\r\n[1]https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/nskyzVABsX8/discussion",
