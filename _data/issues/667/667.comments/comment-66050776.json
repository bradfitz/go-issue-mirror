Though it probably needs some\nwork to clean up the code.\n\nSecondly - I think it's clearer to look at the more general perspective of the problem -\nit arises when you declare a type literal which copies the contents of a type in which\nitself is referenced to via a pointer. Ok, probably clearer via examples. The simplest:-\n\ntype Foo struct {\n        next *Bar\n}\ntype Bar Foo\n\nWhich raises the compiler error 'invalid recursive type Bar'\n\nNow, (prior to the patch), if you actually declared this as follows:-\n\ntype Bar Foo\ntype Foo struct {\n        next *Bar\n}\n\nIt would compile fine.\n\nWe can actually extend this to a couple of other cases which cause further trouble when\ntrying to fix this problem:-\n\ntype Foo struct {\n        next *Bar\n}\ntype Bar Baz\ntype Baz Blah\ntype Blah Foo\n\nAnd something like this:-\n\ntype Foo struct {\n        next struct {\n                x *struct {\n                        y *****struct {\n                                z struct {\n                                        argh Bar\n                                }\n                        }\n                }\n        }\n}\ntype Bar Foo\u003c/pre\u003e",
