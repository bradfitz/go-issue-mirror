	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWe need some way to catch people running C functions on Go stacks.\nOne possibility is to add g-\u0026gt;stackguard1, checked by the prologue in C functions\ninstead of g-\u0026gt;stackguard0.\nOn a g0 stack, g-\u0026gt;stackguard1 would be g-\u0026gt;stackguard, but on a g stack,\ng-\u0026gt;stackguard1 would be ~0.\nThat would make every C function check that it's not running on the g stack, at no extra\ncost.\nIn newstack we'd need some way to identify that the function trapped because it is in C\nand throw\nwith an appropriate message.\u003c/pre\u003e",
