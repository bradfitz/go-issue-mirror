They are never run, of course, since you're\nnot on an ARM system, although they could be moved to an arm system and would run\ncorrectly there. We could add more complexity to cmd/go and the build to avoid building\nthe cmd/ things, but it's nice to know that they build correctly and not too terrible\nthat they are installed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
