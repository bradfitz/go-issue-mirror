	"body": "BTW: A file that uses import \"C\" is not necessarily a well formed Go source file.  Aside from the issue of the unreferenced package name, in cgo files, references to unexported package members like C.int are allowed, and calls to functions act as if overloaded to have two variants, one that returns two results, the second being the value of errno.\r\n\r\nSo from the tool designer's perspective, files that import \"C\" behave like a different language that requires preprocessing to create Go code.\r\n\r\nHave you tried using the golang.org/x/tools/go/loader package?  It takes care of loading a complete Go program from source.  It does cgo preprocessing as needed.\r\n",
