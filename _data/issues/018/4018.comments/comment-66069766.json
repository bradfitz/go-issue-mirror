I read all 496 open bugs today in order so this\nis one of the last ones I processed. In my defense I don't think the new summary is that\nmuch more snarky than the original \"Spec is inconsistent and/or unhelpful about\niteration differences between string and []byte\".\n\nTo answer your question...\n\nI think it is okay to say that \"Strings behave like slices of bytes but are immutable\"\nwithout also listing all the other ways in which they differ. Referring to the range\nstatement here seems odd since it hasn't been introduced yet, and the range section does\nsay explicitly:\n\n1. For an array, pointer to array, or slice value a, ...\n2. For a string value, ...\n\nI am sure there are other ways in which string and []byte are different that we are both\nforgetting. For example, you can have constant strings.\n\nHowever, I am leaving this open for gri. I was just trying to shorten the summary and\nput it in the usual form.\u003c/pre\u003e",
