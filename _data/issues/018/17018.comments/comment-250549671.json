More specifically, I believe the list on /doc/install under supported systems is the master list of first-class ports. I have certainly edited that list in the past with that in mind.\r\n\r\nWe have in the past agreed to put up binaries for other ports, but we should do a better job of clarifying them on the download page as not officially supported.\r\n",
