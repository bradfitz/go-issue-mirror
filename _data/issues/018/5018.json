(Not a dot file!) \nI've been putting build tags in every file but it's tedious, error-prone, requires\nconstant maintenance, and only works by luck, really, due to an interaction of the\npresent tool's rules and build tag syntax. We need a better way that will work in other\nversions of this situation.\u003c/pre\u003e",
