Our installation instructions tell people to place the contents in `/usr/local/go` and not owned by their own username. \r\n\r\nWe strongly discourage people from placing the contents elsewhere as that raises the spectre of GOROOT. \r\n\r\nI agree that these scripts should be stripped from the MSI and PKG installers. I think they should also be stripped from the zip and tar distributions.\r\n\r\nIf people want to install from source, they should check it out from git or use the source tarball. All the rest of the mechanisms should not be useable as proxies for the source tarball.",
