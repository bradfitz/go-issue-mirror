	"body": "I looked back at the 1.3.3 code.  The bug happens with channels of size 0 where the size of the type is larger than the channel header (on 64 bit, 88 bytes).  There's an underflow in the loop condition in heapdump.c:951 which makes the loop run ~2^64 iterations.\r\n\r\nAn easy workaround, and probably something you should do anyway, is pass large objects by reference.\r\n\r\nThis bug will not happen on 1.4 and beyond.",
