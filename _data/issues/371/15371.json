	"body": "See: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/x509/x509.go#L1136\r\n\r\nThe error returned when unmarshmaling a key-id reads `x509: trailing data after X.509 authority key-id`. However, this is not the authority-key id, it is the key-id. \r\n\r\nInstead it should read `x509: trailing data after X.509 key-id`\r\n\r\nIt looks like someone copied and pasted the error from here (https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/x509/x509.go#L1102) without making the needed change to the text.
