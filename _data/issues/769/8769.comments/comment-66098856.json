These should be\nunrelated directories, since 'go list', 'godoc' and other commands may enumerate\npackages by walking the directory tree from these roots.\n\nAlso, can you confirm that you built godoc from the release-branch.go1.3 revision, not\nfrom tip?  There have been recent changes to the organization of GOROOT and to the logic\nof godoc, so you must ensure that the tools and GOROOT are consistent.\n\nPlease let me know if this doesn't fix the problem.\n\ncheers\nalan\u003c/pre\u003e",
