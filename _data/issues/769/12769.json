Thanks.\r\n\r\nI am following up with one remaining step that should be done by @rsc for a merged CL https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/12192/. This is really really minor cleanup issue, but it should not take more than 1 minute for @rsc to resolve (and I just want to get it checked off from my TODO list).\r\n\r\nI will quote the CL conversation here for context:\r\n\r\n##### Dmitri Shuralyov\r\n\r\n\u003e Just in case it's at all helpful, I've rewritten the history as it\r\n\u003e should be with new import paths (\"github.com/rsc/go-get-issue-9224-{cmd,lib}\")\r\n\u003e and pushed that on \"rsc-import-paths\" branches:\r\n\u003e https://github.com/shurcooL/go-get-test-cmd/commits/rsc-import-paths\r\n\u003e https://github.com/shurcooL/go-get-test-lib/commits/rsc-import-paths\r\n\r\n##### Russ Cox\r\n\r\n\u003e \u003e Just in case it's at all helpful, I've rewritten the history as it\r\n\u003e \u003e should be with new import paths (\"github.com/rsc/go-get-issue-9224-{cmd,lib}\")\r\n\u003e \u003e and pushed that on \"rsc-import-paths\" branches:\r\n\u003e \u003e https://github.com/shurcooL/go-get-test-cmd/commits/rsc-import-paths\r\n\u003e \u003e https://github.com/shurcooL/go-get-test-lib/commits/rsc-import-paths\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e Thanks.

Its \"master\" branch should be set default (in GitHub repo settings at https://github.com/rsc/go-get-issue-9224-cmd/settings) and \"work\" branch can be deleted.\r\n\r\n##### Dmitri Shuralyov\r\n\r\n\u003e Just checking in here, the above followup step is still not done.\r\n\r\n# Issue and Resolution\r\n\r\nThe issue is that Russ Cox has pushed the changes to the repo, but the branch he pushed to is not the default branch.\r\n\r\nThe resolution, as I commented above, is:\r\n\r\n\u003e But https://github.com/rsc/go-get-issue-9224-cmd still has the wrong default branch \"work\". Its \"master\" branch should be set default (in GitHub repo settings at https://github.com/rsc/go-get-issue-9224-cmd/settings) and \"work\" branch can be deleted.\r\n\r\nNote that `go get` ignores the default branch set on GitHub, so `master` is used anyway. But it can be confusing to see the wrong default branch in the github repo.",
