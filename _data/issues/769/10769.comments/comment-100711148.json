In the template context is the `Site`. `Site` has a list of `Pages`; each `Page` has a reference to the `Site` it belongs to.\r\n\r\nSo a person does this in a template (https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1123):\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u003cscript\u003e\r\n{{ .Site }}\r\n\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\nAnd BAM! \r\n\r\nI would agree that this usage is \"pathological\", but people do stupid (and some do evil) things. \r\n\r\nAnd from Hugo's point of view, to fix this, we must remove the circular reference from `Page` (and maybe some other), but that would make the software useless.",
