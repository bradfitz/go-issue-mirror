It was definitely alive, it was just passing a pointer to a stack value now\ninstead of a heap-allocated value. And on 32-bit systems uintptr is only 4 bytes but the\nkernel wanted (and wrote) 8. It only worked before because if you asked the memory\nallocator for 4 bytes you got at least 8 anyway.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Fixed**._",
