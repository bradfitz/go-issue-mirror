There are two answers:\n\n1) append does not make any guarantees for overlapping operands (status quo explicitly\nspelled out).\n2) append does \"the right thing\" (like copy) for overlapping operands.\n\nIf we spell out 1), users may still rely on the concrete behavior of a particular\nimplementation (which may happen to do 2). If a another implementation behaves\ndifferently, it will lead to very hard to find bugs. Thus, I am inclined to spell out 2).\u003c/pre\u003e",
