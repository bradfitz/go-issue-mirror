I don't see how we can\nreasonably expect Ticker to reliably deliver ticks on a 1ns interval.\n\nIf I am receiving 1 tick, then sure, there is no choice but wait for what OS will deal\nus. But if I am receiving 100 ticks from the Ticker, surely we could return immediately\nif Ticker time is up at the start of second (or third or ...) receive.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
