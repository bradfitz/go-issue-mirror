	"body": "I don't know too much about lzw, but comments say that the litWidth value controls the \"number of bits to use for literal codes\". Thus, if the value is set to 2, doesn't that mean you can only encode the literals 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, and 0x03?\r\n\r\nIn fact, this seems to be what's happening since the above code works when uncomp is set to \\x00, \\x01, \\x02, or \\x03. It also seems that the incorrect output value is the input value modulo 4.\r\n\r\nIf the encoder/decoder is working properly, maybe Write should output an error if the user tries to encode data with literals that are too large? In the horrendous off-chance that other formats depend on this degenerate behavior, then the library should at least document it?",
