What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nUbuntu 16.04 Xenial - Linux, amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/zbRIyl8apl\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI expected the function `toupper` to be passed as an argument to `map` and for the output of the program to be like this one https://play.golang.org/p/S8LsA-o5KX\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n```text\r\ntemplate: :1:10: executing \"\" at \u003ctoupper\u003e: wrong number of args for toupper: want 1 got 0\r\n```\r\nIt seems like `toupper` is evaluated as soon as it's seen, which breaks because it's meant to be an argument to the `map` function.\r\n",
