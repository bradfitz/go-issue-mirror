Supporting their serialisation seems counter to this.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of other cryptography packages in Go who's use is discouraged. https://github.com/golang/go/issues/14395\r\n\r\nIt's a bit unfortunate that after Microsoft made an effort to add pkcs12 to x/crypto, they are left forking it to support writing, which will likely leave x/crypto outdated compared to a more complete implementation elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn my particular case, Apple appears to be moving away from pkcs12 certificates, at least in the case of push notifications, so I don't have a strong argument to support them.",
