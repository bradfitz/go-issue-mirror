	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\ngo1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nPlayground, also reproduced on\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/fjDUgnco1F\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nA type has definite members. If a member is being requested that does not exist for that type the template should return a no type found error, even if the value of the type is nil.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nExecuting a template with a typo on a nil struct gives the misleading error that the struct is nil. This is true but the real error is that no member can be found.\r\n\r\ntemplate: tmpl:1:2: executing \"tmpl\" at \u003c.Get\u003e: nil pointer evaluating *main.outer.Get\r\ntemplate: tmpl:1:2: executing \"tmpl\" at \u003c.Get\u003e: Get is not a field of struct type struct {}\r\n",
