	"body": "When using `x/net/html` to parse a HTML Spec to generate Go code in the [colornames](http://godoc.org/golang.org/x/image/colornames) package, we wrote several [useful and fairly generalised functions](https://github.com/golang/image/blob/master/colornames/gen.go) to interact with HTML parse trees such as a generalised node matching function type, match function generators for nodes by atom type \u0026 attributes and functions to recursively search and find matching nodes in the parse tree.\r\n\r\nI have since then found these functions very useful in several other projects when using the experimental HTML parser. Therefore I was wondering if there is merit in providing these types of functions as a `parseutils` sub-package in the experimental repo. Happy to work on it.",
