	"body": "When profiling the reproducer for #14406 with \"go version go1.6 linux/amd64\", stack shrinking off, and numactl disabling memory migration, I see calls to `runtime.gcMarkRootCheck` on 12% of the stacks that include `runtime.gcMark`. The comment for the function indicates that it's for debuggingâ€”is that for producing higher-quality bug reports if there's memory corruption or incorrect GC behavior in production releases, or for debugging while writing the GC?\r\n\r\n@aclements \r\n",
