It does not enforce every single detail of a program.  Besides not inserting or\nremoving blank lines, it also does not remove line breaks in the middle of expressions,\nnor does it reformat comments.\n\nThe primary goal of gofmt, which I believe has been achieved, is to prevent arguments\nabout minor details of coding style.  It is not necessary to turn every input parse tree\ninto the exact same output file to meet that goal.  For example, this is the first\nmessage I can recall questioning the handling of blank lines.\u003c/pre\u003e",
