Go\nprogrammers should keep their own coding styles? The main reason of using gofmt is to\nenforce a unique style across all the go programs. That means no matter which style the\nsame program is using, gofmt should output the same code. However, the current gofmt\nallows the same program to have different style(one may add blank lines somewhere, while\nothers not), which is clearly not working in a way matching the original intention of\ninventing gofmt.\u003c/pre\u003e",
