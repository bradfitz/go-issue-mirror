The current \"gofmt\" program does enforce something\nabout multi-line formatting (related to blank lines). If there is no blank line after\n\"package\" or \"import\", it would add one after each of them. If there are two or more\nconsecutive blank lines, it would leave only one of them. If the current \"gofmt\" program\ndoes look at the above problems, I think blank lines are not minor details of coding\nstyle.\u003c/pre\u003e",
