I previously thought that means no blank line is used in the functions\ninside the standard library.\nI see the difficulty now.\nHowever, I believe one may add a comment (or even a blank comment) for a meaningful\nclosely-related code block for automated formatting. It is possible to improve \"gofmt\"\nas a better automated tool while allowing one to group closely-related code.\nOf course it would lose some minor, hidden information (of what are closely-related) if\nwe run the new \"gofmt\" for all the codes inside the standard library, but most go\nprogrammers would be happy to have a tool that could format their code automatically.\nThere are certainly some people like me, only group closely related code by using\ncomments, think that blank lines are used only for better appearance and use styles\nsimilar to me. The bottom line is that code written by different go programmers would\nprobably be in different styles without a new \"gofmt\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
