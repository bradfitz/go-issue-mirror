The compilation pass because the\nMakefile relies on the GOOS environnement variable which exclude the compilation of\nenv_unix.go and env_windows.go at the same time.\nGodoc don't rely on GOOS and generate documentation for all go files in the os package.\n\nSince the two variables have the same name and the same value, the result is visualy a\nduplication of line.\nWe can either modify the comment to explicit the visual duplication\nor maybe the fast fix is to move the declaration in a common place like env.go (see\npatch).\n\nThere is another example in pkg/path where the Constants block in godoc seems pretty\nmuch the same. The values differs.\n\nPerhaps the template on which godoc is based on, should specify the originating file\nnear each declaration?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1156/3/os_fix1156.diff\"\u003eos_fix1156.diff\u003c/a\u003e (1392 bytes)",
