	"body": "I ran into this as well, and I had a hard time figuring out if this was a bug or intended behavior, because when I tried to find documentation for template redefinition, I couldn't. It seems to be mentioned in passing on https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#hdr-Actions and nowhere else:\r\n\r\n\u003e The typical use is to define a set of root templates that are\r\n\u003e then customized by redefining the block templates within.\r\n\r\nGlad to see it was indeed a bug and is already fixed.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Actually, what I ran into may be slightly different (but definitely related). I'll have to test to see if it has been fixed by this change on `tip`.\r\n\r\n**Edit 2:** Not fixed on `tip`. Filed #16913 for my issue with reproduce steps.",
