But if this is considered, would it be possible to use some sort of prefix char to denote this package is provided by the build tool. `\"*Java/java/lang\"`\r\n\r\nRational: currently package tools need to understand special packages like \"C\". While it wouldn't be the end of the world to add other common special cases (starts with \"Java/\" or \"objc/\") it might be worth adding a convention for them.\r\n\r\nIf this was generalized:\r\n```\r\nimport (\r\n    \"*C\"\r\n    \"*Java/java/Object\"\r\n    \"*appengine\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n",
