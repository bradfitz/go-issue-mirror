	"body": "For overloaded methods, I disagree with having two different methods for determining the name. The first method of appending number of arguments is simply deficient for handling a number of cases and should be discarded.\r\n\r\nI think the full bytecode name of the object appended is overkill but can't confirm otherwise. I think the likelihood of an overloaded method that has positional arguments with the same class name but different namespaces is simply nonexistent.\r\n\r\n`Intent` has a long list of overloads for `putExtra`. The first argument is always a string with the second argument differing. Using only the differences for distinguishing overloaded methods, one could derive more friendly names, `putExtraString`, `putExtraInteger`.\r\n\r\nStill, that's short-sighted and I think it'd be worthwhile to list out all the overloaded methods from android.jar to see what kind of cases can be expected instead of assuming worse-case with use of bytecode names.",
