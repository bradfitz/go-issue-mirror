	"body": "I would like the x/text/encoding/unicode package to be complete with support for the UTF-32 encoding.\r\n\r\nI am filing this issue in accordance with the [contributing](https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html) document, and have already begun writing an implementation of the encoding here: https://github.com/PhilipBorgesen/golang-text/blob/master/encoding/unicode/unicode.go.\r\n\r\nMy current approach to the API is:\r\n- Port the UTF-16 API and make a UTF32 function, reusing the BOMPolicy and Endianness types. No RFC seems to exist for UTF-32, so make the UTF-32 implementation behave similar to the UTF-16 implementation for the sake of consistency.\r\n- Add the UTF-32, UTF-32BE and UTF-32LE encodings to the 'All' slice.\r\n\r\nCurrently I haven't updated the BOMOverride function as its comments say that it shouldn't support UTF-32 by default.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
