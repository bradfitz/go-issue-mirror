I know use of the UTF-32 encoding is rare but would like my processing to be robust against the odd UTF-32 encoded file which could come by.\r\nI could easily implement the encoding in a private module but thought I wasn't the only one missing this functionality, for which reason I am offering to add it.\r\n\r\nI was not aware that UTF-32 had security-related issues.
