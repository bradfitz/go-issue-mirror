	"body": "After an hour of head scratching and cursing and found that there's a strange way how ServeFile handles any path's that end with `index.html`:\r\n- Instead of serving the file directly it generates a 301 redirect response to the nearest folder\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nhttp.ServeFile(w,r,\"/public/blog/index.html\") \r\nthis redirects to `/public/blog/` \r\n\r\nThis is not mentioned in the documentation and could cause undesirable behavior.\r\n\r\nI tried to add the note about it to the documentation but got rejected because apparently Go doesn't use Github's pull request system. So I don't know how to get this into the documentation so that others won't get tripped over it.\r\n\r\nI would actually propose that \"feature\" to be removed because it's based on an arbitrary of considering the trailing slash (\"/\") to be the equivalent of a reference to \"index.html\".",
