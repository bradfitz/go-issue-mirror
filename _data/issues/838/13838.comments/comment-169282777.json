And it's trivial to implement.\r\n\r\n2. The original issue with setuid() and setgid() is very hard and ugly to fix because it needs some kind of signalling mechanism and support within all threads for these changes, just the way libc does it. My suggested additions to runtime are way easier because they only affect future threads.\r\n\r\n3. If all 3 runtime functions I suggest are added, this would allow writing Go programs that are secure and portable with no need for cgo.",
