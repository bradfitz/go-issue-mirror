	"body": "by **frederic.bonfanti**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eAbstract\n\nProposing a POSIX target platform might ease several pending ports at least in terms of\nunderstanding the deep insights of \nthe GO toolchain.\n\nInferno OS, in its hosted versions, used to implement POSIX calls for some part of the\nlow level APIs, thus making it \nstraightforward to port the EMU (VM) to new platforms. Later on, one could decide to go\nfor native / proprietary APIs \nwhenever partial or complete optimization was relevant.\n\n\nWhat would be your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n\n POSIX / {arm,adm64,386}\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\n N/A\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nSome of the following POSIX features might be interfaced depending on minimal\nrequirements and forceable evolutions of \nthe GO language:\n\n POSIX.1, Core Services (incorporates Standard ANSI C)\n    Process Creation and Control\n    Signals\n    Floating Point Exceptions\n    Segmentation Violations\n    Illegal Instructions\n    Bus Errors\n    Timers\n    File and Directory Operations\n    Pipes\n    C Library (Standard C)\n    I/O Port Interface and Control\n    Process Triggers\n\n POSIX.1c, Threads extensions (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995)\n    Thread Creation, Control, and Cleanup\n    Thread Scheduling\n    Thread Synchronization\n    Signal Handling\n\nThe following operating systems being 100% POSIX compliant, they would immediately\nbenefit from such a target platform \nfor the GO language:\n\n    A/UX\n    AIX\n    BSD/OS\n    DSPnano\n    HP-UX\n    INTEGRITY\n    IRIX\n    LynxOS\n    Mac OS X\n    MINIX\n    MPE/iX\n    QNX\n    RTEMS\n    Solaris\n    Unison RTOS\n    UnixWare\n    velOSity\n    VxWorks\n\nTechnologies that might become of interest:\n\n    UWIN from the AT\u0026amp;T Research implements a POSIX layer on top of the Win32 APIs.\n    Plan 9 from Bell Labs APE - ANSI/POSIX Environment\n    Symbian OS with PIPS (PIPS Is POSIX on Symbian)\n    Windows NT kernel when using Microsoft SFU 3.5 or SUA\u003c/pre\u003e",
