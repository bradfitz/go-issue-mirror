I'd prefer to not fix the go test problem in a way that makes doing that\nimpossible, as it may uncover bugs that few people care about now or in the future.\n\nThe RunFromMain interface is both simple to implement, and simple to use. With it, I\nwill offer a function that may be called as:\n\nfunc init() {\n        qml.SetupTesting()\n}\n\nand then tests can just use the qml package as usual, for example.\u003c/pre\u003e",
