(e.g. critical bugfixes\nwith no workaround available; and for godoc, this condition is even less likely to be\ntrue than the main tree)\n\neven if we provide a tag for go.tools repository, it doesn't guarantee that you can\nget identical build every time with \"go get\" (for example, go.tools depends on go.net,\nbut we don't even have release-branch.go1.2 branch for the go.net sub-repository)\n\nIf you really want to do identical build, i think the best bet will be to record the\nexact revision for every dependencies, or distribute tarballs of required source code.\u003c/pre\u003e",
