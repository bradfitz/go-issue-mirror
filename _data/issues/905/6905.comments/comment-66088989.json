The MacPorts version\nwill likely be build many times because MacPorts packages (ports) are source based. If\nthe port refers to the branch any commit on the branch will break the build because of a\nchecksum mismatch. So if you could tag the revision which was used for the officical\nbinary distribution it would be much easier to bundle godoc and vet with the port. Or\ntag the current head, the most import thing for me is a reference to a specific revision.\u003c/pre\u003e",
