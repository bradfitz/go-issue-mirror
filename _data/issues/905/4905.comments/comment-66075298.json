If there are no pointers involved, Offsetof(obj.f) tells the offset of f in obj, not\nthe offset of f in obj.E.\n2. If there are pointers involved, Offsetof(obj.f) is a compile error.\n\nI think we can reasonably make this change. The current behavior is definitely wrong and\nwill lead to bugs when used.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **go1.1**, removed **priority-triage**, **go1.1maybe**._",
