	"body": "by **genial@alva.ro**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIt would be convenient to have goimports include the current package among the set of\npackages considered for importing; this would be useful, for instance, when adding test\ndata that was printed out with %v, etc. Offhand, it's hard to see any unintended\nconsequences, especially if the symbol is verified to exist in the current package.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n1. Go to \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/F9trflWOdJ\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/F9trflWOdJ\u003c/a\u003e\n2. Hit Format w/ Imports\n3. Compare formatted code\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n`package foo\n\ntype Foo struct{}\n\nfunc test() {\n\tf :=Foo{}\n}\n`\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n`package foo\n\ntype Foo struct{}\n\nfunc test() {\n\tf := foo.Foo{}\n}\n`\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nn/a\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nn/a\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nn/a\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nn/a\u003c/pre\u003e",
