	"body": "At least the naming of `ReadSeveralBytes` seems off to me since it makes it seem like I can pass in an integer like `1\u003c\u003c20` and it would return me a 1MiB byte slice. The documentation of `Peek` is clear that the method fails if the requested size is greater than the internal buffer. This is a subtle detail and I think the number of methods that `bufio` has with subtle conditions attached should be limited.",
