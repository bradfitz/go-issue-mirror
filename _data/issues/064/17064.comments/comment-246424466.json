But that requires a copy and you have to have a buffer to read into (or for you to allocate). If you need the performance and don't have a buffer handy, then use Peek + Discard.\r\n\r\n\u003e And I don't think, what library will be overwhelmed with this simple function, whose purpose is very clear. I think, what this function will be a good and logic addition to bufio.\r\n\r\nUsers who need this already can do it, using the function you already wrote. I don't think it needs to be part of the standard library. I think it would do more harm (cognitive overload, documentation clutter) than good (benefiting a few users, reducing their need to write a small function).\r\n",
