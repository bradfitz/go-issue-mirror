I think, what this function will be a good and logic addition to `bufio`.\r\nI am sure, that I'm not the only one, who needs similar method in standard library. And it's not so similar as other functions. `Peek` just peeks some chunk of memory, but doesn't advance the reader. `Discard` just advances the reader and doesn't return any memory slice. And this function will read several bytes and advance buffers. It's very easy to understand and I'm sure, what it won't overwhelm `bufio` library.\r\n@dsnet Yes, I agree, what the naming isn't good. We should think about a good name. \r\nI think, it should be noticed in documentation for this method, what the method fails if the requested size is greater than the internal buffer as you said and what user should always check the returned byte slice and error.\r\n",
