	"body": "\u003cpre\u003e--- Overview:\n\ntime.LoadLocation() on POSIX systems eventually uses loadZoneData() in zoneinfo_read.go\nto parse a zoneinfo file for timezone data. When the zoneinfo file doesn't contain any\ntimezone transition data -- see, for example, \u0026quot;Etc/GMT+4\u0026quot; -- this causes calls\nto Location.lookup() to return UTC times (line 104, zoneinfo.go).\n\nSince FixedZone() creates a Location with a single fake transition (line 86,\nzoneinfo.go), it seems like the \u0026quot;best\u0026quot; solution here is to do the same for\nzoneinfo files that are also fixed. I've attached a patch to this bug report, I'd have\nsubmitted it for review but mercurial on Goobuntu is Too Damn Old to run the codereview\nplugin :-/\n\n\n--- What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nAn example that *should* work is here:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/0OqoIdw3gk\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/0OqoIdw3gk\u003c/a\u003e\n\nUnfortunately play.golang.org doesn't have timezone data available. It works when 'go\nrun'\n\n\n--- What is the expected output?\n\nTime is: 2004-03-02 13:14:15 +0000 UTC\nTime in GMT+4 is: 2004-03-02 09:14:15 -0400 GMT+4\n\n\n--- What do you see instead?\n\nTime is: 2004-03-02 13:14:15 +0000 UTC\nTime in GMT+4 is: 2004-03-02 13:14:15 +0000 UTC\n\n\n--- Which compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\n\n--- Which operating system are you using?\n\nVarious debian-based linuxes (found the bug at home, reported it from work)\n\n\n--- Which version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo 1.0.2\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4064/0/patch\"\u003epatch\u003c/a\u003e (443 bytes)",
