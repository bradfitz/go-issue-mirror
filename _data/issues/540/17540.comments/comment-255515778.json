Ported applications developed on other OSes risk falling into a directory loop bug.\r\n- change the behaviour, in which case a particularly interested developer on Windows can detect junction points, decide about loop detection and issue another filepath.Walk if appropriate (just as a developer would on Linux with symlinks).\r\n\r\nFWIW I think the latter is better library default behaviour.",
