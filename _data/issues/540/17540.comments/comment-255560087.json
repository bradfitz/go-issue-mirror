	"body": "\u003e I wonder whether a higher level adjustment in filepath.Walk itself ... is better\r\n\r\nI considered that too. And I am not sure which approach is better. Like you said, unlike Unix, Windows returns both \"is directory\" and \"is symlink\" for some directory elements. Perhaps that confused authors of path/filepath.Walk - I suspect they did not consider that possibility.\r\n\r\nSo the question is, do we:\r\n\r\n1) want \"os\" package on Windows imitate what Unix does (os.FileMode to have either ModeDir or ModeSymlink, but not both)\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n2) accept what Windows returns for os.FileMode, and adjust all code outside of \"os\" package\r\n\r\n?\r\n\r\nI will let others decide here.\r\n\r\nAlex",
