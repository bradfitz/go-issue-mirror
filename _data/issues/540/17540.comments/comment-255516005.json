On the other hand it somewhat masks the fact that according to Windows the underlying object seems to be considered both a directory and a reparse point.  I wonder whether a higher level adjustment in filepath.Walk itself (and in #17541, a higher level adjustment in tar.FileInfoHeader) is better. I don't know - I think there's an argument either way.",
