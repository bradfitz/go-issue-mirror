Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1.

Run go vet on it\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nfoo.go:14: method UnmarshalXML(wrong int) should have signature\nUnmarshalXML(*xml.Decoder, xml.StartElement) error\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nfoo.go:10: method MarshalXML(e *xml.Encoder, start xml.StartElement) error should have\nsignature MarshalXML() ([]byte, error)\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThe MarshalXML signature it checks is that of the interface that was removed before Go\n1.0, UnmarshalXML isn't checked at all.\u003c/pre\u003e",
