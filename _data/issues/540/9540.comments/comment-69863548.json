	"body": "We don't know exactly what went wrong. We can't say that the custom import changed target, because maybe it was never code.google.com/p/go.net and you just happened to run an hg command to populate /Users/r/src/golang.org/x/net from there. We could suggest removing the directory and re-running go get, but that assumes there are no changes that need to be kept. I am always wary of tools suggesting that people remove directories: people will do it blindly.\r\n\r\nWe could make the error more explicit about the operations, saying\r\n\r\nimports golang.org/x/net/context: /Users/r/src/golang.org/x/net is **checked out** from https://code.google.com/p/go.net, **but golang.org/x/net** should be **checked out** from https://go.googlesource.com/net\r\n\r\nIs that enough to make the problem clearer?\r\n",
