Godoc could kick off an additional Walk when its\nVisitFile encounters a symlink'd directory. Or path.Walk could have an option to follow\nsymlinks. Or we could mandate that the goroot be intact and free of symlinks for our\ntools to work.\n\nTo solve this specific problem, why not make /usr/share/godoc/src a symlink to\n/usr/lib/golang/src ?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **a...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
