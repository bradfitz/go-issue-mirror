I guess an IPv4\nlimited broadcast address is considered as a non-local address on almost all the\nplatforms (except using some platform-dependent socket options such as IP_BINDANY). Also\nbasically socket has no concept of network interface or net/link adjacency (except using\nsome platform-dependent socket options) and also has no multiple address binding\nsupport. I guess that making your own DHCP transport stuff using wildcard (INADDR_ANY)\nsocket or using BPF/LSF linklayer tap like ISC-DHCP would be a solution for now.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
