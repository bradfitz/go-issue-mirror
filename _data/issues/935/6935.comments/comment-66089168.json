You can listen to [\"udp4\",\n\"0.0.0.0\", \"67\"] and deal with IP packet path by using incoming/outgoing IP interfaces.\nWell, a) socket is a simple tuple, b) it doesn't support multiple tuples, c) we need to\nspecify a specific address or wildcard address for controlling socket, d) ipv4 has two\nbroadcast addresses: limited and directed broadcast addresses, e) proposed\nListenBroadcastUDP doesn't fix multiple tuple issue, also not fix multihome (packet\npath) issue. Hm, I'm not keen on adding ListenBroadcastUDP but I may be wrong. If you\nthink that ListenBroadcastUDP is really useful, you can discuss at golang-dev, not here.\u003c/pre\u003e",
