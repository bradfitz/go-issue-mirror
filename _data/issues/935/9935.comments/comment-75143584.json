Checking the result of `strconv.Atoi` would have been easier than using strace.\r\n\r\nI don't think we can sensibly guard against sending bad arguments to system calls. There are so many system calls, and different kernels regardÂ different inputs as valid and invalid. The programmer should take care when making system calls.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue, but someone can re-open it if they feel differently.",
