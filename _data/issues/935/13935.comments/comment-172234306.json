This would increase this overlap and make it more difficult to decide what construct to use. It also doesn't seem to make the code shorter or clearer.\r\n\r\nThat is what the proposal/RFC is for I wanted to see other's points of view and know whether anyone might benefit from it. Though in other languages switches are supposed to perform better than if statements, though in this language they really do seem identical. I just don't see why there is a `fallthrough` which executes everything below *without checking validity* when there isn't some way to continue and only execute other things that are valid.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\u003eThis change would break existing programs, so it's hard to see it being adopted as is.\r\n\r\nTrue, if they have a switch in a while and then use a continue statement this will change the function of that continue and the owner will have to add a label to make it function as they previously expected.\r\n\r\nBut languages between versions have a lot of breaking changes and it's expected that you need to update code in order for it to work properly.\r\n\r\nThough I am open for suggestions especially alternative word suggestions so that this will *not* break that code.",
