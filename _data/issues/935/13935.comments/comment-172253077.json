While it's possible that there will some day be a Go 2, and that Go 2 may have some breaking changes, even then we will want to minimize them.\r\n\r\nThe `fallthrough` keyword exists mainly because that's how C/C++ switch statements work, and because everybody thinks Duff's Device is cool.  In retrospect we could have dropped `fallthrough` from the language and all would have been well.",
