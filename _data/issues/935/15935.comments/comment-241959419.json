So I think you can close this bug.\r\n\r\n\u003e I also don't want the implementation to be restricted to returning specific error variables over time, constraining the ability to refactor things.\r\n\r\nFor the record (not important; you can close this bug), I don't think this is a problem for the rule proposed above because an error is exported only if a knob exists in the public API. You're constrained to support that error for as long as you're constrained to support that API knob.",
