What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version devel +baec148 Wed Mar 23 14:21:15 2016 +0000 linux/ppc64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nlinux ppc64le\r\n\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nAs a result of some performance analysis it was found that some code generated\r\nas a result of plan9 asm does not perform as well as it could because the high use\r\nloops do not have the preferred alignment with respect to the icache.\r\n\r\nI have a change to add a new opcode(a directive actually) to indicate that the code stream should be aligned to a certain value at that point.  That way the directive can be inserted before a significant loop and allow the loop body to remain in the icache during execution resulting in better performance.",
