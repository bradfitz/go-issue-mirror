My personal opinion is that I would treat unused arguments of not\nexported functions the same as unused variables (and cause a compiler error).\n\nFor exported functions things are a bit different because of API stability reasons. A\nsimilar workaround to handling unused variables (\u0026quot;_ = unusedArgument\u0026quot; at the\nbeginning of the function) would be possible though and also enable documenting (via\ncomment) why a specific arguments is not used.\u003c/pre\u003e",
