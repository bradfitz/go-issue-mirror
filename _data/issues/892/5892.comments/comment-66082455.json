I believe we should always allow trailing commas.\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/11916045\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/11916045\u003c/a\u003e has a start, if anyone wants to pick it up. The\nonly problem is that the TrailingCommaSpaceEOF test is not getting the answer I think it\nshould, perhaps a bug that has been hidden by the comma paranoia.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **go1.2**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
