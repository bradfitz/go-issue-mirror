That was later changed to save all the data in the proto.\r\n\r\ngo tool pprof is based on an older version of pprof, which does not have that fix. At some point we will refresh the tool to use the new version. I already have that in my queue under #16184\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I recommend using the standalone pprof to collect the profiles.",
