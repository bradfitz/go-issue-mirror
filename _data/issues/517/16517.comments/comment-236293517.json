The docs for https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Parse say, in part:\r\n\r\n\u003e When parsing a time with a zone abbreviation like MST, if the zone abbreviation has a defined offset in the current location, then that offset is used. The zone abbreviation \"UTC\" is recognized as UTC regardless of location. If the zone abbreviation is unknown, Parse records the time as being in a fabricated location with the given zone abbreviation and a zero offset.\r\n\r\nI think that answers your question.\r\n\r\nBut if you want to discuss further, you should use the mailing list rather than this issue.",
