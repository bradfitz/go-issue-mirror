See #2775, #12186.\r\n\r\n2. Two packages from the same repo do not have to be related. E.g. `golang.org/x/net/ipv6 @ 0d2c2e17` and `golang.org/x/net/context @ 3b90a77d2` - both come from the same repo. If I tested my application with certain pinned revisions them updating these dependencies separately is safer.",
