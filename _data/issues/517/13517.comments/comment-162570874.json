While I develop on Glide this is less about my opinions (in this comment) and more I'd like to make sure to add contextually relevant information.\r\n\r\n* We currently have more than 5 specification files floating around the Go ecosystem. They exist today.\r\n* If we're going to use specification files to solve problems it's useful to know the kinds of use cases they they help solve. Some of us crafted a number of [use cases](https://github.com/mattfarina/pkg/tree/master/use_cases) to try and document these.\r\n* Most of the widely used and popular languages have package specifications. This isn't a new idea. Even Swift, which was just open sourced by Apple, as a spec of sorts. I know some Go developers aren't familiar with these so I wrote up [an overview of a number of these](http://engineeredweb.com/blog/2015/pkg-mgr-overview/). Of those looked at are both compiled and interpreted languages along with those that use dynamic and static typing.\r\n\r\nI do ask that anyone who jumps into the discussion on this with opinions take a little time to come up to speed on this space. Outside of Go the specs and tooling are a fairly mature topic.\r\n\r\nThis is also one of those topics with an impact on developer experience so it's worth looking at that as well.\r\n\r\nWhile I have my own opinions, which I will detail soon, if anyone has questions or pointers aside from my opinions I'm happy to inform. I'd like anyone who wants to discuss the topic to be well informed on the space.",
