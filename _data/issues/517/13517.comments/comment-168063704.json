I don't understand why that is implausible or an issue. If you are updating a vendored package why would you not also update its dependencies? It is the responsibility of the kit owners to make sure each commit does not break the entire kit of packages. \n\n\u003e On Dec 30, 2015, at 2:41 PM, Rob Figueiredo \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e \n\u003e @goinggo Does your position then say that packages within a repo should specify the acceptable versions of other packages within that same repo, rather than being able to assume they are all used at a consistent hash? If no, then it seems like an inconsistent position. If yes, then it seems implausible (since I can not imagine anyone ever doing that)\n\u003e \n\u003e In my opinion, repos that are a grab bag of unrelated packages are the exception, not the rule. Most multi-package repos are simply made to support a single functionality, and the extra packages are simply because some functionality requires a lot of code and packages are the way to organize a lot of code. For example, robfig/soy has a high level interface in the top-level package, but provides a lot of related tools and lower level functionality in the sub-packages. It would not make sense to have some of those packages at one revision and others at a different one.\n\u003e \n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n\u003e \n",
