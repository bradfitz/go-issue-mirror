It's a place to hold the projects from vendors rather than the place to put them within my VCS. I use [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) to fetch and manage what's in there.\r\n\r\nThe packages it checks out are in repos and everything checked out from a repo needs to be on the same version. The version being the same is important because different packages in the same repo being on different versions means there are untested combinations of code from the same repo, atomic commits have been broken, and there is no way to cleanly handle a shared dependency of multiple packages in the repo on different versions. This is a bad idea.",
