If I can fetch the current code, or any arbitrary revision after the one I have recorded, via vcs  then I have everything I need to determine compatibility (aside from a tool to do it). I do think people need to version their packages / repositories though as it will help a developer make a decision when that tool says that versions (or revisions if version information is missing) *1*, *2* and *3* are compatible, but *4* and *5* aren't because the public interfaces / structs / function signatures that the developers code is using have changed.\r\n\r\n",
