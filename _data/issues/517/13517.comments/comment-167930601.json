Either way, treating a repository as a kitchen sink to which a [meaningful versioning scheme](http://semver.org/) cannot be applied is a poor development practice. As @technosophos noted earlier, it constitutes \"level confusion\" - versions are a property of the repository, not the package. It should not, I think, be the target use case - merely one that is not disallowed.",
