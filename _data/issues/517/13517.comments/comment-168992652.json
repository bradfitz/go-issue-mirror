As an application developer I want to use a single repository for the application code and its client library (example: a database app and a client library to talk to this database). To build the application I want to use pinned versions of dependencies. For the client library dependencies I want to specify supported version ranges.\r\n\r\n2. As a consumer of a client library (e.g. from the use-case 1) I want to vendor only the client package without the application code.",
