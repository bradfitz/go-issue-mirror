You wrote \"I propose specifying a single file format that will describe packages sourced outside the project repository.\" That's the vendor-spec, right? Yes, we think there should be just one, but we really want the tool authors to converge semi-organically rather than mandate something. We've done a bad job here at mandating in the past (basically what I wrote in my last comment).\r\n\r\nBut then you wrote \"I also propose adding a packge to the golang.org/x/exp repository that discovers, reads, and optionally downloads third party packages.\" I don't know what this means. More detail needed.\r\n",
