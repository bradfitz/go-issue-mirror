	"body": "@crell, I'm not against version numbers, just ranges. Releasing to the default branch is still releasing and doesn't need to be associated with version numbers even. But I do like version numbers. I'm think it is a good idea to include them if available in a vendor-spec.\r\n\r\nDiamond dependencies: You example 2.4.{x,y,z}, which version do we use? When you go to update or add a package, right now my answer is to prompt the developer what to do. That may not be the right answer, but I would need to see data in go that that isn't.\r\n\r\nAll this said, I'm not against helping enable you use version ranges. It could be we have sufficient commonality we can have a net win here.",
