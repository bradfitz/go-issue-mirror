The current title says, \"Vendor specification\".\r\n\r\nWith that in mind...\r\n\r\n1. What use cases does the lock file file in this current state?\r\n2. Why is there a `RevisionTime` on each package? What use case does that help to solve?\r\n3. What use case(s) do the `comment` at the top and package levels support?\r\n4. What are your thoughts on extensions to the spec? For example, in Glide I have more data than this in those files that get into filtering, etc.\r\n\r\n_Note, I'm asking on 2 and 3 because they do not fit into the use cases I've previously worked out. Trying to understand the details._\r\n\r\nMy issues at a high level, and I'm sorry I have to be so brief as I have to go for now, are...\r\n\r\n1. This doesn't provide a solution to my [use cases](https://github.com/mattfarina/pkg/tree/master/use_cases). It's insufficient to automate package management.\r\n2. There is still a need for a package specification to capture relevant information.\r\n\r\nIn the goal to solve what's needed for package management for the majority of developers or is it to do one small slice of the puzzle that others still need to build on?",
