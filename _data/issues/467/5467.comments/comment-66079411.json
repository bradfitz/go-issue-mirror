This has happened too. For that matter the same is true\n(though less common) for full email addresses.\n\nThe R= line is just a hint. It's also nearly useless because replying to a thread makes\nyou a \"Reviewer\" to Rietveld.\n \nA better fix for this would be for the codereview plugin to fetch the set of LGTMs, now\nthat that's available from the codereview API, and show the full email addresses there.\u003c/pre\u003e",
