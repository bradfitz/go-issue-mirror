Reading through C99, it seems to only require that objects and functions with external linkage need to have the same type across translation units (6.2.7), but I can't find anything per se that disallows for example \"typedef int foo;\" in one translation unit and \"typedef unsigned foo;\" in another (assuming they don't in turn lead to incompatible object/function declarations).\r\n\r\n(Not to say that cgo *needs* to support that.)",
