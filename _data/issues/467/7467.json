	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps reproduce the problem?\n\nI've been doing some tests here with a net/http server where the handler makes many\nrelatively small writes of binary data to the ResponseWriter. I am ranging over some\nkey-values with a LevelDB iterator, and writing a bunch of the values.\n\nThe underlying bufio.Writer's size is hard-coded at 4k:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/src/pkg/net/http/server.go#L433\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/src/pkg/net/http/server.go#L433\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWith this size, my throughput is about 65 MB/sec. Increasing to 64k gets me to 90MB/sec\nand a 1M buffer gets me to 140 MB/sec.\n\nThe throughput of writing net/http responses can be significantly improved by making the\nwrite buffer configurable.\n\nDiscussion here:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/OuFtcKEyGrg/VyKo_LqOhK8J\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/OuFtcKEyGrg/VyKo_LqOhK8J\u003c/a\u003e\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThe fix is two lines.\n\nGiven that there's still 173 Go 1.3 bugs open, I would implore you to let me send a CL\nnow rather than wait another 6 months. But anyway.\u003c/pre\u003e",
