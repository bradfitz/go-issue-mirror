	"body": "by **awreece**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThis is a feature request for an additional flag for compilation to create a sanitized\nor hardened binary. \n\nThis binary could include a number of features, espescially including:\n- fake paths (ala /go/root/\u0026lt;pkgname\u0026gt; instead of the real filename) \n- doesn't have stack tracing on panic\n- doesn't print faulting instruction, address on segfault\n\nThe existing pack tool allows you to strip prefixes from paths, but there's no option to\npass that through the go build tool chain. Furthermore, this doesn't disable printing\nstack traces, etc.\u003c/pre\u003e",
