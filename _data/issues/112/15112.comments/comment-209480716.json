The primary problem is that isAncestor(Eq) provides only a partial ordering, so you fundamentally need to look at all pairs to get a complete sort. And then you need to maintain the sort order as you remove elements, which is itself expensive. That's how I ended up at CL 21961. But I'd be delighted if you see something I didn't. :)\r\n\r\nReducing the number of values would be a big win. If you can reduce the number of Nodes, that'd help everyone, since compile time in general is at this point roughly proportional to the number of Nodes, for non-pathological files.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether stack addresses (or maybe a subset of them?) should be put in the constant cache. \r\n\r\n",
