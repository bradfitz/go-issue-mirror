I'm not saying to make this a default, just an option.\n\nAnd my only use case is for multi-pass command-line parsing. I ALWAYS want a bad flag to\nfail in the second pass. \n\nMy scenario in your world:\n\nSo one of the flags I need in the first pass is \"-debug\". Let's say the user fat fingers\nit and types \"-debg\". The debug mode won't be enabled because it won't be found on the\nfirst pass. No error occurs. The second pass happens with errors on and then says\n\"unknown flag -debg. No problem.\n\nOf course the existence of the flag makes it possible for people to shoot themselves in\nthe foot, but why would people enable it without legitimate reason? If it is off by\ndefault (which I believe it should be), then they would be consciously making that\nmistake. There are many ways a programmer can shoot themselves in the foot, but I\nbelieve there are legitimate reasons for it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
