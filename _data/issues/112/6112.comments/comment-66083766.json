I expected the flag\nto perform something, but I'm using the result of the command (to a file, redirected\nstdout) only few (painful/expensive) steps/pipe stages later. Only then I'm surprised\nthe action was not performed, because the flag I provided was ignored. In the worst case\nI've already deleted/overwritten/lost the original source data and cannot go back to\nsquare one.\n\nToday's scenario:\n\nThe command fails immediately with writing a problem to stderr and returning a failure\nexit code. This saves me from detecting the problem too late.\u003c/pre\u003e",
