It panics with a stack trace (also attached) that points to line 94, which is a call to the free function `addSibling` with parameters of two non-nil pointers. I verified that both the pointers and the addSibling value were all non-nil. This appears to be an impossible panic.\r\n\r\nEventually, I was able to track the bug down to an attempt to dereference a nil pointer in the `addSibling` function itself. The stack trace was confused.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nA stack trace that pointed to the actual location of the panic.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\nA stack trace that pointed higher up the stack.\r\n\r\n\r\n[gobug.zip](https://github.com/golang/go/files/473673/gobug.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
