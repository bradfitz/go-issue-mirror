	"body": "You could find out how much time is spent in the scheduler using Linux's perf. I don't think it is very much. If you find evidence to the contrary, that would be interesting and maybe merit doing something here.\n\nGC time is accounted because it is a quite significant fraction of overall runtime for many real programs, and it takes all the CPU for long periods of time (at least until Go 1.5). I am unaware of the same being true for the scheduler. The scheduler runs as lots of tiny operations separated by goroutine execution, so timing it could introduce significant overhead.",
