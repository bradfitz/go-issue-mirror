The problem is that when we spawn the new thread with clone(2), we\nwant it to fill in the new thread ID for us. I'm not sure what the semantics are of\ngetting the new tid. It looks like in 2.4 (I'm looking at 2.4.22 anyway), you get a\nnew PID back, even if you clone with CLONE_THREAD. We'd have to call getpid in the\nchild thread to figure this out. I'll see if I can put something together for you,\nand if it works, maybe we can figure out a way to get it in. I'm guessing it's\nunlikely though.\n\n--dho\u003c/pre\u003e",
