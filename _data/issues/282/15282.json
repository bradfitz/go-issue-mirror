	"body": "The auto-generation of the `syscall/z*.go` files is a mess.\r\n\r\nTheir generation depends on the headers installed on the host system, so nobody can reliably generate them without making a bunch of accidental unrelated changes.\r\n\r\nThis applies equally to pkg `syscall` and to `golang.org/x/sys/unix`.\r\n\r\nLet's use a Dockerfile in there and then run mkwhatever.{sh,pl,go} file in Docker, and then `docker cp` the auto-generated files out of the container back to the host.\r\n\r\nRecent chaos:\r\n- https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/21971/\r\n- https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/21582/\r\n- etc (basically any change)\r\n\r\nIt's less clear what to do about other Unix, like OpenBSD (https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/21797/, etc). @mdempsky? Jails? But openbsd is tricky for other reasons: #15227\r\n\r\nWindows seems to be fine.\r\n\r\n/cc @ianlancetaylor ",
