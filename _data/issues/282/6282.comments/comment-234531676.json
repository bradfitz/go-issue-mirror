One cannot write a type of [,*] (or something) that is an unknown dimensional slice.\r\n\r\nYou are correct that you cannot reshape a [4][4]T into a [,]T or [,,]T of arbitrary size. You can, however, reshape a [16]T into those sizes. \r\n\r\nA [4][4]T could be reshaped just fine, but\r\n````\r\nvar a [16][16]T\r\nb := a[:4, :4]\r\n````\r\ncould not be correctly reshaped. I don't see how to simply distinguish between those two cases.",
