But the way dimensions are passed, in an array, precludes any *runtime* decisions about the number of dimensions, is that right?\r\n\r\nSay I have a 16-element matrix in 4x4 and at runtime I'd like to reshape it into 2\\*8 or 2\\*2\\*4, depending on some other inputs. Since the reshaping dimension description is an array, not a slice,  I cannot readily do that.\r\n\r\nI presume this is due to the fact that the number of dimensions needs to be known at compile time to provide access index checks (just checking the number of dimensions would need to be shifted from compile time to runtime) and other checks and optimisations, I just wanted to know if I inferred it correctly.\r\n\r\nThank you!",
