Being able to call these codes directly is \r\na huge benefit for doing numerical work in Go (for example, the gonum and biogo\r\nmatrix libraries have options for calling a third party BLAS libraries for tuned matrix\r\nmath implementations)\r\n```\r\n\r\nto mention the new cgo-rules, even just to clearly show this proposal is aware of them.\r\n\r\n",
