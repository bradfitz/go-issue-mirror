That should guide the creation of\nidiomatic, compatible matrix libraries. Cfr. database/sql, which guided the creation of\nexcellent database drivers.\n\nThe image package already provides nice guidance on how to handle 2D matrices. It uses\ncontiguous underlying storage which is needed when passing to external libraries. I\nmodelled a matrix (storage) package after image, this is how it looks like:\n\u003ca href=\"http://godoc.org/github.com/barnex/mat\"\u003ehttp://godoc.org/github.com/barnex/mat\u003c/a\u003e. However, many people wrote such kind of packages\nwith slightly different, incompatible, conventions. Hence it might be nice to have on a\nstandard convention in the standard library, once and for all.\u003c/pre\u003e",
