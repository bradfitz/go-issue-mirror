Without one it's difficult to understand the problem you are seeing.\r\n\r\nI trust you know that \\u0098 is a Unicode character that when stored as text will not be the bytes \\x00\\x98 but instead the UTF-8 encoding \\xc2\\x98. When you say \"ideally\" \\u0098 will become \\x00\\x98 you appear to be missing this point.\r\n\r\nTo put it another way, in a string \\uNNNN does not represent a byte, it represents the byte sequence necessary to represent the Unicode code point NNNN.",
