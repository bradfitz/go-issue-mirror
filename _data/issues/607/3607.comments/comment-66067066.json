You should\nget a message about a segmentation fault and another (gdb) prompt.\nType 'w' at this second prompt to get a stack trace from the compiler.\n Please post that stack trace here.\n\nThe compiler source files and line numbers in the stack trace are\nlikely to be enough for us to identify the problem.\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
