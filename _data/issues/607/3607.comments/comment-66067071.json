I have reproduced the problem with\n\n$ cat x.go\npackage p\n\ntype T struct {\n\t_ interface{}\n\tx interface{}\n}\n$ go build x.go\n# command-line-arguments\n./x.go:1: internal compiler error: fault\n$\n\nI can't imagine any benefit to having _ interface{} as a struct field.\n Why is it there?  As a workaround, if you remove those three fields,\nall will be well.\u003c/pre\u003e",
