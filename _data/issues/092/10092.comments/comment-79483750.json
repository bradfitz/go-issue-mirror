	"body": "I think the \"import cycle not allowed\" problem happens when gccgo sees packages that have the same name as packages in GOROOT.  Because gccgo has no GOROOT, it gets confused and thinks those packages are the ones in GOROOT.  That is, if GOPATH has a time package, gccgo thinks that is the package it is supposed to use for import \"time\", even though really it will use the standard time package.  This doesn't happen with the gc compiler because it sees the GOROOT time package and knows that one will be used first.  Since gccgo has no GOROOT, this does not happen.\r\n\r\nThe way that the go tool handles GOROOT needs to change when using gccgo.",
