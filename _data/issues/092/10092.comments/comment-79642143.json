Because gccgo has\n\u003e no GOROOT, it gets confused and thinks those packages are the ones in\n\u003e GOROOT. That is, if GOPATH has a time package, gccgo thinks that is the\n\u003e package it is supposed to use for import \"time\", even though really it will\n\u003e use the standard time package. This doesn't happen with the gc compiler\n\u003e because it sees the GOROOT time package and knows that one will be used\n\u003e first. Since gccgo has no GOROOT, this does not happen.\n\u003e\n\u003e The way that the go tool handles GOROOT needs to change when using gccgo.\n\u003e\n\u003e --\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/10092#issuecomment-79483750\u003e.\n\u003e\n\n\n\n-- \nJames Michael DuPont\nMember of Free Libre Open Source Software Kosova http://www.flossk.org\nSaving Wikipedia(tm) articles from deletion http://SpeedyDeletion.wikia.com\n",
