I don't know, if these interfere with your C variables. I don't\nknow what cgo does with your variables - it must rename them to something. You could use\n-x and -work flags when you build executable, then you will be able to have the exact\nsource that gets compiled. I would look at Go linker (cmd/ld/ldpe.c) to see what happens\nto all those symbols. Perhaps some can be renamed so we don't get clashes.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
