Channels are\nfirst-in-first-out.\n\nOf course in a specific program with multiple writers this is only meaningful if there\nis a relationship between the writers that ensures that the writes happen in a\nparticular order.  If there is no relationship, we don't know when the writes will\nhappen to the channel.  So the channel will still be first-in-first-out, but we don't\nknow what will be first-in.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
