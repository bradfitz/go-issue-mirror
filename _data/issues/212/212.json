To steal the syntax used by D for this purpose, we \nwould have:\n\nimport \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot; : Printf\n\nWith this, Printf would become a name within the file's namespace referring \nto fmt.Printf. The import would not insert any other names into the file's \nnamespace (not even fmt).\u003c/pre\u003e",
