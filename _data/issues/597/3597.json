But \u0026quot;GOARCH=arm\n./all.bash\u0026quot; will fail.\n\nThe package runtime/cgo is the only package requires ARM targeted gcc in this scheme.\nNow we can have 5a, 5g, 5l, but without runtime/cgo in the scheme of\n\u0026quot;GOARCH=arm\u0026quot;, thus we can't use 5a, 5g, 5l with ARM targeted cgo from in our\nhost like amd64.\u003c/pre\u003e",
