If your `GOMAXPROCS` is more than 2 the benchmark is going to be regularly discarding connections and opening new ones.  Each closed connection will be in `TIME_WAIT` state for two minutes, tying up that connection.\r\n\r\nTry adding this line to your benchmark:\r\n\r\n    \thttp.DefaultTransport.(*http.Transport).MaxIdleConnsPerHost = 100",
