By the time regexp sees it, it looks like:\n\n\"\u0026lt;[bBrR\\]\u0026gt;\"\n\nThen regexp thinks that you're trying to escape the closing ]. Try instead:\n\nregexp.MustCompile(\"\u0026lt;[bBrR\\\\\\\\]\u0026gt;\");\n\nThough the confusion is understandable, I don't think this can be considered a bug.\u003c/pre\u003e",
