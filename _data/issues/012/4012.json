What do you see instead?\n\nexpected: Tests run \n\nactual: \n% go build issue.go\n# command-line-arguments\n./issue.go:6: Not redeclared during import\n        previous declaration during import\n./issue.go:6: imported and not used: \u0026quot;code.google.com/p/gomock/gomock\u0026quot;\n\nAs it happens both gomock and gocheck define a function called Not, and as they are both\nimported locally, they conflicted. The name of the function didn't help, but that is not\nits fault.\n\nThe suggestion was to either quote the name of the function \u0026quot;Not\u0026quot;, or if\npossible give its full import path in the error message. The former sounds easier given\nthe offending line number is also available.\n\nPlease use labels and text to provide additional information.\u003c/pre\u003e",
