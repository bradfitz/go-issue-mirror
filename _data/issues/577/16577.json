What did you do?\r\n\r\n$ cd go/\r\n$ ./src/make.bash\r\n$ ./bin/go test -short runtime\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nTests run with ./bin/go\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nTests run with the first \"go\" in $PATH (in this case, the \"go\" on $PATH was broken, so the tests failed.)\r\n",
