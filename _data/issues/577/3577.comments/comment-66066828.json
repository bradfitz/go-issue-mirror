That's a distraction and has\nnothing to do with this bug.\n\nThe problem with your code is that you're assuming you can continue to use a base64\nDecoder after it's encountered a ReadError (an I/O timeout from SetReadDeadline). You\ncan not.  Once the base64 decoder hits a read error, the decoder is permanently busted. \nDon't set a deadline if you don't want one, or if you want to mask the read error, do it\nin a wrapped reader that you give to the base64 decoder.  Just don't like base64 see an\nerror.\n\nAnyway, this isn't a bug in the base64 code.\u003c/pre\u003e",
