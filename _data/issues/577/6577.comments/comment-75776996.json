	"body": "One problem with just adding a new function is that tokens don't have to be named. If you generate the parser for the example `expr` calculator found in `src/cmd/yacc/testdata`, you'll see that there is only one enumerated token:\r\n```go\r\nconst NUM = 57346\r\n```\r\nbut the slice of names includes all tokens:\r\n```go\r\nvar exprToknames = []string{\r\n    \"'+'\",\r\n    \"'-'\",\r\n    \"'*'\",\r\n    \"'/'\",\r\n    \"'('\",\r\n    \"')'\",\r\n    \"NUM\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHow would you \"look up\" token names? In this example, `NUM` has the value `57346`, and the value of each of the symbols is effectively its UTF-8 value (`43`, `45`, `42`, `47`, `40`, `41`, respectively).",
