	"body": "gapstone library (Go bindings to capstone) using cgo compiles fine with gc but not gccgo.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/aquynh/capstone\r\n$ cd capstone\r\n$ make\r\n$ make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go get https://github.com/bnagy/gapstone\r\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/bnagy/gapstone\r\n$ go build .\r\n(works)\r\n$ go build -compiler gccgo .\r\n# _/home/stalkr/github/gapstone\r\nIn file included from $WORK/_/home/stalkr/github/gapstone/_obj/_cgo_main.c:9:0:\r\n./engine.go:18:16: error: ‘trampoline’ redeclared as different kind of symbol\r\n/tmp/go-build286027823/_/home/stalkr/github/gapstone/_obj/_cgo_main.c:6:13: note: previous declaration of ‘trampoline’ was here\r\n```\r\n\r\niant's reply:\r\n\u003e The problem is presumably that there is an extern declaration of trampoline in the cgo comment and there is also an export of a trampoline function in the file.\r\n\u003e I'm surprised this works for gc and I guess it doesn't work at all for gccgo.\r\n\u003e I would guess that you can fix it by removing the declaration of trampoline in the cgo comment.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemoving the declaration https://github.com/bnagy/gapstone/blob/master/engine.go#L18 it fails to build with both gc and gccgo:\r\n```\r\n$ go build .\r\n# _/home/stalkr/github/gapstone\r\ncould not determine kind of name for C.trampoline\r\n$ go build -compiler gccgo .\r\n# _/home/stalkr/github/gapstone\r\ncould not determine kind of name for C.trampoline\r\n```\r\n\r\n(And removing the export https://github.com/bnagy/gapstone/blob/master/engine.go#L285 can't link because of undefined reference to trampoline.)",
