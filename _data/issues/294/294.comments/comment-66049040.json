Printing it \nshould print 4 strings (\"\", \"\", \"hello \", \"world\").\n2) StringVector (and IntVector) is not correctly initializing elements that are added\nimplicitly as part of a \nresize.\n\nWill fix this by changing the vector interface:\n- remove NewXVector since its parameter is confusing and new(vector.XVector) is a better\nidiom to use\n- rename Init to Resize with an extra capacity parameter\u003c/pre\u003e",
