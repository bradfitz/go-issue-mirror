	"body": "Yeah, your Go code is fine, and shiny is designed to handle multiple windows, but I'm not sure if the gldriver actually implements that yet or if it's just a TODO. There's certainly a TODO about it for the X11 flavor of gldriver (not to be mistaken for x11driver), and I wouldn't be surprised if some work remains on the Cocoa flavor. It's been a long time since I did any Obj-C / Cocoa programming, though, so I'm not exactly sure what needs doing, and what subtleties there are around trying to use multiple windows (and multiple OpenGL contexts). @crawshaw knows this better than I do, but I can't speak for when he will have any time to look at this.",
