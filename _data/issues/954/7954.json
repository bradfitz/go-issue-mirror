This makes the slides\nvery small, and puts a large blank area below the slides.\n\nIf I attempt to resize the page (via the two-finger resize gesture), I can attempt to\nfix this.  But eventually, while swiping the slides left or right, I'll hit the\nbeginning or end of the deck, and either the slide will be resized, or the current slide\nwill be partially off-screen.\u003c/pre\u003e",
