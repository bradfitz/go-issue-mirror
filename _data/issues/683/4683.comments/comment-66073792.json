I did find out what was causing the issue and it looks like maybe I pulled\n-release instead of -tip. \n\n6167 go_bootstrap CALL  #251 (obsolete rfork)()\n6167 go_bootstrap PSIG  SIGSYS caught handler=0x44655b mask=0\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\n6167 go_bootstrap RET   #251 (obsolete rfork) -1 errno 78 Function not implemented\n\nEven though I tried doing an hg up tip, and verified I was on tip, there must have been\nsome stale binary laying around that had that in it?
