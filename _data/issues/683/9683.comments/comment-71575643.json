	"body": "The problem is that if the uid/gid is bigger than 2^21-1 (that is, can't be\nepresented in 8 octal digits), archive/tar will use binary representation\nin the tar header.\n\nWhen using that extension, it uses \"ushar\\x20\\x20\" as header magic,\ninstead of the normal \"ushar\". However, according to GNU tar source,\nthe long file name will only be considered if it's TMAGIC (\"ushar\").\n\nBy always using \"ushar\" fixed the problem, and both GNU tar and BSD\ntar read the tar file correctly. I'm not sure why we're using\n\"ushar\\x20\\x20\"\n(OLDGNU_MAGIC) in the first place. It seems all tar readers can handle\nbinary-encoded uid/gid just fine with TMAGIC.",
