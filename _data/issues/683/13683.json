	"body": "https://golang.org/cmd/go/ since https://github.com/golang/go/commit/687925ffcf034b84029f646ea87f22eca5aeada5\r\nsays\r\n\r\n\u003e The meta tag should appear as early in the file as possible. In particular, it should appear before any raw JavaScript or CSS, to avoid confusing the go command's restricted parser.\r\n\r\nThis is not sufficient to have the parser work. The actual requirement is that the HTML page has to follow XML rules until the `\u003c/head\u003e` tag, or some such.\r\n\r\nHTML5 does not enforce `\u003chead\u003e`...`\u003c/head\u003e` to be used, and many HTML minifiers strip it out, leading to the same `expected attribute name in element` error from `encoding/xml` even if the meta tag is literally right after `doctype` and `title`.\r\n\r\n`go get chitin.io/chitin` fails because of this, because I used https://github.com/tdewolff/minify on it. Yet it's perfectly valid HTML5, and the meta tag is near the beginning.\r\n\r\nHere's a HTML5 validator being happy with a sample page (different url because /chitin is a 404, but it has the same meta tags):\r\nhttps://html5.validator.nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fchitin.io%2F\u0026showsource=yes\r\n\r\nThe HTML:\r\n```\r\n\u003c!doctype html\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eChitin â€“ gives structure to your squishy bits\u003c/title\u003e\u003cmeta name=go-import content=\"chitin.io/chitin git https://github.com/chitin-io/chitin\"\u003e\u003cstyle\u003ebody{background-color:#ffffea;display:flex;justify-content:center}body\u003ediv{flex:1}na ... and so on\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/golang/go/issues/8163",
