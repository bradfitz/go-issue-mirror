For example instead of returning ok, present, the\nfunction could just return the *Result  and then you could check r !=\nnil \u0026\u0026 r.OK in the test instead of present \u0026\u0026 ok. Doing that would\nmean you're holding the result and can log it as a reason to send the\nmail. In fact it would be nice to log the entire result string.\u003c/pre\u003e",
