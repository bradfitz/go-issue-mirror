Your Java program is just tokenizing the JSON, not building a\ndata structure. Go is actually building a data structure for you. So you are comparing\napples and oranges.\n\nA more equal comparison would be to have Go unmarshal into\n\nvar x struct{}\ndec.Decode(\u0026x)\n\nwhich will parse the JSON but throw away all the data. \n\nIn practice, you should be parsing into a real struct anyway. I think you'll find that\ncase is much nicer in Go than in Java, and probably competitive in speed.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
