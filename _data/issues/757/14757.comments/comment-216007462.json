But if the string does not come from outside\n(I/O), then it's still better to use []byte directly.\n\nCould you please given a real scenarios where you want\nWriteString support on a crypto.Hash while still care about\nthe utmost performance?\n\nWhile I agree that WriteString support on io.MultiWriter is fine,\nadding WriteString support to all io.Writer implementations\ndoesn't look necessary esp. if doesn't bring enough\nperformance improvement.\n",
