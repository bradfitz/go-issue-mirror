It only prints the message\nabout the PATH if the directory is not already in the path. I don't\nknow why it thinks the directory is already listed given what you\nshowed us.\n\nThe detail about 'The compiler is 6g' is no longer printed because the\ngo command makes it irrelevant. I will update the docs.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
