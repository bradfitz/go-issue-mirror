	"body": "Thanks @joeshaw. I created an implementation using the sentinel error for the `encoding/json` package and will start to work on the proposal in a bit. I think I'll focus primarily on this approach.\r\n\r\nThe [`Marshaler`](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/xml/#Marshaler) interface in `encoding/xml` is different from that in `encoding/json`, and seems as though a custom zero-value can already be established without needing to return anything special. Did you find that to be true?\r\n\r\nAfter I make a little more progress, I'll post a link to a branch in case you, @albrow or anyone else wishes to review and contribute.\r\n\r\nIf you have any additional thoughts or info in the meantime, please let me know. Thank you!",
