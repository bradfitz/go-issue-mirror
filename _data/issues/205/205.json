	"body": "by **vegard.nossum**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n1. Compile the attached file. This program launches two goroutines which\nboth write to the same channel (f() writes positive integers and g() writes\nnegative integers).\n\n2. Set GOMAXPROCS=1 and run the program.\n\n3. Set GOMAXPROCS=2 and run the program.\n\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\nOutput can be piped to a file and plotted using gnuplot:\n\n    $ 6g test.go \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 6l test.6 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; GOMAXPROCS=1 ./6.out \u0026gt; output.txt\n    \u0026lt;Ctrl-C\u0026gt;\n\n    $ gnuplot\n    ...\n    gnuplot\u0026gt; plot \u0026quot;output.txt\u0026quot;\n\nIn the GOMAXPROCS \u0026gt; 1 case, the goroutines run at approximately the same\nspeed, distributing the \u0026quot;time\u0026quot; difference (as counted in each goroutine)\nevenly around 0.\n\nIn the GOMAXPROCS=1 case, the output is always 84 or 86, meaning that f()\n(the first goroutine that was launched) is running faster than g(); about\n30% according to my calculations: in 256 ints sent over the channel, f()\nmanaged to increase its lead by 85 writes to the channel, and this happens\nevery time!\n\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n\ndeclare -x GOARCH=\u0026quot;amd64\u0026quot;\ndeclare -x GOOS=\u0026quot;linux\u0026quot;\n\n\nWhich revision are you sync'ed to?
