This was actually misleading me.\n- the 8.out process is trying to do the \"dialgoogle_test.go\n- www.google.com is no longer, at least from where I stand in the network, at\n74.125.19.99 (reverse nuq04s01-in-f99.1e100.net.) . It shows as 66.249.92.104 (reverse\npar03s01-in-f104.1e100.net) here...\n- The old address is taking forever to fail (more than 5 minutes with no failure printed)\n- When I run it with gotest -ipv6 it shows that ipv6.google.com address has also changed\nto 2a00:1450:8006::93 (again here)\n\nThe following trivial change, just switching both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses, makes the\ntest pass, and thus the whole build:\n\n$ hg diff\ndiff -r ca4f9687cec0 src/pkg/net/dialgoogle_test.go\n--- a/src/pkg/net/dialgoogle_test.go\tFri Oct 15 12:05:05 2010 +1100\n+++ b/src/pkg/net/dialgoogle_test.go\tFri Oct 15 14:21:53 2010 +0200\n@@ -40,17 +40,17 @@\n }\n \n var googleaddrs = []string{\n-\t\"74.125.19.99:80\",\n+\t\"66.249.92.104:80\",\n \t\"www.google.com:80\",\n-\t\"74.125.19.99:http\",\n+\t\"66.249.92.104:http\",\n \t\"www.google.com:http\",\n-\t\"074.125.019.099:0080\",\n-\t\"[::ffff:74.125.19.99]:80\",\n-\t\"[::ffff:4a7d:1363]:80\",\n-\t\"[0:0:0:0:0000:ffff:74.125.19.99]:80\",\n-\t\"[0:0:0:0:000000:ffff:74.125.19.99]:80\",\n-\t\"[0:0:0:0:0:ffff::74.125.19.99]:80\",\n-\t\"[2001:4860:0:2001::68]:80\", // ipv6.google.com; removed if ipv6 flag not set\n+\t\"066.249.092.104:0080\",\n+\t\"[::ffff:66.249.92.104]:80\",\n+\t\"[::ffff:42f9:5c68]:80\",\n+\t\"[0:0:0:0:0000:ffff:66.249.92.104]:80\",\n+\t\"[0:0:0:0:000000:ffff:66.249.92.104]:80\",\n+\t\"[0:0:0:0:0:ffff::66.249.92.104]:80\",\n+\t\"[2a00:1450:8006::93]:80\", // ipv6.google.com; removed if ipv6 flag not set\n }\n \n func TestDialGoogle(t *testing.T) {\ndiff -r ca4f9687cec0 src/pkg/net/timeout_test.go\n--- a/src/pkg/net/timeout_test.go\tFri Oct 15 12:05:05 2010 +1100\n+++ b/src/pkg/net/timeout_test.go\tFri Oct 15 14:21:53 2010 +0200\n@@ -51,8 +51,8 @@\n }\n \n func TestTimeoutTCP(t *testing.T) {\n-\t// 74.125.19.99 is www.google.com.\n+\t// 66.249.92.104 is www.google.com.\n \t// could use dns, but dns depends on\n \t// timeouts and this is the timeout test.\n-\ttestTimeout(t, \"tcp\", \"74.125.19.99:80\", false)\n+\ttestTimeout(t, \"tcp\", \"66.249.92.104:80\", false)\n }\u003c/pre\u003e",
