At the least, 'uname -a' output, also 'cat /etc/lsb-release', and if you are using a VM hosting provider, which one? Also useful might be the output of 'ls -l /dev/*random', to test Ian's hypothesis that urandom is configured as random (which I kind of doubt, but worth checking). \r\n\r\nIt really seems like this is a kernel problem, but maybe we can help find it. Thanks.",
