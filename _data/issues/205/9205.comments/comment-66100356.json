But I also don't understand\nwhy mime/multipart needs secure random strings.  As far as I can see mime/multipart\ncould reasonably use math/random instead.\n\nBrad, you switched from math/rand to crypto/rand in\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/4532089\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/4532089\u003c/a\u003e .  Any special reason?\n\nIt's also possible that this indicates a bug in crypto/rand.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **release-go1.5**._",
