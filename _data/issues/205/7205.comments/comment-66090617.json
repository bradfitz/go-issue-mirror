This shouldn't happen, but does in this situation because of...\n\nThe secondary bug is that the write to b in this situation is not considered a kill of b\nbecause an interface{} is a fat value.  The \"write\" actually occurs with two separate\ninstructions and neither is obviously a kill by itself.\n\nNot sure how to fix it just yet.  Still looking...\u003c/pre\u003e",
