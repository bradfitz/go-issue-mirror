	"body": "No, the ConnWrapper from https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/19741/1/src/crypto/tls/conn.go is an infection. I don't want more of that. It hurts composability if everybody has to worry about optional unwrapping interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe *tls.Conn is already part of APIs and is not an interface. That ship has sailed, for better or worse.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this for now, until a more compelling use case arises. I don't think performance or muxing is enough. Performance gets better each release, and muxing seems like it has workarounds which can live in the mux.",
