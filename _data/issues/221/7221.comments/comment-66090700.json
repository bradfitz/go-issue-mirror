I expect \n\ngo test foo -- -v 27\n\nto invoke:\n\n  foo.test -- -v 27\n\nThe shadowing of -v is fundamental to the design of the merged command line that 'go\ntest' accepts. Renaming the test's flag is the easiest fix. I believe the issue as\nstated (cmd/go: test hides -v from underlying binary) is working as intended.\n\nIf for some reason a test needs to use the same flag as a standard 'go test' option, a\nworkaround is to take advantage of the fact that an unrecognized flag marks the end of\nthe 'go test' flags, and put this in the test:\n\nvar myflags = flag.Bool(\"myflags\", false, \"unused\")\n\nand then invoke\n\ngo test -myflags -v\u003c/pre\u003e",
