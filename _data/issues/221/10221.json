	"body": "Solaris programs are always dynamically linked. In general, they use dlopen(3c) and dlsym(3c) to find symbols on demand. However, some tools like DTrace are not happy about it; you can't put a probe on, say, `pid$target:libsocket.so:sendfile:entry` because libsocket.so is not loaded yet when DTrace is setting up probes.\r\n",
