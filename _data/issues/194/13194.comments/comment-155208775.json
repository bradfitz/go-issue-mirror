And as far as I can tell, simply deleting testBench from the conditional means that benchmarking output will not be shown by default, which seems clearly not useful.  If we had a way for the go tool to distinguish test and bench output, perhaps we could do something; that leads us toward issues #2981 and #12826.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue in favor of those, but feel free to reopen if you think I have misunderstood.",
