	"body": "From `src/cmd/go/test.go`:\r\n```go\r\n\t// stream test output (no buffering) when no package has\r\n\t// been given on the command line (implicit current directory)\r\n\t// or when benchmarking.\r\n\t// Also stream if we're showing output anyway with a\r\n\t// single package under test or if parallelism is set to 1.\r\n\t// In these cases, streaming the output produces the same result\r\n\t// as not streaming, just more immediately.\r\n\ttestStreamOutput = len(pkgArgs) == 0 || testBench ||\r\n\t\t(testShowPass \u0026\u0026 (len(pkgs) == 1 || buildP == 1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the `testBench` exemption should be removed, but I thought I'd file an issue before submitting the change.",
