	"body": "If someone is working in a tree where they have gone to the trouble to vendor a package, as long as the vendored copy is visible (not blocked by internal) we should make sure the vendored copy is always preferred. Otherwise goimports may hurt more than it helps in these situations.\r\n\r\nOnce there is a standard config file explaining what has been vendored, goimports could just read it and when it wants to use X but there's a vendored copy visible, use the vendored copy instead.\r\n\r\nThis came up in a private discussion with an external project about vendoring.",
