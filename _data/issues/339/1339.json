Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Use gob to save a function to a file\n2. look at the size of the file\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nA file larger than 0 bytes.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nA file with 0 bytes.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nUbuntu 10.04\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\na544d1957b0f tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n This bug was found when trying to make a server that could keep running if you want to recompile a function. It would use Inotify to look at .func files and load them when modified. But gob does not work, and I have been unable to find a workaround.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1339/0/funcCompiler.go\"\u003efuncCompiler.go\u003c/a\u003e (522 bytes)",
