In coming up to speed on Juju, it was very confusing for me to see bson.M everywhere in our storage code, using map[string]interface{} would have made that code a lot easier to understand.  To this day, it's a not insignificant source of cognitive overhead every time I look at the code.  Aliases make this kind of thing even more attractive, because the types are exactly the same, so there's basically zero penalty for doing it.",
