	"body": "@Merovius If you follow the current proposal, it doesn't work to just alias one type out of a package. The whole packages need to become synonyms. In fact, what you're proposing is package path aliasing (that would work).\r\n\r\nThat's a different mechanism altogether though. (which would not require build tags)\r\n\r\nIt's also the reason why, in the initial use case that was presented (package splitting/refactoring), the smaller packages need to reconstitute the API surface they are stemming from (ghost package) and then we can declare a package path alias.\r\n\r\nOne could mutate the initial package and not create a \"ghost\" package but it does not favor fast, concurrent builds. (you would need a lock).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
