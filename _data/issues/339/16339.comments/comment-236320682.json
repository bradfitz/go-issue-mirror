Let's just imagine we all work for google and our google boss has asked us to fix this. I ask for the core golang team to label it as Go 2.0 google edition for now so their is no fear by most of us that this is going into 1.x. Then we all can just concentrate on a type alias solution with a clear mind, not whether it is a bad idea or not. Look at it this way, you can't ask for anything better then to design a blueprint and let google test it for us on their infrastructure. If it fails we can say I told you so, if it works then maybe we can have the 1.x bad idea discussion afterwards.",
