	"body": "\u003e Finally, I think the proposal should explicitly forbid declaring a method with an alias for a receiver. It's one more way to prevent abuse. If we do the \"no two names\" or \"only qualified identifier\" rule, it happens automatically, but I think being explicit clarifies that abuse is limited.\r\n\r\nThis is something I would likely try as a new Go programmer. An alias is a\r\nstatement of \"this thing or type is defined in this other package, which\r\nmay not actually match what I'm saying it says here\". Now that I've defined\r\nsome expected behavior, why not write some methods on memory data with this\r\nbehavior? But that other package owns the memory behavior on its types and\r\nvariables (memory data), which the alias is asserting ownership over.\r\n\r\nCompile-time assertions?\r\nassert.HasBehavior(alias.the_volatile_package.ImportantType,\r\nmyVolatilePackageImportantTypeBehaviorVerifier), run these at compile, but\r\nthen remove in final code listing. That way there is a flag for unexpected\r\nchanged behavior. Effectively an independent package testing approach.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if my description matches the need, the alias described in\r\nthis mailing thread, or the proposal, which I will read before adding more,\r\nas I'm now wondering if this could be done with Go interfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sun, Jul 24, 2016 at 4:04 PM, Robin Eklind \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n\u003e PS note that if referring to this link\r\n\u003e https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/24867/ I couldn't find a link to\r\n\u003e https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/16339-alias-decls.md\r\n\u003e or maybe I am not used to the go-review interface.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e A closer look reveals that the project is proposal (i.e. the proposal\r\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/proposal\u003e sub-repo) and the path of the added\r\n\u003e file is design/16339-alias-decls.md, thus\r\n\u003e https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/16339-alias-decls.md\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e â€”\r\n\u003e You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\n\u003e Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\r\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/16339#issuecomment-234808619\u003e, or mute\r\n\u003e the thread\r\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AHlLSxCr3h9-nj6AOZ4UECFWG6i9dI-fks5qY--GgaJpZM4JK0gz\u003e\r\n\u003e .\r\n\u003e\r\n",
