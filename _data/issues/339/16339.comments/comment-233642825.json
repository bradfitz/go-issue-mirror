Google may be first to the problem, but others will encounter it as well.  That's not to say that this the best or only solution, or that there needs to be a language-level solution at all.  But I do think it's a real problem, and it's one that many other languages don't have.  Go has chosen to uniquely identify types by a combination of import package name and exported name, and Go does not provide any form of type aliasing.  Most other languages identify types by a simple name, and many provide some form of type aliasing.",
