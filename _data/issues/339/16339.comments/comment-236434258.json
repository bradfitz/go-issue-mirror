Let's leave googleness out of this, please.\r\n\r\nThe benefit is clear: you can move types (and functions, variables) to another package, without breaking compatibility. It doesn't help with adding breaking changes, yes, that's not what the proposal is about. That's a different problem.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to wait for people to migrate their code because you aren't making breaking changes. Again, you're discussing a different problem.\r\n\r\nIt adds very little complexity to the language. It's never been a disliked feature in other languages that I'm aware of.\r\n\r\nI've asked if people can provide examples of aliasing being misused in other languages, that would be more constructive than just speculating that this will happen to Go.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the context package seems like a bad example to you should point you in the right direction: this proposal helps with it, SemVer doesn't. This proposal is about solving stuff like context, not for what SemVer is useful for.\r\n\r\nPlease provide an example with a couple of types of where SemVer would help and in which this proposal would too (so that it's a sort of counter-proposal).",
