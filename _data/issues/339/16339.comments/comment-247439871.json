It states \"In Go development historically, a lack of agreement means decline.\" But this assumes that it is possible to reach agreement in an open forum at github. I have no problem with the Google team having the final call, but please be explicit about it, because otherwise people will be disappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
