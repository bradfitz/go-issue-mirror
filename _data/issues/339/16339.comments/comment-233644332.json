There are plenty of things that\npeople are asking for, things that are blocking them writing Go programs\ntoday, like your multidimensional slice proposal.\n\nI don't see how adding a feature for Google's internal needs is the most\nimportant change that could be made to the language.\n\nOn Wed, 20 Jul 2016, 00:03 Ian Lance Taylor \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e @davecheney \u003chttps://github.com/davecheney\u003e It's a fair argument, though\n\u003e I don't think Google's needs are unique here. I think what this is trying\n\u003e to address is a problem that arises in large scale refactoring. Google may\n\u003e be first to the problem, but others will encounter it as well. That's not\n\u003e to say that this the best or only solution, or that there needs to be a\n\u003e language-level solution at all. But I do think it's a real problem, and\n\u003e it's one that many other languages don't have. Go has chosen to uniquely\n\u003e identify types by a combination of import package name and exported name,\n\u003e and Go does not provide any form of type aliasing. Most other languages\n\u003e identify types by a simple name, and many provide some form of type\n\u003e aliasing.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/16339#issuecomment-233642825\u003e, or mute\n\u003e the thread\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAAcA18QFrc6CHvZLGTV8wmobT8WxrU9ks5qXNk_gaJpZM4JK0gz\u003e\n\u003e .\n\u003e\n",
