	"body": "Separately: Though I'd prefer migrations outside source, handled by a tool,  if aliases _were_ in Go, the main thing on my mind would still be encouraging library users to actually transition to the new canonical names, and making that easy for them. \r\n\r\nI think that means having a tool that will statically resolve aliases, and making `lint` encourage you to run it when it notices you referencing the old names. That still wouldn't be ideal for my \"OSS dev who wants to change an API\" scenario; no OSS library author can be confident all their users use `lint`, so some users will never find out there was a transition. Still beats not even trying to encourage users to converge on the new API.",
