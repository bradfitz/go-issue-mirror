	"body": "Personally, just off the top of my head ðŸ‘Ž , I think I'm not interested in language features specifically targeting refactoring. I vendor libraries (using submodules or subtrees) for precisely this reason. That is, all my vendors can change their implementations at will without breaking my builds and my repos can uptake more current libraries as time permits.\r\n\r\nIn fact, i'm inclined to think this is a very bad idea because you can end up with aliases to libraries that further change their interfaces and break the aliases. For example, let's just say I ended up with 50 libraries that alias types in my library. How do I know about those dependencies? And if i choose to make a drastic change and privatize or rename the type, let's say i even gave a year notice of its deprecation. Do the aliases get that notification? How? And after the deprecation deadline, all those libraries that weren't changed now break.",
