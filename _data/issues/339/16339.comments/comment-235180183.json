It has the same semantic advantages of @ianlancetaylor suggestion, but as it's a separate declaration side-steps some issues, namely the grouping with other imports, the semantic difference to other imports (package vs. file scope) and the fact that other imports use a string-literal for the import path, whereas an alias should use a package name, referring to an already imported package. By having a separate keyword, the separate semantics are clearer.",
