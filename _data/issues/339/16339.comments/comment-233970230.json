	"body": "@griesemer regarding the minimal proposal, I'm far less concerned (-0.1 instead of a -1). Some open questions: is this intended to evolve into a general mechanism or is its intent fully limited to refactoring?\r\n\r\n### If limited to refactoring:\r\n\r\n1. Is there any currently known benefit to \"unexported aliases\"? If not, I feel we should restrict aliasing to be from qualified imported types to exported local names (we can always expand that later if we find a use-case for unexported aliases).\r\n2. I do feel it would be proper to add some strategic inconveniences (restricting to *_alias.go or an equivalent measure).\r\n3. Will there be any tooling support to help uses of aliasing stay short-lived? E.g. some tool that complains when using type that is the \"source\" of an alias?\r\n\r\n### If intended as a general mechanism:\r\n\r\n1. What are the use cases beyond refactoring?\r\n2. Will it be confused with some notion of sub-typing?",
