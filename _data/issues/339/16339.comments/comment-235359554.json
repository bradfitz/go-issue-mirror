	"body": "In case it wasn't clear: I don't love the thing I proposed above. I only proposed it because people have been claiming that this is a build system problem, not a language problem, and I think that claim deserves a deeper investigation before it's rejected. (The above proposal was my attempt to investigate it.) In the spirit of continuing to argue for my proposal (which again, I don't really love):\r\n\r\n@bcmills \r\n\u003e It still produces multiple names for the same type / function / variable.\r\n\r\nNot any more than Ian's proposal. My intent was to implement Ian's proposal at the build-system level, rather than the language level, since some people seem to consider build system hacks less objectionable than new language features.\r\n\r\n\u003e It still adds indirection for users to understand the implementation of the refactored package.\r\n\u003e It still requires deep integration with godoc in order to display useful documentation for the refactored package.\r\n\r\nThese are true. But, if you view the feature as something only useful for refactorings that will be temporary, you might (reasonably) argue that, for this use case, it would suffice to add a README file that says \"package is being refactored, see doc \u003chere\u003e\". Once you have full integration with godoc, you have an implicit blessing to continue using those aliases indefinitely. Without godoc integration, there is social pressure to finish the refactoring.",
