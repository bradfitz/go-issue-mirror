I know because I wanted such a feature at the time I tried to use the functional options idiom.\r\n\r\nYou quickly realise that you wish for aliases, if you use the idiom in a package that is being imported. (since you wish to use  the option type at the top level)\r\n\r\nApplying this multiple times transitively, you really, really do wish for aliases.\r\n\r\nBut in fact, you are just making things probably more complex than they ought to be in the end. Changing the importing logic solved many things.\r\n\r\nI would still be cautious to not encourage bad designs.",
