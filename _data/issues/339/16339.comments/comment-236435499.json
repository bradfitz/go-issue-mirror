And I don't want some library I depend on, breaking its API contract under my feet without me knowing it. You want to change your API ? Fine. Make another package and let me decide whether I want to migrate or not.\r\n\r\n\u003e Assumption is the mother of all issues\r\n\r\nI meant assumption as in \"mathematical\" assumption\r\n",
