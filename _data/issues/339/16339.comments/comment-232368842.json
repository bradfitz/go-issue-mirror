It means the proposed mechanism is general and powerful.\r\n\r\nI find this second application appealing. Note that we already have a similar mechanism for 'go test' that provides a similar feature, namely exporting a variable/function only when testing. (See any of the files named \"export_test.go\" in the standard library.) It is very useful.",
