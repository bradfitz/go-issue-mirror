For example, despite the language allowing programs like https://play.golang.org/p/yjkxqVY4eo, you never see code like that. On the other hand, the ability to write code like that is also the reason you can have methods (for example on marshalling implementations) named int and string, which I do frequently. In this case as in many others, we do trust that programmers mostly will not abuse important, useful features.",
