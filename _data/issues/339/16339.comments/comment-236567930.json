But I think it should be generalized, i.e. done at the package level instead of the package object level.\r\n\r\nIt's in the same spirit that I formulated my counter-proposal: it doesn't aliases objects but copy them.\r\nSee here: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16339#issuecomment-235740256\r\n\r\nIt may indeed require some kind of compiler directive but I'd rather it wasn't a build tag lookalike.\r\nI've also tried to describe the refactoring workflow required.\r\n",
