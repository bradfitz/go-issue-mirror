	"body": "What about implementing a separate go version build that only google uses, they did that already for appengine? Just make a source patch for google that they can use for there own go version build and everybody is happy? Who am I to argue with core golang developers, just go ahead and implement it but make sure its on a experimental google alias branch. I think it is now safely to say that everybody can agree that type alias is not ment for 98% of all golang projects right? O and one more thing I like this syntax more `type T \u003c\u003e pkg.T1`",
