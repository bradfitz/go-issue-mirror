An alias.\r\n\r\nI suspect a lot of people organizing large code bases would do the same:\r\nsilently live within the existing constraints for having little hope of\r\nseeing the situation improved.\r\n\r\nThen, this is actually a mechanism of very simple semantics that aids in\r\npreserving working code bases while improving them. In its absence people\r\nare currently just moving, or creating a concrete type such as bson.M,\r\nwhich makes the situation worse.\r\n\r\n+1 on the proposal, assuming some nicer syntax (=\u003e ?).",
