Though obviously one should not do such a thing. Vet check?\r\n\r\nWhat would the effect of\r\n```\r\ntype unexported struct {}\r\ntype Exported -\u003e unexported\r\n```\r\nbe? That seems like it would have to be explicitly illegal.\r\n\r\nAs far as the syntax, I do like @ better than -\u003e, very mnemonic. Totally fine with -\u003e thoughâ€”it'd stop feeling weird after a couple uses.",
