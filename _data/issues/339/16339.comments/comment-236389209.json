And this is a good thing - ask Swift developers about it. \r\nContext is the one and only exception - and i hope it will be. And because it's the standard library vendoring for example there is not a real option: I get that. But i doubt that one change to the standard library is justification enough for the alias declarations - they will be around forever with all it's implications.",
