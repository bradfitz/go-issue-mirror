	"body": "As far as I can see the limited types-only form of this proposal won't help with moving context package. Aliases for both variables (https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/context#pkg-variables) and types are required.\r\n\r\nAnother observation is that alias use cases for refactoring are somewhat limited by possible circular dependecies. E.g. if I have `math/big.Float` and `math/big.Sqrt(Float)` and want to move `Sqrt` function into a new package `bigmath` and preserve `math/big.Sqrt` for backward compatibility I cannot use aliases for that.\r\n\r\nI would like to see more real-life use cases when the proposed feature would be useful (like `net/context` example above).\r\n",
