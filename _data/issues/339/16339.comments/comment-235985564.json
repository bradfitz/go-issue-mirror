It constrains the aliased names to be identical, which satisfies the main use cases of refactoring and building multi-package components while limiting the chance for confusion. (It would prevent giving short names to long type expressions, but that was never more than a nice side-effect.) I'd also add Rob's one-name-per-package rule. \r\n\r\nI don't understand why \"export\" (or whatever word we choose) needs to be a keyword. Couldn't it only have this special meaning at top level? ",
