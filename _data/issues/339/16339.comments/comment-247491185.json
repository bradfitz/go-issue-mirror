	"body": "I apologize to the many people who have voiced disagreement with this proposal and feel that they were not heard. You were heard. We considered what you said carefully, we engaged and responded (especially @griesemer and @ianlancetaylor), and we limited the proposal in response, restricting both the location and the target of the alias declaration.\r\n\r\nI wish there could be widespread agreement on this issue about the merits and tradeoff here. That is our ideal for any proposal. But there is not, and after two months of discussion it seems clear that further discussion is not going to change the situation. At this point the best way to learn more is to implement this proposal and try it. We still have until the Go 1.8 release to disable it if a strong reason turns up.\r\n\r\nAlthough the many important voices here are split, Rob, Robert, Ian, and I are not. Along with Ken, who is no longer working on Go on a daily basis, we were responsible for nearly all of the original design of Go, and we all agree, based on our extensive experience with Go and with very large Go code bases, that something along the lines of this proposal is needed. I ask only that you give us the benefit of the doubt on this decision and come along with us to see how it turns out.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
