Keep in mind that already now, a programmer can create aliases to things: For instance, two pointers may point to the same object.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to keep in mind: While alias declarations introduce more names for an object, the property that one can trace back the declaration of anything by following the declarations backward is still true: For any alias name in use, there is an explicit declaration, and that declaration leads back to the origin.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the only place where this is currently not the case is with dot-imports: A dot-import populates the file block with names but one never sees an explicit declaration in the code. Aliases could be used instead of dot-imports and actually make this much clearer.",
