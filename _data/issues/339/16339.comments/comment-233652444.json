I'm not sure what point you are making by comparing them.  I agree: there is no competition to make a change to the language.  We can make both, one, or neither.  They are separate.\r\n\r\nOf course if this change is a net negative then we should not make it.  But we do need some kind of support for large scale refactoring.  I do not accept the contention that large scale refactoring is Google-specific.",
