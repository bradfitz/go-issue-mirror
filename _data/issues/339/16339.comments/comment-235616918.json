It seems pretty obvious to me how it *would* help with Context; namely, it would allow `golang.org/x/net/context.Context` to be an alias for `context.Context`.\r\n\r\nIt's true that aliasing entire packages (e.g. in the build system) would suffice for the particular case of `context`, but it would not help with a number of other refactoring problems (e.g. moving a subset of types out of the `proto` package).",
