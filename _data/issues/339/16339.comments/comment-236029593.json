	"body": "I do believe it needs a new keyword, because it is a grammar-change. `nil` can get away with being a predeclared identifier because every place you use it also accepts an identifier. The same can't really be true for `alias`: If that would become a predeclared identifier, you suddenly accept identifiers to start a top-level declaration. `alias` would need to become a \"keyword-light\", it needs a dedicated term in the spec that is neither keyword (because that would potentially break programs that use it as an identifier) nor identifier (because that would make the definition of the grammar very awkward. `AliasDecl := \u003cidentifier but only alias\u003e \u003cqualified identifier\u003e`). It's possible to make it a \"keyword-light\", but it *is* a bit awkward.",
