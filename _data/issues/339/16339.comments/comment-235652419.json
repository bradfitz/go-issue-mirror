Since, by way of aliasing, it becomes now std/context.Context if I understand what you are proposing.\r\n\r\nYes.  The definition of `golang.org/x/net/context.Context` would change to alias, you'd recompile everything that depends on it once (just like if that definition changed in any other way), and now you're back to incremental builds as usual.",
