I don't think we should prevent aliases to aliases... because then if someone has already aliased your type, you could inadvertently break them by aliasing it yourself... when the whole point of your alias is *not* to break your consumers.  I'm not sure it's worth the headache just to avoid an alias to an alias, which is perfectly understandable (if annoying when navigating sourcecode).\r\n",
