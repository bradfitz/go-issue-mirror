	"body": "@dwlnetnl @davecheney This proposal is not the multi-dimensional slice proposal.  From my perspective, which may of course be incorrect, the multi-dimensional slice proposal is at a local minimum.  I'm not happy with it, because it doesn't support different stride lengths through an existing array, something that I believe is useful for image processing.  The author does not think that different stride lengths are important, and may of course be correct about that.  I tried a counter-proposal to address that (#13253) but it was badly flawed.  To move forward, I feel that we have to either decide that strides don't matter (but I don't know how to make that decision) or we need to write a proposal that supports strides (but that hasn't happened) or we need to have a clear understanding of how the current proposal could evolve to support strides (but as far as I can tell we don't have that).  I am speaking only for myself here.",
