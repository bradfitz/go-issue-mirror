IMO this is the culmination of several\r\nwell meaning and well reasoned changes to the language and its tools that\r\nhave resulted in a less cohesive and more complex whole. Specifically:\r\n\r\n1. internal/ packages encourage a proliferation of a taxonomy of tiny\r\nlittle packages with poor names and divided responsibilities.\r\n2. this alias proposal permits the package author to continue in this\r\nfashion, then smoosh them all back together into an idiomatic _looking_ top\r\nlevel package.\r\n\r\nPeople will go hog wild with this feature creating byzantine levels of\r\ncomplex intertwined packages then cover that all up with a thick layer of\r\naliiasing (cpp's #define comes sharply to mind, Fortran's EQUIVALENCE is\r\nanother)\r\n\r\nI cannot express how strongly I do not wish to see this alias feature\r\nimplemented in the language.\r\n\r\nOn Fri, Jul 22, 2016 at 10:09 AM, Minux Ma \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\r\n\r\n\u003e On Thu, Jul 21, 2016 at 8:03 PM, Dave Cheney \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\r\n\u003e wrote:\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e \u003e server is a bad name for a package, client is also a bad name for a\r\n\u003e \u003e package.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e I have explicitly said \"multiple internal packages\".
