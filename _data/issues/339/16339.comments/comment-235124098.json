	"body": "I can't see why it's a bad thing for this proposal that an attempted misuse generates a compile-time error (adding a method to an name aliased from another package). The program won't compile, so by definition it can't cause problems.\r\n\r\nAs to the other concern, things like aliasing fmt.Sprintf: you can already do that!\r\n\r\n   var Sprintf = fmt.Sprintf\r\n\r\nSame basic result. Yet we don't see it. Why does this proposal make it more likely?\r\n\r\nIt's important to understand that the idea of conventions has been a huge part of the Go community, and I believe that it will be sufficient to keep abuse of any feature under control. It has so far.\r\n\r\n",
