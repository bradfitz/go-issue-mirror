Variable aliases are not required for read-only pointer type variables.\r\n\r\n\u003e You can, actually. It would require moving the Float type into either bigmath or a (possibly-internal) third package that both big and bigmath can alias into ...\r\n\r\nThis assumes that I want to introduce a third package. And it can be made internal only if `big` and `bigmath` import paths share a common prefix. All I wanted to highlight is that using aliases for refactoring is not possible in some cases.",
