In addition I don't think adding features with ugly syntax or providing go vet warnings is a good pattern going forward for new golang features. I also generally am not a fan of indirection patterns using aliases to clean up packages as given in the protobuff/proto example above. This just forces me to jump through even more files to see the internal implementation.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Based on @egonelbre's comment, wanted to qualify what i consider abuse.\r\n\r\n1) Cleaning up the interface to a messy package by including a bunch of aliases to provide a cleaner interface.\r\n2) Using tons of aliases in code makes the code less readable and causes the developer to jump through multiple layers of indirection.\r\n3) Aliasing of imported external packages makes the code less clear about which packages are actually getting used.",
