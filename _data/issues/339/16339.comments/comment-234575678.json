	"body": "One thing I haven't seen mentioned  yet is cgo. \r\n\r\nIf you include the same header file in different Go packages cgo generates the Go-version of the C types in that package so the same C type ends up as different Go types. \r\n\r\nSome useful C libraries are quite large and should be broken up into multiple Go packages as they effectively are in C by being spread across optional header files that extend and enhance a main header.\r\n\r\nWith this and internal/ you could have a large ugly internal/ package with all the necessary C definitions and expose the Go wrappers to them naturally as multiple packages, either directly with an exported alias or indirectly with a safer/more idiomatic wrapper around an unexported alias. \r\n\r\nI have done this without internal/ and alias. I would not attempt it again without both.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is definitely not something everybody should use everyday in every code base. It's the kind of thing, like goto, that, when you see it in code, your first instinct should be \"that's wrong, why's that there?\" until you've understood the code well enough to conclude \"well, fine—but I got my eye on you, buddy\". That doesn't make it bad or wrong or without merit. You should be distrustful of this proposal, but it does serve a very real use so it is worth considering despite that uneasy feeling in your stomach.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I love internal packages and think they are vastly underused and that everyone should use them by default until they realize they have no choice but to expose the package. I have one that just has a single constant in it. \r\n\r\nSo maybe I'm just wrong inherently.\r\n\r\n(You should always write your internal packages exactly as you would non-internal packages—with documents, proper naming, purpose, etc.—as if you were under constant threat of some madman running by and pulling a lever that exposes it to the world at any point.)",
