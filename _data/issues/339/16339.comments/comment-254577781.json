For instance, I can easily import a package under different names and then access it's exported entities in various forms:\r\n```\r\nimport \"math\"\r\nimport foo \"math\"\r\nimport . \"math\"\r\n\r\n// Here, math.Sin, foo.Sin, and Sin all denote the very same function.\r\n```\r\nAgain, I believe the fears of having multiple aliases for the same entity are overblown. Furthermore, it's not too hard to write a vet check that could detect them, if it becomes a real issue.\r\n\r\nRe: contingency plans: I'm open to enable aliases only when ALIAS_EXPERIMENT=1, but this is TBD.",
