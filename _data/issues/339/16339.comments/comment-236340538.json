IMO, somehow a team inside Google have made such a mess that they need to change the language to be able to refactor their way out of this problem.\r\n\r\nI believe firmly that nobody outside Google would have been successful in raising such a proposal. They would have been told, \"sorry, we understand the problem you've gotten yourself into, but we're not going to change the language to fix the mess you've made\".\r\n\r\nAnd, because of the access this team within Google have, all Go users will have to live with the unexpected consequences of adding aliases to the language forever.",
