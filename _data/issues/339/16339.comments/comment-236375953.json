It's unfortunate that proposal is technically not backwards-compatible, otherwise I might strongly prefer that proposal over this one.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've seen in other threads, the current implementation is currently broken as the specs doesn't mandate using package name and name of interface for it to work. And while yes, it would break a lot of things, that's why we can wait until Go 2.0 which can be released if only to fix that and you'd immediately understand that Go 2.0 has a breaking change when coming from 1.x.\r\n\r\n\u003e Here's a simple idea. Add a new environment variable GOPKGALIASES. \r\n\r\nI've sadly stopped reading (and won't further read) when I've seen adding yet another environment variable. New people are struggling wrapping their heads around GOPATH and how it works yet the solution to a search and replace problem is to change the language and introduce an environment variable which controls something related to the compiler? Oh and the current implementation is not under the language specifications nor the same assurance in terms of breaking as the language specifications. As someone who toys with Go tools in my spare time I'd oppose to that even more than I'm opposing to the the current alias proposal.",
