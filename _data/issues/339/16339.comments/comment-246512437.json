Please don't conflate the two, or it'll be the ruin of\nthem both.\n\nOn Tue, 13 Sep 2016, 02:58 Felix Lange \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\n\u003e A positive aspect that might be obvious to some, but wasn't to me\n\u003e initially: this proposal partially solves the 'vendoring edge case'. To\n\u003e recap with a concrete example\n\u003e\n\u003e package fooclient\n\u003e import \"github.com/x/net/websocket\" // vendored alongside package fooclient\n\u003e func DialWebsocket(b websocket.Config) *Connection { ... }\n\u003e\n\u003e The caller of DialWebsocket cannot construct websocket.Config because it\n\u003e cannot refer to it (vendored packages cannot be imported). There are a few\n\u003e ways around this problem right now, without type aliases:\n\u003e\n\u003e    - don't use imported types in API surface (not always possible)\n\u003e    - provide wrapper definitions (inconvenient, limiting)\n\u003e    - limit use of vendoring\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases provide a workaround: package fooclient would declare aliases for\n\u003e websocket.Config which the caller can refer to. In this particular case, a\n\u003e suitable alias definition might be:\n\u003e\n\u003e package fooclient\n\u003e import \"github.com/x/net/websocket\" // vendored alongside package fooclient\n\u003e type WebsocketConfig =\u003e websocket.Configfunc NewWebsocketConfig =\u003e websocket.NewConfig\n\u003e func DialWebsocket(b *WebsocketConfig) *Conn { ... }\n\u003e\n\u003e I'm not even sure myself whether this is a good or bad use of aliases. One\n\u003e nice aspect is that package fooclient stays in control of the exported API.\n\u003e On the flip side, readability is hindered because it is not clear what a\n\u003e WebsocketConfig actually consists of.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/16339#issuecomment-246414540\u003e, or mute\n\u003e the thread\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAAcA9zcjQpXNJhcq2jMjOCkGly7Y65Yks5qpYS-gaJpZM4JK0gz\u003e\n\u003e .\n\u003e\n",
