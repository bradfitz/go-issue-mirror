	"body": "@mewmew I agree that #8082 would address the specific case of the `context` move and I am not saying it's not a good idea (I've felt the same way about interfaces for a while). However, as I pointed out earlier, this specific move isn't going to profit a lot of any currently discussed proposal (as it's not going to make 1.7), so you should rather view it as a topical, recent and widely visible example that these kinds of moves are happening and are going to continue to happen. And they won't be limited to just interface types. Also, obviously, #8082 is breaking compatibility, while this is not :)",
