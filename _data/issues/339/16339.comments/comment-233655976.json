	"body": "@ianlancetaylor then the problem should be expressed as such: people which have _large_ scale refactoring needs should step forward and speak. If they are enough (say more than a handful) then it can be seen as useful outside of Google.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, looking at the potential abuse that will add:\r\n- until now we considered dot imports to be a bad thing now it's a good one if it's using aliases?!, maybe I've misunderstood that point?\r\n- exporting types that are in the `internal/` package (bad API design imho)\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nI think this is rather a harmful proposal for the language as it goes against the Go being made to be easily readable. Someone argued that if we make this ugly enough people will feel compelled not to use it / quickly finish the said big refactoring / temporary workaround. However all the evidence points to the contrary, if it's there, people will use it, and it will have to be supported down the line.\r\n\r\nAgain, please accept this might be a Google specific problem if it doesn't appear to be a concern for the others due to the way vendoring / versioning are used (or should be used). To this end I'd propose asking the community for feedback on how they structure the packages / code bases / deal with large numbers of \"own\" dependencies and how is refactoring being done.",
