There are sufficient ways to address this, including and not limited to vendoring. Currently vendoring doesn't work nicely with libraries but a package manager would flatten the said dependencies and then the problem would disappear.\r\n\r\n\u003e For better or worse, Go's current package management system is (partially) controlled by environment variables (GOROOT and GOPATH). Adding a third variable (GOPKGALIASES) is a quick and simple solution that doesn't seem too offensive to me in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nNot needed, see above.",
