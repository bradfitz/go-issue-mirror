You now have to recompile every client of net/context.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e You can see it like this... it would be the same thing as rewriting every import of net/context and replacing them by the std lib context import. You still need to recompile if you do that.\r\n\r\nYou have to recompile every user of a type when the definition of that type changes.  Aliases do not change that fact.  Aliases provide source compatibility, not ABI compatibility.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that some build systems would need to be updated to take that into account, although I would be surprised if many do in practice: I would expect the Go export data for aliased types to be forwarded in the package object files in the same manner as any other use of a type from another package in an exported API.",
