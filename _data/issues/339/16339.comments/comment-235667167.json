	"body": "@ianlancetaylor With regards to https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16339#issuecomment-235142690, a syntax that implies the restrictions @robpike https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16339#issuecomment-234742924 mentioned is +1 from me.\r\n\r\nIn terms of readability, I would really like to see a new keyword for package-level aliases such as `alias` as @Merovius and @minux suggested https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16339#issuecomment-235183786. To me that is far more clear than just an operator that looks like assignment or overloading the file-level `import` keyword.\r\n\r\nI imagine we could [use BigQuery](https://medium.com/google-cloud/analyzing-go-code-with-bigquery-485c70c3b451#.q9njwfmu4) to see how often `alias` occurs in the wild.\r\n\r\nDoes introducing a new keyword make this a Go 2.0 feature? I think it should. But if this important enough, who's to say we can't shift other Go 2.0 proposals/changes to Go 3.0 and have Go 2.0 sooner rather than later?",
