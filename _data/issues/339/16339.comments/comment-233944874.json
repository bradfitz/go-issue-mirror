	"body": "\u003e I'm concerned however about the syntax. It is important to have the same syntax for all kinds of aliases. Constants use at this moment `=`, expanding this to `type T = pkg.AnotherT` and `func sin = math.Sin` makes it consistent and predictable.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation behind using `=\u003e` was that `=` already has another meaning for variable. As exporting global variables is generally discouraged, one option may be to simply remove the option to allow aliases for variables. Then, as you've already pointed out, using `=` for type, function and constant aliases would be a clean and consistent syntax.",
