I'd like to punt that to another issue if you don't mind.\r\n\r\nAs for Resize, having a way to do it is reasonable. But there are several other related options and I'd like to think through how those work in an API. For example:\r\n\r\n- move\r\n- minimize / maximize\r\n- fullscreen\r\n\r\nDo all of these have to have their own methods? Can (or should?) they be combined into an Options struct? Additionally, there's going to be a lot of overlap between these features and NewWindowOptions. Is there any overlap that can be reused?",
