	"body": "@bradfitz I would actually prefer to remove the sql/driver uses of it, and request drivers use it to validate their own types. At least, I think that would be one of the required types to support custom database types. I just don't see the value of this call. If the driver doesn't support the parameter input type, let the driver throw the error.\r\n\r\nThe second option would be to add a new interface for the driver.Stmt, interface would be in charge of calling IsValid after checking custom driver types. So we could retain the current behavior until the driver adds the checks themselves.\r\n\r\nNo POC yet. Thoughts?\r\n",
