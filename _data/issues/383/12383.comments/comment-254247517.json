	"body": "Well, the idea was we wanted to make it easier to write drivers and not require drivers to deal with every one of Go's integer type sizes and signedness. That's why there's only `int64` not `uint16`, `int32`, etc.\r\n\r\nSo we still want to convert the common things (like `uint16` to `int64) for drivers. But if a driver wants to opt-in to other types (like `uint64` or slices of things or arbitrary things like GPS coordinates), that's fine.\r\n\r\n",
