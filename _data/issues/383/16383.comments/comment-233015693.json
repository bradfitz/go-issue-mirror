	"body": "This is a nice idea to help people familiarize with the project, but it goes so far out of what the `go` program should be doing that I don't see a reasonable way to make it a subcommand.\r\n\r\nAlso, this might sound like nitpicking, but I mention it to illustrate the issues with the approach: in your example you show the current working directory changing from `$HOME` to some other location. A program (`go`) cannot do that. You'd need to make this a shell alias to work it like that, and this strongly points in the direction of an external tool, not something baked into the `go` program. In the original issue I provided an example of such an external program, that by way of some nasty tricks disguises itself a the `go` program. And even _that_ implementation is not capable of doing what you show here.",
