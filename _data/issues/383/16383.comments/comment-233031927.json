If we wanted to sniff git username, that may be difficult for those of us who do not use github because while `git config --list --show-origin` shows my username, it does not show the host I use most. \r\n\r\n@mem On windows we could use a wrapper batch script and call the command `gonew` and the user wouldn't see the difference in 99% of cases if we do it right. In *nix we would have a sh script that would have to be ran `. gonew` which is unfortunate, but the standard way. I think we would also need this to set the env vars anyway, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I do agree it is somewhat out of scope for the `go` command but I would always prefer not cluttering PATHs with 28 different executable for every tool, however we may have to add there if we want `cd` functionality.",
