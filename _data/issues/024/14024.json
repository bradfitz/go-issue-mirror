Not really sure\r\n5. go tool dist: unknown $GOOS linux\r\n\r\nI'm trying to set my target GOOS and GOARCH to `linux/arm` whilst developing using atom go that I can build on save and see appropriate error messages given to me through the atom package: go-plus. However, When I do this on Windows, I get error messages saying go tools cannot be found. \r\n\r\nI was told running make.bat would solve this issue, however when it gets to running `.\\cmd\\dist\\` I get this error `go tool dist: unknown $GOOS linux`.\r\n\r\nObviously \"linux\" is included in `okgoos` so I'm not sure why https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/dist/build.go#L115 is failing.\r\n",
