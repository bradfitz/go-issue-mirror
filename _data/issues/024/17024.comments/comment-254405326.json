	"body": "The fact that []byte is treated like string for the purposes of %s %q %x %X is documented and emphasized multiple times in the existing doc comment. I don't believe adding any new emphasis is going to help here.\n\nAs @martisch already mentioned:\n\n\tFor compound operands such as slices and structs, the format\n\tapplies to the elements of each operand, recursively, not to the\n\toperand as a whole. Thus %q will quote each element of a slice\n\tof strings, and %6.2f will control formatting for each element\n\tof a floating-point array.\n\n\tHowever, when printing a byte slice with a string-like verb\n\t(%s %q %x %X), it is treated identically to a string, as a single item.",
