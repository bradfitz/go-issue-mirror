It also wouldn't integrate into automatic rebuilding scenarios such as the\nappengine local server for example (which is where I'm using it).\n\nThe path is a good point. I think the best thing is if it is just a relative path to the\nlocation of the .go file that the statement appears in. E.g.\n\nconst shader string = import(\"../shaders/myshader.txt\")\u003c/pre\u003e",
