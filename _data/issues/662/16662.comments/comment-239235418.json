	"body": "I think there might be a problem with doing that, because the code in zsyscall_linux_ppc64le.go needs the LR to be correct, and if I change the BRs to BLs in asm_linux_ppc64x.s then the link register would have to be saved and restored in the asm, which would be unnecessary and bad for performance.\r\nIn looking further, I don't understand why zsyscall_linux_ppc64le.go has to call the syscall functions in asm_linux_ppc64x.s which then does a BR to the syscall.Syscall (or syscall.Syscall6, or syscall.RawSyscall, etc.).  Couldn't the asm file be avoid altogether and just call syscall.Syscall directly from zsyscall_linux_ppc64le.go?",
