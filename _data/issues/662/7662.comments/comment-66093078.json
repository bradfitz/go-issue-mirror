Go runtime is free to create as many OS threads as it wants,\nGOMAXPROCS only controls how many of them could run Go code at the same time.\n\nYou can use runtime/debug.SetMaxThreads to limit the number threads runtime\ncan create.\n\nPS: I don't think Linux will account all fds to each individual thread because\nthose threads share the same fd table. What's your real problem?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
