What are the other threads being used for exactly?\n\nAlso, the runtime.SetMaxThreads function seems very useful but I can't find it in Go\n1.2.1. Is this only available in the latest source?\n\nLinux seems to be having an issue with the amount of fds our application is using. At\nall times the application seems to be using a normal amount of fds for the concurrent\nconnection count we are seeing, but sooner or later we will run into a \"too many files\"\nerror, indicating that we are leaking fds.\n\nOur file limit is at the maximum 1M, so for this to happen we'd have to receive above\nthe normal limit for TCP connections. Upon investigating this we saw that \"lsof\" was\nover reporting the amount of fds, while \"/proc/\u0026lt;pid\u0026gt;/fd/\" was showing a correct\nnumber.\n\nThe over reporting in \"lsof\" was caused by the large amount of threads (142) that were\nbeing created. We assumed this also was related to our root issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
