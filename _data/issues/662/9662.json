I would expect the Close() call to be a NO-OP at worst.\r\n\r\nThe fix for the server is simply to NOT close the request body. However there isn't any \"calling Body.Close() is a bad idea\", in fact people in the community have been encouraging it.\r\n\r\n[Github search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026q=%2B%22http.ResponseWriter%22+%2B%22*http.Request%22+%2B%22.Body.Close%28%29%22++language%3AGo\u0026type=Code\u0026ref=searchresults)\r\n\r\nGo version: ```go version go1.4 windows/amd64```",
