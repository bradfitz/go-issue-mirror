I could try getting one of the person to test it, but I am not sure if he\nwill agree to help. Though for him to help, I think there should be a go 1.0.3 or so\nthat incorporate all these fixes because I don't want him to get annoyed at having to\ncompile the go source on windows. Thanks.\n\nHopefully ma.adam can help you more with the problem since he seems to have a computer\nthat can reproduce it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
