	"body": "Thanks for looking into this.  It shouldn't matter that r3 is not stored, because the value was copied into r27.  Presumably the fmt.Printf, where the problem appears, is using r27 to retrieve the values.\r\n\r\nWhat puzzles me, looking at the partial disassembly, is the `addi    r27,r27,-8`.  Why is that there?  That means that r27 is not pointing into the buffer allocated by __go_new_nopointers.  It appears that nothing is pointing into that buffer, which is presumably why the buffer is being freed.  What does the instruction sequence look like for the fmt.Printf?  Where does 8 get added back to r27?",
