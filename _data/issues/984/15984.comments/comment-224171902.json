You lead by saying there is \"no way to access the runtime network poller with custom socket types,\" but then don't provide any explanation as to why this is desirable. The rationale might be obvious to some, but it's not to me. Can you provide some background as to why and how you want to use the proposed package?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
