This issue is for hooks of a tuple facility of connection endpoint, and #15021 is for hooks of I/O event multiplexing on connection endpoints.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I made a rough cut of x/net/socket package that looks a drop-in replacement of socket-related stuff in the existing syscall package this summer. It worked well on Unix variants by vendoring/replumbing. I'll send it to review once the traffic of golang-codereviews calms down.",
