In this case, it's storing to directly to the receiving G's stack, so the typedmemmove *does not* generate write barriers. If that send happens between the scan and mark termination phases, and the receiver G doesn't get scheduled between these phases, mark termination won't rescan the receiver G's stack and won't discover the sent pointer. If that's the only remaining reference to the object, it will be incorrectly collected.",
