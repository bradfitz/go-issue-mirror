Using a different random number generator for every go-routine as\nsuggested improved runtime on linux and solved the problem on the mac mini. I can't test\nthings properly using the cluster since it's under heavy load atm, but the first tests\nlook very promising.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nPS.: I had the same problems some days ago on a 4-Core linux box using an old kernel\n(2.6.24). I will have a look at the new numbers on that one too and report back soon.\u003c/pre\u003e",
