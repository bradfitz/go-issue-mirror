The\nimplements() function already has a way to find out if a pointer to the checked type\nwould implement an interface.\n\nSomewhat unrelated, the implements() error reporting is unwieldy. It takes a couple of\npointer arguments that are filled with the various properties of the error. The function\nis only used in a couple of spots and the callers either ignore the error reporting, or\nformat the properties into strings in pretty much the same way.\n\nDoes a CL that changes the error reporting to just be a formatted string make sense? It\nwould make it easier to make sure that the error reporting doesn't go out of sync, like\nit did in this case.\u003c/pre\u003e",
