For me this has shifted the line where I decided what I can code in C and what I\ncan code in Go farther to Go's favor. If I revert from pool I see massive degradation\nincluding an order of magnitude greater heap usage and what I think are GC pauses. Of\ncourse I would never actually do that and if this went away I could still use some of\nthe custom pool's I used to use (or write in C), but their performance doesn't compare\nfavorably due to lack of thread-local pooling.\u003c/pre\u003e",
