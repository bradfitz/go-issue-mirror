Per the spec http://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Constants:\r\n\r\n\"Implementation restriction: Although numeric constants have arbitrary precision in the language, a compiler may implement them using an internal representation with limited precision. ...\"\r\n\r\nThat said, right shifts should never be a problem: for x \u003e\u003e s where x is not constant, any value s \u003e= 64 can be replaced with 64 (trivial fix); and (optimization) the result of x \u003e\u003e s can be replaced with 0 if we know that x is untyped and s \u003e= 64. For x \u003e\u003e s where both x and s are constant, we can do the analogous once the shift count is over x's bit length.",
