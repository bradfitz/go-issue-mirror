But the users can always depend on\nthe NDK toolchain and System.loadLibrary if they have additional external\ndependencies and they are only targeting Android -- it should be case if\nyou're loading a dynamic lib.\n\nSo, fine. We should move on, I'll dlsym. If we don't like it, we can\nrethink and reimplement.\n\nOn Thu, Feb 26, 2015 at 7:19 AM, David Crawshaw \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e My current reasoning on dynamic libraries:\n\u003e\n\u003e    1. Every API we build in the mobile repository is for both Android and\n\u003e    iOS.\n\u003e    2. We cannot load dynamic libraries on iOS.\n\u003e    3. We can statically link on Android, except where licenses prohibit\n\u003e    it. License prohibitions on Android apply to iOS too.\n\u003e    4. We strongly prefer working in Go and minimizing C. (If everything\n\u003e    we needed from Android and iOS was available as a syscall, I would make\n\u003e    this work with CGO_ENABLED=0.)\n\u003e\n\u003e So for us to need a dynamic library: it must be necessary for implementing\n\u003e an API on Android that is available on iOS some other way, and licensing\n\u003e must prohibit static linking. I'm amazed we found even one example.\n\u003e\n\u003e It may be expedient to implement your audio package directly on OpenSL and\n\u003e you can if you like, but I think it would be of great value to game\n\u003e developers to have the full OpenAL available. So it would be nice to solve\n\u003e this, even if it means writing a script to generate a bunch of dlsym-based\n\u003e function bindings.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/9328#issuecomment-76195694\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
