If we use cgo to build OpenAL and statically link it to the bindings package, the package has to be licensed with GPL.\r\n\r\nSo, we will require libopensl to be linked dynamically and will not be building it from the source.\r\n\r\nWe should add libopenal as a part of the new toolchain, distribute the so or make the user to build it on their own. It is not going to be as easy as go-getting, but we don't seem to have any other options.\r\n\r\nMailed https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/3115/.",
