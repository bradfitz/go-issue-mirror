	"body": "OpenAL is a common subset of both the audio systems on Android and iOS, so it serves as a good place to get audio support for all-Go mobile apps.\r\n\r\nWe should start with a very thin cgo wrapper, in the style of the gl package. Probably called golang.org/x/mobile/audio.\r\n\r\nAs the API is significantly smaller than OpenGL, it may be possible to build one canonical, pleasant Go library on top of it. In which case we may want to have the cgo library in x/mobile/audio/al and keep x/mobile/audio for the user-friendly library. But it is still an open question if one nice Go library is possible.",
