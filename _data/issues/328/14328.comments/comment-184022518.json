This program installs the compiler from TDM-GCC. I later installed the latest TDM-GCC version (5.1) instead of 4.9. So, it's not like I went all wild west here. :-) \r\n\r\nI also tried the manual MingW/Msys route but it never worked for me. So. That may give you context into my build environment.",
