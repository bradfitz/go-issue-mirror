To demonstrate the problem, compile Go on a 32-bit Windows system using the compiler at http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/\r\n\r\n@minux: Two observations:\r\n\r\n1. You include windows.h. Which logically presupposes that you want the Windows API call, and not whatever mingw may provide.\r\n2. I have been told in other patches to prefer the Windows API, as opposed to whatever compatibility layer may be provided by a compiler.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n1. Either the code is not actually getting compiled on 32-bit because it doesn't support the code paths that expose the test OR\r\n2. The compiler at http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/ does not provide the sleep() compatibility function.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
