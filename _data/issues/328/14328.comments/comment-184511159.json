	"body": "What happened is that in GCC 5 the default compilation mode changed to C11 mode (https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-5/changes.html, see the note about -std=gnu11).  In C11, an implicit function declaration is an error by default.  In versions of C before C99, it is not.\r\n\r\nTo fix this we need to add an explicit declaration of sleep in misc/cgo/test/callback_c.c.  Or it might be even simpler to copy sleep_windows_386.go into callback_c.c, since we already have a `#ifdef` in the latter anyhow.",
