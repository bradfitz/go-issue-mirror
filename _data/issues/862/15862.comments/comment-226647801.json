	"body": "We set the flags in the ELF header in `parseArmAttributes` in cmd/link/internal/ld/ldelf.go.  But this issue is not about the ELF header, it's about the ARM attributes section.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know the Go toolchain never generates an ARM attributes section.  In this case we are talking about `-buildmode=c-shared`, so the actual shared library is being generated by the system linker.  The system linker is most likely merging the ARM attributes sections of the input files, in this case from files like crt1.o.\r\n\r\nThe fix will probably be for the Go linker to generate an ARM attributes section when producing the go.o file to pass to the external linker.\r\n\r\n@ClarkGuan Does this actually make a difference?",
