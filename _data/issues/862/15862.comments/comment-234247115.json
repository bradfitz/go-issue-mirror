Just one problem in my Android dev job leads me to care about using which ARM Architecture to build the shared library. I think it's an issue just because using \"GOARM=7\" but readelf cmd says NOT. So if the instructions are truly ARMv7 style, I don't care the .ARM.attributes exists or not in the ELF file.",
