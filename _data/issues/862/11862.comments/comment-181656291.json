I think @rsc was saying that the solution here is non trivial (and it's not just `filepath.Glob` but also `path.Match`).\r\n\r\nI'd like it to stay on the list. Coming from other languages, I think this is a pretty common feature for glob syntax.\r\n\r\nNote that the downside of attempting to write your own implementation is that I think you would wind up re-implementing glob entirely. I'm trying to figure out how to solve this for http://github.com/jstemmer/gotags since it won't be solved in the standard library anytime soon.",
