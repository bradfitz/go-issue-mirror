The HTTP\r\n    // client code always uses either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.\r\n    // See the docs on Transport for details.\r\n    Proto      string // \"HTTP/1.0\"\r\n    ProtoMajor int    // 1\r\n    ProtoMinor int    // 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for your,\r\n\r\n```go\r\n        Header: http.Header{\r\n            \"Connection\": []string{\"close\"},\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's not really a header that Go code is supposed to set manually. That's one of the ones managed for you. Note the `Request.Close` boolean, which is how you're supposed to control that.\r\n\r\nDid this break real code or was this hypothetical, an experiment after seeing the previous commits and bugs about similar things?\r\n\r\nWe can update docs, but unless this broke real code, we'd rather not change any code behavior after we did the rc2 release.",
