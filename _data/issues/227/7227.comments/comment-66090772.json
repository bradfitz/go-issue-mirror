When I set both of those, the code works fine.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/1idbOzCTUu\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/1idbOzCTUu\u003c/a\u003e\n\nAs I described above, Go requires that signals be delivered on the alternate signal\nstack set up by sigaltstack.  I forgot to say that when using sigaction you need to use\nthe SA_ONSTACK flag.  When C code sets up a signal handler that does not use SA_ONSTACK,\nand when that signal is delivered to a thread that is running Go code, the program can\ncrash.\n\nI don't know how to fix this.  The Go code does not in general have a large enough stack\nto run a signal handler.\u003c/pre\u003e",
