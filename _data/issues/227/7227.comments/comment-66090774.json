In some cases the signal is not delivered on the signal stack, and the\noverflow check fails.  The crash then occurs when the stack split code sees (in effect)\nthat it is running on a stack that is not expected to overflow.\n\nI'm not sure why my program in comment #36 fails on Darwin, it does run successfully on\nGNU/Linux.\u003c/pre\u003e",
