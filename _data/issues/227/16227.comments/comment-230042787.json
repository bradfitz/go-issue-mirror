But false positives are worse than false negatives: They cause annoyance, they can cause people to write worse code to silence the tool, and worst of all, they can cause people to stop using the tool altogether. Unless the false positive rate is extremely low for a check, it's better for the check not to go in. I'd suggest that allowing assignment where the RHS is a struct literal in which all lock fields are zero is going to be a net win, taking into account both false positives and false negatives and their relative weight.\r\n",
