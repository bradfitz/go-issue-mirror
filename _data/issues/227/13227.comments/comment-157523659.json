The only other way I found for munmap to fail is for the kernel itself to run out of memory.\r\n\r\nAnother way you can test this without patching in 1.5.2 is to run `sysctl vm.max_map_count=131072` as root. This will double the limit on the number of mapped areas. But patching in 1.5.2 would be a better test if that's easy enough.",
