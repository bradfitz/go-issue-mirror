	"body": "Thanks for the strace output. Unfortunately, it looks like you ran strace without -f, so it only got the system calls from one thread and it wasn't the thread that caused the crash :(\r\n\r\nIn addition to -f, you may want to run with -e mmap,mmap2,munmap to filter down to just those calls. Otherwise your log may get very large after a few hours.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, since it seems like this is fully reproducible (but somewhat painful) and it's highly likely 1.5.2 fixes this, you could just try 1.5.2.",
