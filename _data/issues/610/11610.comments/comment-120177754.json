Here is the test:\r\nhttps://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz/blob/master/examples/gotypes/main.go\r\nYou can add llgo to the party as well.\r\nUnfortunately it is quite messy because of all of the existing bugs. But what you can do is to compare llgo only to go/types (and exclude gc and gccgo invocations). If/when you run go-fuzz use -workdir=examples/goast because that dir contains an excessive corpus of inputs.\r\n\r\n",
