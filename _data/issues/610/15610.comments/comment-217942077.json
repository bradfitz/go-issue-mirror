	"body": "This seems like a legit, albeit niche, inconsistency to me.  If Test's declaration is changed from `type Test *Test` to `type Test struct { p *Test }` or `type Test [1]*Test` and makeTest is updated accordingly, then DeepEqual returns immediately.  There's nothing in DeepEqual's godocs to suggest this inconsistency is / should be present.\r\n\r\nThe obvious fix is to simply relax the deepEqualValue's \"hard\" predicate to include Ptr-Kinded Values. Downside is this would probably grow the number of entries needed in the visited map for typical programs that don't create cycles using only pointer types.\r\n\r\nI suspect we can fix it somehow without regressing typical programs though.\r\n\r\n@gavv How did you discover this problem? Do you have a real-world application that's negatively affected by it?",
