	"body": "The comment in the Chromium test case is interesting: \"This matches IE/Firefox, even though it seems a bit wrong.\" Maybe that behaviour _is_ wrong.\r\n\r\nOne more from the Chromium test case: Chromium treats `domain=.1.2.3.4` as an illegal domain attribute. But if you follow RFC 6265 (as package cookiejar tries to) you would chop off the leading trail first (see 5.3.2), even before domain matching it. Chromiums behaviour here is not RFC 6265 compliant no matter if RFC 6265 allows domain cookies on IP addresses or not.\r\n\r\nAs I said RFC 6265 is not clear here.\r\n\r\nI think silently converting the domain cookie to a host cookie is okay, but I do not think that domain cookies on IP addresses make sense at all.\r\n\r\nWould you have time to test the behaviour on Chrome, FF, IE, Safari and curl? I thinks showing that all these \"browsers\" handle domain attributes equal to the request IP address the same would add considerable weight to the proposed change.",
