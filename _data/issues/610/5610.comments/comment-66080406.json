Conceptually, syscall.Setenv\nincorrectly turned my \"set an envar to an empty string\" request into a \"delete an envar\"\nrequest.\n\nYour patch is cleaner, more robust, and solves the issue on my 32bit xp sp3 and win7\nsystems. I'm double checking on other systems of interest, but don't expect any\nregressions.\n\nJon\u003c/pre\u003e",
