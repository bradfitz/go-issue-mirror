The check that's failing is quite general.\r\n\r\nCan you run and reproduce the problem with GODEBUG=gccheckmark=1? Also, it sounds like you can reproduce it fairly quickly. If that's right, I'd also like to know whether it happens with GODEBUG=gcstoptheworld=1,gcshrinkstackoff=1 and, if that stops it from happening, what happens with GODEBUG=gcstackbarrieroff=1.\r\n\r\nAlso, is there use of \"unsafe\" in your code? And is it possible to share the code or reduce it to a shareable test case?",
