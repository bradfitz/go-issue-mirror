We've even tinkered with ways of enforcing these rules, but so far no concrete changes have come of that.\r\n\r\n\u003e I wonder if automated tooling can be written that just detects if the last usage of a variable in some function is in an unsafe.Pointer(\u0026var) kind of form.\r\n\r\nI know that go vet does some checking of unsafe.Pointer use, though I'm not sure what exactly.",
