	"body": "@herenowcoder I've never used or heard of your use case. That certainly doesn't mean it is invalid; it sounds interesting.\r\n\r\nEvery time I've looked into this I've found that databases don't support nested transactions, they support savepoints. MySql and Postgresql only support savepoints. MS SQL Server kinda supports nested transactions, but not really (the outer transaction rules the inner one, the inner one doesn't even count), but again it does fully support save points.\r\n\r\nMy takeaway is that savepoints are what databases are doing, not nested transactions.\r\n\r\n * Question 1: Does your understanding match with the above?\r\n * Question 2: Are you saying regardless of the above, you would still want to emulate nested transactions?\r\n * Question 3: From my point of view, SQLAlchemy, Ecto, and ActiveRecord are more sql frameworks, similar to what other go packages provide on top of database/sql. Is this also your understanding?\r\n",
