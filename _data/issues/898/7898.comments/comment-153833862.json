There is also no code, nor anyone signed up to write the code. Therefore this will not be in Go 1.6.\n\nMoving this to the proposal process, since it seems like that more clearly reflect the current status. The next step would be to write a design doc outlining the approach to take. See golang.org/s/proposal for details. Thanks.",
