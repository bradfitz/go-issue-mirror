I was puzzled by my example program where\nwrite to *x has write barrier because the compiler doesn't know\nwhether it's stack slot or heap slot.\n\nif the huge stack is not just a single frame, then i think we can be\nsure that writes to bottom stack slots are using writer barriers, so\nperhaps we do have a way to know if we need to scan the whole\nstack or not during mark termination.\n",
