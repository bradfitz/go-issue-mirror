	"body": "You still need to re-scan all of the frames that were created since the concurrent scan. Any of those frames can still contain a pointer to a white heap object. The stack barriers I'm implementing will tell the GC which set of frames have been created since the first scan of the stack and hence need to be rescanned.\r\n\r\nThe fact that writes to up-pointers generate write barriers may simplify things, though. I was thinking I could only install stack barriers at frames where there are no pointers to higher frames (which is easy to compute, but does restrict where stack barriers can be installed, especially in examples like minux's). But if there are write barriers for these (and we don't simply ignore those write barriers like we do now), then I could install stack barriers wherever I want and use the write barrier to change the watermark if there's a write to a higher frame via a pointer.",
