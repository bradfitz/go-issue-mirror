	"body": "I spoke to @rsc about this and it is WAI. build.Import finds empty directories because it might be used to figure out where a package \"should\" live (e.g. so that you can then place files in that directory). Whereas it does *not* find empty directories in vendor/ because they would shadow non-vendored non-empty directories. For example, if you vendor `net/http/httptest`, you will have an \"empty\" `vendor/net/http` directory (save the `httptest` subdirectory), and you do not want that empty `vendor/net/http` to replace the standard library's `net/http`.\r\n\r\nAgain, is there a particular place where you feel this logic breaks something?",
