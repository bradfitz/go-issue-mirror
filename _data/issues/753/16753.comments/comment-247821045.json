I wasn't sure if the package name where `io.Reader` comes from there was needed.\r\n\r\nIt's not needed for structs, because you can't do:\r\n\r\n```Go\r\ntype Some struct {\r\n\tio.Reader\r\n\tfoo.Reader\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Build error: duplicate field Reader\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it's valid for interfaces, as long as the embedded interfaces contain non-repeating methods. So, this is possible:\r\n\r\n```Go\r\ntype Some interface {\r\n    io.Reader\r\n    foo.Reader\r\n}\r\n\r\n// No build error (as long as there are no duplicate methods in those 2 interfaces)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, unfortunately, it seems that it's needed to keep the package name `io` there.",
