A slide out panel containing the index is displayed on the left side \nof the screen.\n4. The slide out panel covers the right panel which has the description \nand text until the menu box is clicked a second time.\n5. This makes it unnecessarily difficult to read sequential topis such \nas \"Slices --\u003e Slicing slices --\u003e Making slices......\"\n6. While the center vertical divider bar can be adjusted to show more of \nthe text, the test does not wrap---it is hidden behind the menu.\n\nIMO, the biggest cause of stress, and therefore subliminal \ndissatisfaction and frustration, with many web sites is that they \ndistract the user from what they are trying to do with fancy, glitzy \ndisplay formatting.\n\nThe content and information in the Tour of Go is overall nicely \npresented, well organized, and simple to follow.  The menu could perhaps \nbe designed differently so that it does not cover up the information the \nuser is really interested in.\n\nThank you\nRalph Moses\n\nOn 7/17/2015 7:16 AM, a.donizetti wrote:\n\u003e\n\u003e     of the page\n\u003e\n\u003e What page? tour.golang.org ?\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub \n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/11753#issuecomment-122258543\u003e.\n\u003e\n\u003e ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003e\n\u003e Spam \n\u003e \u003chttps://antispam.roaringpenguin.com/canit/b.php?i=0aORogXfh\u0026m=974c32a8ec3a\u0026t=20150717\u0026c=s\u003e\n\u003e Phish/Fraud \n\u003e \u003chttps://antispam.roaringpenguin.com/canit/b.php?i=0aORogXfh\u0026m=974c32a8ec3a\u0026t=20150717\u0026c=p\u003e\n\u003e Not spam \n\u003e \u003chttps://antispam.roaringpenguin.com/canit/b.php?i=0aORogXfh\u0026m=974c32a8ec3a\u0026t=20150717\u0026c=n\u003e\n\u003e Forget previous vote \n\u003e \u003chttps://antispam.roaringpenguin.com/canit/b.php?i=0aORogXfh\u0026m=974c32a8ec3a\u0026t=20150717\u0026c=f\u003e\n\n",
