The definition has always been what it is now:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// IsAbs reports whether the URL is absolute.                                                                                                     \r\nfunc (u *URL) IsAbs() bool {\r\n        return u.Scheme != \"\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlus I disagree that `//example.com` is absolute. It's relative to the scheme, so it's still relative.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can just document it more. Feel free to send a change.\r\n",
