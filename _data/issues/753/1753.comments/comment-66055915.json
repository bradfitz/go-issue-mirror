I think I actually ended up doing it as\nyou suggested.  Also I think I keep the buffers around for the right length of time in\nmy package, but maybe you can tell me otherwise.\n\nThe code works for some time before it crashes, so it seems like a memory issue (instead\nof a complete failure) and I can read and write data on the serial port for a while\nbefore it crashes.\n\nThanks,\nTarmigan\u003c/pre\u003e",
