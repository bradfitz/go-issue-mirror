The \"events\"\nDWORD whose address gets passed to WaitCommEvent needs to exist until the\nGetOverLappedResults returns.  I could post my updated code, but yours is cleaner anyway.\n\nFor what it's worth, you'd have my vote for a serial package.  In my mind, a serial port\nis a lot like a network port and go is a great language for low level binary\ncommunications that often happen over serial ports.\n\nPlease close this bug.\n\nThanks,\nTarmigan\u003c/pre\u003e",
