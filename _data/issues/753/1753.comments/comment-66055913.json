But the most likely reason your code is in exception\nhandler is because you have a bug in your program. If you use overlapped io on windows,\nyou have to be very careful how you manage io buffers - remember, once you started io\nyou have to keep io buffer around until io completes or is cancelled. Go garbadge\ncollector knows nothing about your pending io, and, if it reuses io buffer memory,\nWindows will be writing over things it is not meant to.\n\nIt would be helpful for me to see your code. If you could provide small program to\ndemonstrate. Perhaps 2 programs talking to each other over serial port. I'm sure, I\ncould find PC with serial ports. Thank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-windows**._\n\n_Owner changed to @alexbrainman._",
