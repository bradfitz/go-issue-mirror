I still believe, it is memory corruption by your program.\nBut I looked at your code and can't put finger on it. So, I wrote my own version. You\ncan try it at your own risk. There are many things still missing for a full serial port\nsupport. Just patch current go tree with serial.diff attached and rebuild. Then you\nshould be able to compile main.go, which is sligtly modified version of yours. I have no\nplans to submit serial port support for inclusion into Go, I doubt there is anyone else\nbut you and me who might find it usefull.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1753/9/main.go\"\u003emain.go\u003c/a\u003e (1920 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1753/9/serial.diff\"\u003eserial.diff\u003c/a\u003e (17338 bytes)",
