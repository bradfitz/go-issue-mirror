I think I sent an email to\ngolang-dev about it, but I got no response.  I would LOVE for someone who is familiar\nwith windows to look at it.\n\nI would like to publish it as a package once I have tested it and cleaned it up a bit\nmore.  Would there be any chance that this could be accepted as an os/serial package?\n\nThanks,\nTarmigan\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1753/4/serial_windows.go\"\u003eserial_windows.go\u003c/a\u003e (6310 bytes)",
