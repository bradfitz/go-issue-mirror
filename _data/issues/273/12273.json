	"body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIt seems that it is not possible to build an Android application from Go source code if there is a dash (`-`) somewhere in the Go package name. Since my organization on GitHub has a dash inside, this means I cannot build any Android applications whatsoever.\r\n\r\nYou can easily test this with the currently available Go 1.5 release version. \r\n\r\n0. Take the `golang.org/x/mobile/example/basic` example application and move it to the `golang.org/x/mobile/example/basic-demo` folder.\r\n0. Run `gomobile build -target=android golang.org/x/mobile/example/basic-demo` command.\r\n0. Run the `adb install basic-demo` command.\r\n\r\nYou will get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n6927 KB/s (3293500 bytes in 0.464s)\r\n\tpkg: /data/local/tmp/basic-demo.apk\r\nFailure [INSTALL_FAILED_INVALID_APK]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, you might ask me why didn't I use the `gomobile install` command instead. There seems to be another issue as well. If you run the `gomobile install` command, you will not receive any output to the terminal at all. Furthermore, you will even get an exit code of `0`. It seems that the `gomobile` command hides any issues coming from the `adb` command.\r\n\r\nMy best guess is that somewhere in the manifest you place the package name. At least for Java based applications, I know that they don't allow dashes in the package names and you are advised to substitute those with underscores.

This is just a hunch, I might be totally off base.",
