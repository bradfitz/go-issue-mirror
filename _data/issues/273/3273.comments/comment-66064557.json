I like the solution used by GoPkgDoc.\nIt has better discoverability. At the bottom of a package page,\nyou find the following message:\n\n  GoPkgDoc generated this page from the XXX source code just now. ‚ü≤\n\nOn mouse-over, the circular arrow shows the message\n\n  \"Refresh this page from the source\"\n  \nWould it be possible to offer something similar?\u003c/pre\u003e",
