Also, not\neveryone will be able to restart the server. I'm sure some godoc servers will be guarded\nby systems managers... :)\n\nIf it's not feasible to regenerate the listings, a stopgap measure would be to turn the\ntimestamps flag on by default. Then the behavior will at least be transparent.\u003c/pre\u003e",
