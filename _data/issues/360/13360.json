	"body": "Just a reminder.\r\n\r\nThe commit adb1e030136f14ef8434930f15a04a74568a5948 leaves the issue on calculation of Pv6 common prefix length. It assumes that there's no prefix longer than 64-bit. Of course the assumption is wrong. We perhaps see that some network operators want to use /96 for IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.",
