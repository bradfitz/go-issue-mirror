I'm able to access the slide at http://localhost:8080/methods/11\r\n\r\nThe code on the slide imports `golang.org/x/tour/reader`. When I change the `Validate()` function to something obviously wrong (e.g. `fmt.Println(\"NOT OK!\"); return`) and then rerun the program, I still get `\"OK!\"` as the output. This also happens after restarting the development app server.\r\n\r\nI came across some very old references that mentioned that the app engine SDK wasn't aware of workspaces, but that seems to have been fixed for well over two years now (https://blog.golang.org/the-app-engine-sdk-and-workspaces-gopath).\r\n\r\nDid something get compiled to a cache somewhere that I should be clearing out?\r\n\r\n",
