Also if you have any background\ngoroutines/times, the deadlock detector is effectively disabled. Also the most dangerous\ndeadlocks are the ones that do not happen yet (potential deadlocks).\nSo I am not sure how much it's worth fixing in this form.\nIt would be awesome to implement a deadlock detector for partial and/or potential\ndeadlocks, but there is not theory exist for that.\u003c/pre\u003e",
