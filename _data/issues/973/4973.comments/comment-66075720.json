Sadly, it feels like this really degrades the whole deadlock detector\nexperience, since anything that imports net has this issue.\n\nIn our project it's every single binary because stuff at the lowest level imports a log\npackage that imports net, and we also have some cgo packages that we need for some\nLinux-specific stuff.\n\nI know it's probably even worse, but how about a specific function in the runtime or\nruntime/cgo package that starts this goroutine? That way only the 1% of people that\nreally need it will have to pay this cost? I don't think net's cgo parts even do\ncallbacks?\n\nOr maybe there's a way to start the goroutine the first time C calls back into Go?\nProbably not.\u003c/pre\u003e",
