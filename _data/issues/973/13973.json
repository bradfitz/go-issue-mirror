	"body": "Go version 1.5.3, reproduced both with official `go1.5.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz` package and toolchain built from source also on Linux/AMD64.\r\n\r\nWhen I use an RSA key with an unusual size, say 1028 or 1032 bits, I often encounter a panic in math/big: `math/big: mismatched montgomery number lengths`. The frequency of the occurrence seems to depend on the keysize but many such panics can be observed in 100 runs.\r\n\r\nThis does not occur with more common key sizes, say powers of two or small integer multiples of 256. I have attached a small program that can be used to observe and reproduce the issue.\r\n[mont.zip](https://github.com/golang/go/files/92096/mont.zip)\r\n\r\n",
