And, for the reference, at GopherCon 2014, Rob Pike made the comment explicitly: \"The language is done\".\r\n\r\nAlso, you are making the assumption that your suggestion is an \"improvement\". That is far from certain. To be clear, the current rules were carefully thought out and are deliberate. You can be assured that we thought about your suggestion during the design of the language (between 2007 and 2009). If your suggestion were permitted, what about f(g(), h()) where both g and h return multiple values that happen to match the parameter list of f? Should probably be permitted as well. And then we should also allow things like: \"a, b, c, d := f(), g()\" otherwise we have another inconsistency. And so forth. Permitting this is of course possible, but it also opens the door for unexpected errors. For instance, the parameter lists of the functions may change in unexpected ways and the code may still work, hiding errors. So the _pragmatic_ solution here is to allow a small set of rules that are reasonably safe, and _not_ to allow everything that might be possible.\r\n\r\nBut again, please move this discussion elsewhere. If you have a concrete proposal, please follow the proposal process: https://github.com/golang/proposal .\r\n\r\nThanks.",
