Therefore, since Printf takes a\nstring argument first, the program here is erroneous.  It's debatable whether the spec\nadmits Printf(multipleReturnValues()) or Println(multipleReturnValues) but I think the\nanswer is still  no and in any case that narrow case is not what the report is about.\n\nIn short, addressing this requires a change to the spec.  It should be clarified to\nprevent or perhaps admit even the narrower interpretation.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
