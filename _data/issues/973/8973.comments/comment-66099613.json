OS X has a separate dwarf linker. ld is supposed to add\nreferences to all .o files into the executable. Then you can run dsymutil to read all\nthe .o files mentioned in the binary and combine the debug info into a .dwarf file. I've\ngot a patch that seems to get the debug info into the correct format for a mach o object\nfile, but for some reason ld doesn't include it in the list of the .o files, so the info\njust disappears.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.5**, removed **release-go1.4**._",
