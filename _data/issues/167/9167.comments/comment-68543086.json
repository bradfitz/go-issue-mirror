I opened this bug and I am not against making it Windows only but I don't think it is necessary. \r\n\r\nOn Unix, there is no common cases where it will happen but it does still cause odd behavior. See this https://play.golang.org/p/Av1p6SXVzZ . This is such an odd case in Unix I would not have reported it but if we are fixing windows I don't see why leave this issue for Unix, since it will still work. If you do decide to move out join to be platform dependent, you should also look to make `Clean()` and/or `volumeNameLen` also platform dependent.\r\n\r\n",
