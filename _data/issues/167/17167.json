	"body": "Recently we added a -bench flag to cmd/compile to benchmark compiler phases.  It might be interesting if the builders used this flag and then persisted the output file so we could monitor compiler performance over time.\r\n\r\nThere's a risk that measuring the standard library compile time is confounded with changes to the standard library, but I think only a couple packages (runtime, net, net/http) still seem under active development.  So it's probably still a decent signal.\r\n\r\n/cc @bradfitz @griesemer ",
