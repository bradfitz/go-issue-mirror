The individual measurements indicate the package being compiled.\r\n\r\nI would probably tweak all.bash so that the \"go install std cmd\" step adds -gcflags=\"-bench=/tmp/bench.txt\" on the builders, and then save /tmp/bench.txt somewhere we can easily collect and analyze.\r\n\r\nI think benchmarking the Go1 benchmarks' compile times would be nice too, since they're a fixed target.",
