(hg identify)\n\n0dc6198e4ff3 tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThe source code says:\n\nfunc isDomainName(s string) bool {\n\t// Requirements on DNS name:\n\t//\t* must not be empty.\n\t//\t* must be alphanumeric plus - and .\n\t//\t* each of the dot-separated elements must begin\n\t//\t  and end with a letter or digit.\n\t//\t  RFC 1035 required the element to begin with a letter,\n\t//\t  but RFC 3696 says this has been relaxed to allow digits too.\n\t//\t  still, there must be a letter somewhere in the entire name.\n\nBut this is quite misleading:\n\n1) RFC 1035 never *required* names to be \u0026quot;alphanumeric plus - and .\u0026quot; RFC 1035,\nsection 2.3.1 \u0026quot;Preferred name syntax\u0026quot; just says it is the *preferred* syntax. \n\n2) RFC 2181 made very clear in section 11 \u0026quot;Name syntax\u0026quot; that domain names can\nbe anything (for instance, the _ is quite common, I do not even mention IDN)\n\n3) The relaxation you mention (allowing a leading digit) was in RFC 1123, section 2.1\n\u0026quot;Host Names and Numbers\u0026quot; and is about *HOST* names, not *DOMAIN* names. Host\nnames have much stricter rules.\u003c/pre\u003e",
