I am using\nwindows-386, but I tried it on both 32bit and 64bit versions of Windows. Is it possible\nfor you to try it on different pc? Just build the test and copy it somewhere else and\nrun. If it works, perhaps you pc is configured in a particular way that triggers this\nbug. It would be nice to know how.\n\nI am also ccing Brad. Perhaps he has some ideas.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
