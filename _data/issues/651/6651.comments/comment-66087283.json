Wouldn't you\nneed to know if Query() succeeded before attempting to fetch result records?\n\nNo, that's my point exactly.  Consider the following query:\n\n    SELECT (SELECT 1 FROM bar WHERE bar.f1 = foo.f1) FROM foo;\n\nIt's an error for that subquery to return more than one row, but it's impossible to know\nwhether it does that or not without actually fetching results from the query.  Unless it\nactually starts fetching the results, Query() can't possibly know whether the query\nsucceeded or not.\n\nNow: why is it okay for database/sql to ignore the error from Next()?\u003c/pre\u003e",
