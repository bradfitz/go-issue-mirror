It just always happened to work because I always happened to be using well-known intermediate certificate authorities.\r\n\r\nAlas I have discovered the error of my ways with a little help from openssl.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nopenssl s_client -showcerts -connect example.com:443 -servername example.com -CAfile /path/to/root.pem\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow embarrassing. My entire life is a lie... I'm gonna go cry in the bathroom now.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThanks so much for all the help.
