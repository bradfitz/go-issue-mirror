	"body": "@anforowicz if you run \"go test -x ...\" command, you will see what go command does in full details - paths and all. All paths must be less then 260 characters on Windows, see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247%28v=vs.85%29.aspx for details. Nothing we can do about the limitation. Just use shorter path in your GOPATH. Note how \"go test\" makes your path more then twice as long when it builds test source files, so really your paths should be less then 100 or something. Closing as unfortunate.\r\n\r\n@minux I tried changing \"go test\" logic to use shorter paths in the past. It turned out too complicated, and I decided it is not worth the trouble.\r\n\r\nAlex",
