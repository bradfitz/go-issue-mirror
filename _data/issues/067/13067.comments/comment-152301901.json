That explains why no explicit knobs yet exist.\r\n\r\nBut in this case it seems a potential knob already does exist: the database DSN string. Your driver could support a hint in there.\r\n\r\nOr your driver could notice the result set is huge and buffer more, if it's buffering at all.\r\n\r\nBefore we do anything, I'd want to hear from the driver author first and make sure they've done the optimizations on their side.",
