	"body": "A relevant issue is that we're not regenerating the GL display and surface after the orientation change. Android NDK seem to have a bug (or a feature) not to invoke onNativeWindowResized callback when device is rotated. onConfigurationChanged could have been alternative handler to resize the surface and call glViewport with the new width and height.\r\n\r\n(Unlike onNativeWindowResized, onConfigurationChanged doesn't provide a reference to the current ANativeWindow object. Regenerating the display and the surface with the previous window reference may not work perfectly.)",
