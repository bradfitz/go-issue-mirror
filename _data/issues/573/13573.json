	"body": "The go1.html file found in the net repository:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/html/testdata/go1.html\r\n\r\n...contains the following text implying that the HTML itself is licensed under \"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\":\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u003cdiv id=\"footer\"\u003e\r\nBuild version go1.0.1.\u003cbr\u003e\r\nExcept as \u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/policies.html#restrictions\"\u003enoted\u003c/a\u003e,\r\nthe content of this page is licensed under the\r\nCreative Commons Attribution 3.0 License,\r\nand code is licensed under a \u003ca href=\"/LICENSE\"\u003eBSD license\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003ca href=\"/doc/tos.html\"\u003eTerms of Service\u003c/a\u003e | \r\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/privacy-policy.html\"\u003ePrivacy Policy\u003c/a\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it does not specify whether that is the US version (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/) or the unported version (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).  I'm assuming the US version.  This is also slightly confusing as the LICENSE file found at the top of the net repository would lead many to believe that the HTML files fall under the standard 3-Clause BSD license that Go typically uses.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the real issue appears to be that the policies.html page referenced in the footer text no longer exists, so it's unclear what license should apply to this content.",
