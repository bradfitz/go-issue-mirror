This is caused\nby a lingering reference to the original foo.messages on the stack, perhaps left by the\ncreation of the original channel during func main. The problem is that stack frames are\nnot collected precisely, so garbage like that can be misinterpreted as live. We had\nhoped to fix this for Go 1.2, but it was not ready in time. It's on the slate for Go 1.3.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Duplicate**._\n\n_Merged into issue #909._",
