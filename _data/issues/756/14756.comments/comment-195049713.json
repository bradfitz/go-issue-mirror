	"body": "Hi @ianlancetaylor, \r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to triage my first Golang proposal. If it would help I could go ahead and create a patch for the proposed changes as there are only stubs in the Golang playground. The contribution guide stated to first submit an issue for discussion, and so I did. However, it should also not be too difficult to start patching [encoding/json/encode.go#L1033](https://golang.org/src/encoding/json/encode.go?s=#L1033) in order to facilitate discussion either. \r\n\r\nThank you again.",
