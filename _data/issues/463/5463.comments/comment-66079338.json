The ldflags are not considered in the \"do we rebuild\" decision. \n\nIf you remove the memcached output file between the two commands I believe you will see\nthe results you expect. Please let us know.\n\nThe second example works because you are using go build on a single source file. When\nyou name files on the command line, that's not an official package and it is always\nrebuilt.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
