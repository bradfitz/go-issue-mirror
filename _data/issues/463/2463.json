It will\neventually crash with an \u0026quot;out of memory\u0026quot; failure.\n\nIt's easy to work around it by using Readdir() directly in a loop, \nwith a more sensible buffer size, but it seems like it shouldn't leak. \n\nAlso see code at \u003ca href=\"http://pastie.org/2864265\"\u003ehttp://pastie.org/2864265\u003c/a\u003e\n\nTo reproduce: compile and run the program using the 8g version mentioned above on\nWindows. I tried it on Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2463/0/leak.go\"\u003eleak.go\u003c/a\u003e (571 bytes)",
