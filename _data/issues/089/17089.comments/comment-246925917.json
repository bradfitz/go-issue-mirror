You probably don't want to count those, they contribute nothing to CPU load (but do consume some memory).\r\n\r\nIt is not clear whether you should count goroutines in the Gsyscall state.  Whether you want to count them depends on whether they are doing real work in the syscall (reading a large file, say) or waiting (read on an idle network socket).  I don't think the runtime has the information needed to make that call, although we might be able to make some approximation.  That's what makes this problem hard.",
