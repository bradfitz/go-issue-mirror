	"body": "by **eparis@parisplace.org**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThis is golang 1.3\n\nI am unable to go install any application where the pkg/.../*.a files do not exist and I\ndo not have write permission to the pkg directory associated with a dependency's src\ndirectory.  In my case my imports live in /usr/share/gocode/src and I do not have\npermission to create .a files in /usr/share/gocode/pkg.  Go build works just fine, go\ninstall refuses to give me a runnable binary even though it had no meaningful failure. \nI didn't ask go install to lay down the .a files, it decided to do that on its own.  It\ncan accomplish the task I ask for without doing so (it did build them in $WORK).  I'd be\nhappy with a 'ignore failures on dependencies' flag...    (I want to use go install\ninstead of go build because i am building a bunch of things at once and doing go build\ninteratively is a lot slower.)\n\nAn example is below....\n \n$ cat src/test/test.go\npackage main\n \nimport (\n        _ \u0026quot;github.com/coreos/go-etcd/etcd\u0026quot;\n)\n \nfunc main() {\n        println(\u0026quot;wooo!\u0026quot;)\n}\n \nThe dependancy *.go exists in /usr/share/gocode/src, but the .a files in pkg do NOT exist\n \n$ ls -ld /usr/share/gocode/src/github.com/coreos/go-etcd\n/usr/share/gocode/pkg/linux_amd64/github.com/coreos/go-etcd\nls: cannot access /usr/share/gocode/pkg/linux_amd64/github.com/coreos/go-etcd: No such\nfile or directory\ndrwxr-xr-x. 5 root root 4096 Jul 22 09:34\n/usr/share/gocode/src/github.com/coreos/go-etcd/\n \nUse go build:\n \n$ GOPATH=$GOPATH:`pwd`:/usr/share/gocode go build -o bin/test test\n$ ./bin/test\nwooo!\n \nUse go install:\n \n$ GOPATH=$GOPATH:`pwd`:/usr/share/gocode go install test\ngo install github.com/coreos/go-etcd/etcd: mkdir\n/usr/share/gocode/pkg/linux_amd64/github.com/coreos: permission denied\n$ echo $?\n1\n \nRunning as root works:\n \n# GOPATH=$GOPATH:`pwd`:/usr/share/gocode go install test\n[root@dhcp137-216 mygo]# echo $?\n0\n \nAfter that a normal user can build the package (since the root process laid down the .a\nfiles)\n \n$ GOPATH=$GOPATH:`pwd`:/usr/share/gocode go install test\n$ echo $?\n0\u003c/pre\u003e",
