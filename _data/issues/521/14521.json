What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"darwin\"\r\nGOOS=\"darwin\"\r\nCC=\"clang\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fno-caret-diagnostics -Qunused-arguments -fmessage-length=0 -fno-common\"\r\nCXX=\"clang++\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n(Use play.golang.org to provide a runnable example, if possible.)\r\n\r\nSorry in advance, I am not able to extract a runnable example at the moment as it is a larger program I am debugging.\r\n\r\nI am having issues with the GC in Go. Specifically, it does not seem to release idle heap memory back to the system, even after +10 minutes of inactivity (based on [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24376817/go-1-3-garbage-collector-not-releasing-server-memory-back-to-system)) in the code/area that generated the initial garabage in the program.\r\n\r\nHeap in use and allocated match one another (makes sense).\r\nHeap sys = heap idle (this does not make sense to me).\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nHeap idle to decrease.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nHeap idle does not decrease over time. I even called `runtime.GC()` and then `debug.FreeOSMemory()` as well in attempt to release the memory.\r\n\r\nOther information\r\nMemory profile information from MemStats logged every 2 seconds:\r\n![picture1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3250776/13348283/65f2d406-dc27-11e5-9199-5212755bfbe1.png)\r\n\r\nI did reading of different sources and it one thought I see is that the GC may release memory, but it is up to the OS to collect/ask for it. Is this correct? Does this mean the memory footprint will not decrease without external intervention?\r\n\r\nI thought maybe this problem has to do with #13552, however from 1.5 to 1.6 made no difference for me.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.",
