You\ncan't have a package that is both cgo and SWIG.\n\nWith \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/14369043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/14369043\u003c/a\u003e your code works.\n\nFor 1.3 we are going to have to change SWIG itself to support external linking, and then\nchange the go tool to use that rather than shared libraries.\u003c/pre\u003e",
