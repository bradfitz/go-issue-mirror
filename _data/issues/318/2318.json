(hg identify)\nweekly.2011-09-21\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nYou can reproduce this by compiling \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/nsf/gocode\"\u003ehttps://github.com/nsf/gocode\u003c/a\u003e, then when you run the\ntests, it hangs, because of the open pipes of the server.\n\nIt is easy to fix, if you want, I can write a patch.\u003c/pre\u003e",
