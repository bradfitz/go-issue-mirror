Initially I though that this piece of code could be the culprit:\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/mobile/blob/master/example/basic/main.go#L79-L89\r\n\r\nSince on high level look (not sure what happens underneath) it allows the `Paint-\u003eStop-\u003ePaint` sequence to occur, I though it was resulting in a `Paint` call being called on a hidden surface. However, I could not reproduce it with the `example` application above and even after wrapping the whole thing with an if could not get my case not to crash.",
