	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCurrent signal handling functionality in the runtime handles all signals, preventing\ndefault behavior for SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, and SIGTTOU.  One proximate effect of this is\nthat Ctrl-Z from a unix shell does not suspend any Go process that handles signals.\n \nIt might be generally convenient to have a way to catch only a specific \nsubset of all signals, and to have some set of signals have their \ndefault behaviour. \n\nIt might also occasionally be convenient to have a way to catch a \nsignal and then to invoke the signal's default behaviour, or to deliver another signal\nto itself or another process.\u003c/pre\u003e",
