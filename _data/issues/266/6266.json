Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. get\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/DeMLinkS/demlinks/blob/501b227a8a22dfe0c0b2855073a16b5df0ab52d9/poc/simpletest/a_test.go\"\u003ehttps://github.com/DeMLinkS/demlinks/blob/501b227a8a22dfe0c0b2855073a16b5df0ab52d9/poc/simpletest/a_test.go\u003c/a\u003e\n2. put it in folder: %GOPATH%\\src\\github.com\\DeMLinkS\\demlinks\\poc\\simpletest\\\ntechnically you can put it in another folder/structure but this path is encoded in the\ncode\n3. go into the folder where a_test.go is\n4. uncomment line 13 , that t.FailNow()\n5. run `go test -work`\n6. go to your %TEMP% and rename the gobuild### that was just created by 4.\nrename it to: test1\n7. backup the test1 folder ie. copy to test2 (so you can repeat the test by renaming\ntest2 to test1 when test1 is gone because is being removed by the running test)\n8. go into source code and comment line 13, // t.FailNow()\n9. run `go test`\n10. notice the test1 folder is not deleted and there's only the .exe left inside\n11. run `go test` again and now test1 folder is deleted\n12. copy test2(your test1 backup) as test1 folder\n13. go into code and uncomment line 27 so that time sleep 2 sec happens\n14. run `go test`\n15. notice the folder is deleted\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows 7 64bit\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version devel +1e3289919b26 Tue Aug 27 21:18:32 2013 +0200 windows/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nthis is me trying to reproduce what actually happens when running `go test`, the gobuild\nfolder is not deleted, the .exe is still inside\n\nthe problem happens at line:\n\u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/cmd/go/test.go#887\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/cmd/go/test.go#887\u003c/a\u003e\nerr := cmd.Start()\nwhen the test .exe is getting executed\n\nand the relevant delete of the gobuild### folder happens at\n\u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/cmd/go/test.go#970\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/cmd/go/test.go#970\u003c/a\u003e\nos.RemoveAll(testDir)\n\nthis is the one that fails to delete the folder because \u0026quot;Access denied.\u0026quot;,\nexact error is:\nremove\nC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\go-build263505467\\github.com\\DeMLinkS\\demlinks\\poc\\simpletest\\_test\\simpletest.test.exe:\nAccess is denied.\n\nBut this only happens sometimes, if you don't do step 13, and just keep running `go\ntest` you notice that sometimes it just won't delete the folder and sometimes it deletes\nit.\n\nThat's all I could track so far...\n\nI do remember windows would lock executed files for 60 seconds only when some service\nwasn't running (or was running?) but I've had that once and fixed it then. Point is,\nwindows could be keeping the .exe locked after executing for a few more milisecs let's\nsay, either that or it's something else, I don't know.\u003c/pre\u003e",
