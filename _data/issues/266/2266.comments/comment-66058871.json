But here is another issue if I'm not using Wait() Here is no other way to\ndeterminate when process is exited. So I do not know when to call Wait or close Stdout.\nCan I use cmd. ProcessState? No is it null until you call Run or Wait.\n\nShould I check process still alive using it's PID? I'm afraid using PID can be a\nmistake. Imagine if my child process dies and before I call check process by PID new\nindepended process will spawned with same PID I'm checking. And I will think my child\nstill alive and I get no output from it.\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nI think this case need to be clarified by documentation as well.\u003c/pre\u003e",
