	"body": "by **ryanbressler**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhen using the exec package to run a command like \u0026quot;echo hello\u0026quot; over and over\nagain while reading from the pipe returned by Cmd.StdoutPipe() in separate go routines a\nsmall number of the reads (~1/1000 in my testing) will produce read |0: bad file\ndescriptor errors.\n\nThis does not seem to effect longer running processes (like sleep .1) suggesting that it\nmay have to do with process that finish quickly.  \n\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Compile and run attached code.\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nNo Errors.\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n|0: bad file descriptor for some percent of the reads.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nOS X 10.5.8\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?
