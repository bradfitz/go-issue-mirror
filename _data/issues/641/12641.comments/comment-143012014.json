Well, I have to remember how to create a npf_ext_log kernel module on netbsd, and ah..\n\u003e . where's my npf.conf?\nnpf(7) by default is built as a module and you will find all the modules\nin /stand/${ARCH}/${VERSION}/modules/ (e.g.:\n/stand/amd64/7.99.21/modules ).\n\nThere isn't an npf.conf by default and NPF is neither started by\ndefault. If you need to enable it please create an /etc/npf.conf file\nand add to your /etc/rc.conf file:\n\n    npf=yes\n\nApart the man pages a good documentation regarding NPF is the NPF\ndocumentation written by Mindaugas Rasiukevicius (the author of NPF):\n\n http://netbsd.org/~rmind/npf/\n\nThere are also some examples in /usr/share/examples/npf.\n\nAnyway if you encounter some problems feel free to contact me privately\nvia email and I will share my npf.conf.\n\n\nHTH!\nCiao,\nL.\n",
