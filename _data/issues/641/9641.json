	"body": "What version of Go are you using (go version)?\r\n\r\ngo version go1.3.3 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\nWhat operating system and processor architecture are you using?\r\n\r\nOS X Yosemite\r\n\r\nWhat did you do?\r\n\r\nI'm proxying a long-polling request using:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tremote, err := url.Parse(\"http://localhost:7500\")\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\tpanic(err)\r\n\t}\r\n\tproxy := httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(remote)\r\n\trouter.Handle(\"/endpoint\", proxy)\r\n```\r\nNote that /endpoint is a local address that takes 300 seconds to finish. I mocked this.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nA proxied response.\r\n\r\nWhat did you see instead?\r\n\r\nTimes out if /endpoint takes too long to reply (eg. due to long-polling). The proxy seems to completely drop the response (but oddly enough, only after 300 seconds). Curl'ing the /endpoint on the Go server results in a \"curl: (52) Empty reply from server\", even though data should be written out.",
