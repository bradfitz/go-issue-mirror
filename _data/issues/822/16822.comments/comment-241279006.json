That it would parse relative URLs did not occur to me, but it's even documented.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'm reading this [section 3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3) right:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   In addition, a URI reference\r\n   (Section 4.1) may be a relative-path reference, in which case the\r\n   first path segment cannot contain a colon (\":\") character\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way I read this \"cache_object:\" is the first path segment, and thus violates section 3.3. (without throwing an error in the Go implementation). Apologies if I'm misreading.",
