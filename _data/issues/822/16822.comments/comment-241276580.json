We don't, though: our Parse function is defined (for better or worse) to parse either absolute or relative paths. And if it's not a valid absolute URL, we have no choice but to interpret it as a possible valid relative path.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should add a way to parse in absolute mode only, in which case we could return an error.\r\n\r\nIt still doesn't help you parse \"cache_object\" bogus schemes.\r\n",
