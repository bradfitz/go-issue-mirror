	"body": "by **yusuf.simonson**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI have a Go application that was halting. It turns out I was accidentally manipulating a\nreturn argument rather than a parameter. But it appears to reveal a bug in 6g.\n\nAttached are two files.\n\n1. bug.go - This reproduces the halting bug. I simplified the test case as much as\npossible, but it is still dependent on another project: gozmq\n(github.com/alecthomas/gozmq) which in turn is dependent on zeromq. This will freeze at\nline 4 (\u0026quot;println(response[0])\u0026quot;) rather than crashing.\n\n2. nonbug.go - This is similar to bug.go, but it does not use gozmq. Using this causes\nthe application to crash as expected.\n\nWhile reproduction of the bug necessitates an external dependency, I think this is a\ncompiler bug rather than one with the project, because the issue occurs when referencing\na byte array. Perhaps it has something to do with cgo?\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n  The program should crash, as with nonbug.go.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n  The program halts.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n  6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n  Mac OS X / Snow Leopard\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n  e1e194eb5c8e (release-branch.r57)\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n  There is a bug in gozmq that makes it incapable of building on first pass. I documented it here: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/alecthomas/gozmq/issues/5\"\u003ehttps://github.com/alecthomas/gozmq/issues/5\u003c/a\u003e but the author has not gotten around to it yet. To install it correctly, edit the Makefile, replacing \u0026quot;Users/aat/Homebrew/include\u0026quot; with \u0026quot;/usr/local/include\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;/Users/aat/Homebrew/lib\u0026quot; with \u0026quot;/usr/local/lib\u0026quot;, assuming zeromq is installed in the default locations.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1822/0/bug.go\"\u003ebug.go\u003c/a\u003e (352 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1822/0/nonbug.go\"\u003enonbug.go\u003c/a\u003e (137 bytes)",
