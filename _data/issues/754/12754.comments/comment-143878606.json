Because\nthe method could take multiple arguments and\nreturn multiple arguments, each one is subject to\ninterface conversion! Even if we could devise\na way to get around the problem of generating\nall the wrapper for each interface conversion\n(we need at least two, eface and iface case), for\nN-argument methods, we still need 2^N wrapper\nfunctions.\n",
