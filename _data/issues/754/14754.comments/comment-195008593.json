	"body": "As I look at this, it seems that reverting is the only sane way forward. Calculating the signatures of the functions (as we do now) makes the code more complex with very little benefit, since the original change was attempting to support libraries which use custom printf-style functions, like gRPC's Errorf. If we can't effectively vet imported functions, we can't vet those, and we may as well return to a hardcoded list.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd like to revert, but I want someone with more experience with the ast and vet packages to weigh in to correct me if it's possible to follow imports simply.",
