Whenever a value id gets returned to the allocator, increment the value generation for that value id. Then use \u003cvalue id, value generation\u003e to label the HTML nodes, thereby making the highlighting accurately reflect the actual lifetime of the values. Same for blocks.\r\n\r\nI'm going to re-open this but mark as unplanned, since the only audience for this is internal.",
