'x' is an integer format but\nit's also a string format and the code says: \"If a string is acceptable according to the\nformat, see if the value satisfies [error or Stringer]\".\n\nIf 'x' becomes integer in this context, then I need to think about other non-string\nformats like %g, and I think it just gets more complicated. Also, making the change\ncould possibly break code that wants to hexify the String result, which is reasonable\nitself.\n\nIn short, I will mark this WorkingAsIntended because, although the proposal is\nreasonable, so is the existing behavior. To get the behavior you ask for, it's easy and\narguably clearer to convert:\n\nfmt.Printf(\"decimal: %d; hex %x\\n\", int(d), int(d))\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
