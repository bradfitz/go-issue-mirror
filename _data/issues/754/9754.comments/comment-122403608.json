Looking at the [test code](https://github.com/mozilla-services/heka/blob/dev/sandbox/lua/lua_sandbox_test.go#L806), especially ignored error [here](https://github.com/mozilla-services/heka/blob/dev/sandbox/lua/lua_sandbox_test.go#L838) and [here](https://github.com/mozilla-services/heka/blob/dev/sandbox/lua/lua_sandbox_test.go#L850) seems to confirm the theory. You may want to rewrite the test to not crash, and then eventually figure out the reason why it fails.\r\n\r\n[edit] fixed links",
