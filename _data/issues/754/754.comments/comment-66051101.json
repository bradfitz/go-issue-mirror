The code looks too cryptic for \nme to tell whether the two functions do the same thing or not.\n\nSomebody should add an automated test which makes sure that both of the functions do \nthe same thing, to avoid the implementations from drifting apart. Even better would be \nto implement one of them by calling the other - that would remove the duplicated code.\u003c/pre\u003e",
