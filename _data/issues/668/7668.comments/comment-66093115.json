I am currently not escaping HT, but\nstill letting it escape CR and LF.  It seems the definition of LWS, where it includes\nCRLF, intends for CRLF to mean CR followed by LF not as individual characters.  Does\nthat interpretation seem right?  What is the desired behavior here for CR, LF, and HT?\u003c/pre\u003e",
