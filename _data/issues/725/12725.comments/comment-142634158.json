Our intention was to allow users to use the other golang.org/x/mobile packages (asset, sensors, etc) in gobind apps seamlessly (they are currently designed for native Go apps).\r\n\r\nWe can make it explicit and inform users to call them before using any of the packages. \r\n\r\nOne question I have is if it's right to cache the context in go side, and if so what context we should cache. I guess ApplicationContext would work for asset, sensor, audio once the application context is initialized. For UI components however (creating a webview?) ActivityContext or some other context should be used.\r\n\r\ncc @crawshaw \r\n",
