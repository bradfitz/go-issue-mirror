That's one of the reasons the example app I provided uses a recycler view that places ads at every nth position. Such a case inevitably crashes at some point regardless of how the app bootstraps on start.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that is because the webview code eventually reinits mid scroll? I don't know. But the crash is most definitely caused by the webview google ads uses if I didn't make that clear.",
