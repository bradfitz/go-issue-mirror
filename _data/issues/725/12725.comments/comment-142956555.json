	"body": "@diegomontoya there seem to be a few things going on here and I'd like to pull them apart and address them one at a time.\r\n\r\nThe first is that you say the piece of code above that grabs the global application context is causing your program to crash. I'd like to fix that. Can you give us some more information? For example, the log output?\r\n\r\nThe second is whether or not we need to provide a way for users to pass a context of their own to the native Go packages. If you have a specific need for this, please file another issue. Right now the only things we use that android context for only need the global context, and I would expect a user to plumb through their own android context if they need it. (If I'm reading this bug properly, it sounds like your problem is that you don't need it plumbed through, and our current code doesn't always work.)",
