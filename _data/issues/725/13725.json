	"body": "```\r\n    53\t// GenerateParameters puts a random, valid set of DSA parameters into params.\r\n    54\t// This function takes many seconds, even on fast machines.\r\n    55\tfunc GenerateParameters(params *Parameters, rand io.Reader, sizes ParameterSizes) (err error) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nI find the \"This function takes many seconds\" part confusing because if `sizes`  is chosen to be `dsa.L1024N160` it takes ≤0.5 on my machine (which is not “many seconds” IMHO).\r\n\r\nI had to try out more complex sizes such as `dsa.L3072N256` to make sure there's nothing wrong with my code being that fast (that one took \u003e4s).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how the wording can be fixed here, maybe it's not wrong after all. It might be my English that's wrong, but I think 0.5 seconds is not many seconds.\r\n\r\nIntroduced here: https://github.com/golang/go/blame/220a6de47eced55956eb8af8d643d4f5b67fd634/src/pkg/crypto/dsa/dsa.go#L54 by @agl.",
