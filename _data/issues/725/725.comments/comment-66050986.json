Wouldn't that be the version that takes just a \"float\", not a \"float32\"?\n\nFor better or worse, we've standardized on using float64 as the interface\nto the math library.  If you call cos on float32 so often, you can always\nwrite your own little wrapper in your package\n\nfunc cos(f float32) float32 { return float32(math.Cos(float64(f))) }\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
