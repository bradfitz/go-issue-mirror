In practice, this will make\nthe net/http tests (which never run in parallel) always re-use the same address for all\ntests.  This should cause tests to fail 100% of the time, as seen in failure above that\nmotivated this issue.\n\nThen it'll be easy to verify the fix works, then we can undo the intentional address\nreuse before submitting.\u003c/pre\u003e",
