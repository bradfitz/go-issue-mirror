	"body": "Thank you for adding the meta tags on launchpad.net itself. Removing a special case sounds great. Note that people using Go 1.4 and earlier will still not be able to take advantage of the tags, because the name pattern will trigger. That is, I believe we have to remove the special case code in order for the tags to do anything useful for you (in particular, for them to resolve the problem that some repos are now git). So once the tags are deployed let us know and we'll gladly rip the special case out (or just send a CL).\r\n\r\nThanks.",
