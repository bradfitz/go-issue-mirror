Largest hit due to http://golang.org/cl/20968. @rlh is trying to use VTune to pin down the slow code.\r\n- Revcomp: ~30% performance hit on 386 only. Entirely due to http://golang.org/cl/20901. @dr2chase is looking at this.\r\n- GobDecode: ~10% performance hit on arm32, arm64, and 386. Very noisy, no obvious culprit.\r\n- JsonDecode: ~30% performance hit on arm32, arm64, ~15% on 386. Less noisy, still no obvious culprit.\r\n- Gzip: ~20% performance hit on arm32, arm64. Still need to bisect (not as easy as bisecting on 386).",
