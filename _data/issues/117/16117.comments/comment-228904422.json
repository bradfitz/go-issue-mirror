Sure adding a global cache will help, but a struct field access will still be faster even for SSA.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with the runtime, but I'm thinking something like whether using the compact form for compiled binary but a pre-unmarshalled form for runtime reflection is doable in a later release.",
