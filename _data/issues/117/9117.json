	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCurrently go/loader looks for packages relative to $GOPATH and $GOROOT but it should\nalso allow paths relative to the current directory such as ./foo, and do so in a manner\nconsistent with the 'go' tool.\n\nThis is a subtle change because the name supplied by the user (./foo) may not match the\ncanonical import path (\u0026quot;bar/foo\u0026quot;) that is widely used as a map key, so we'll\nneed to audit and test the code thoroughly.\n\nDo this after the 1.4 tree thaw.\u003c/pre\u003e",
