	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eFiling this as follow up to\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/125250043/\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/125250043/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe CL replaced word-based type info caching in scanblock with byte-based caching. This\npotentially makes it less efficient.\n\nWe have 3 options:\n1. Leave the cache as is.\n2. Remove the cache at all.\n3. Restore word-based caching.\n\nWord-based caching will require more tricky extraction of quadruples from words. First\nit will be different on little-endian and big-endian machines. Second, extraction on\nlittle-endian machines will require something like shift=(ncached^1)*gcBits.\n\nThe choice requires additional benchmarking.\u003c/pre\u003e",
