	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eSuggestion is to make %#v output type information when formatting simple types, e.g. var\nf float64 = 1 would be formatted as \u0026quot;float64(1)\u0026quot; rather than \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; as\nit is now.\n\nThis gets complicated when looking into composite types; presumably under this approach\nthe type annotation for array/slice/map elements/keys should be elided to match the\nelision rules for valid Go syntax, but composite fields should still have their type\nshown.\n\nThere are obvious potential compatibility issues with change.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/0uloMvaQBYY/discussion\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/0uloMvaQBYY/discussion\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
