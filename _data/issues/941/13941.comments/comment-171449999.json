It may cause it to be able to decode something that the C version otherwise would not be able to, but should not cause the Go implementation to fail on decoding something that the C version can.\r\n\r\nIs this causing a problem for you?\r\n\r\nThe wrong block-size is not the only inconsistency between the Go version and the \"canonical\" C implementation.",
