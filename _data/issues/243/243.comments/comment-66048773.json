But we shouldn't be\ntalking about what Linux does because this is about a *language* feature, and\nlanguages should not be dependent on a specific operating system, and certainly not a\n\"default setup\" for that operating system (I myself have, on occasion, changed that\nsetting).\n\nAs for the point about needing memory to handle out-of-memory conditions, serious\nsystems programmers have been known to handle such things by taking care to static\nallocate whatever is needed to handle the error. Again, at the language level one\nshould not make assumptions as to what the users of the language will do in such\ncircumstances.\n\nAs for registering an observer with the heap/gc subsystem, that's the sort of hook I\nreferred to, which would be fix number 5. It does however mean a global response to\nwhat may be a local logic error or excessive allocation.\u003c/pre\u003e",
