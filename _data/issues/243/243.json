	"body": "by **JQBalter**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe language specification doesn't say what happens if new() fails to allocate\nmemory. Here are three ways to fix this:\n\n1) Make new() return nil upon failure. This will introduce a bug into every current\ncall of new() (except those that checked new() for nil for no documented reason).\nIt also requires a coding style that is verbose and known to be error-prone. And it\nwouldn't work well if nonnullable pointer types were ever added to the language.\n\n2) Make new() return res, ok. Calls that don't check the second return value could\nresult in a fatal error if new() fails. This avoids introducing a bug into every current\ncall, but turns local failures into global ones -- not a good design for systems\nprogramming or servers. This approach also requires a verbose coding style in \ncode that checks for allocation failure (which rarely happens, discouraging\nprogrammers from checking).\n\n3) Introduce exceptions into the language and issue an exception if new() fails.\u003c/pre\u003e",
