	"body": "The `testing` package's [`T.Parallel`](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#T.Parallel) method resets the time of the test so  that it's as if the test starts just before the method returns. The reason for doing this is that it's likely the first call made from the testing function. This is reasonable, but I suggest that this behavior be documented. The source is [here](https://golang.org/src/testing/testing.go?s=14868:14890#L410).",
