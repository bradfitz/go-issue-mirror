It's not\nan ideal solution, but it works.\nBasically, I just manually replace all the invalid characters in the set-cookie header\nof the response and then store them in a jar. And for requests, when the cookies are\nloaded I just replace the placeholder characters with the \"bad\" ones directly in the\ncookie header.\nIt's obviously not perfect, since you can't have all characters in the cookie, that\nwould otherwise be supported.\n\nP.S. In fact, the Android http client doesn't reject these malformed cookies. They\nintegrate flawlessly.\u003c/pre\u003e",
