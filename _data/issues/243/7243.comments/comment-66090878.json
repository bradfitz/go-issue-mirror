Servers should\nadhere to stricter requirements; User Agents have to play nice with looser,\nnon-compliant servers.\n\nSection 5.2. \"The Set-Cookie Header\" says that \"The algorithm below is more permissive\nthan the grammar in Section 4.1 (Syntax)\", and implicitly allows commas (or really, any\nbytes up to the first ';' or end-of-line, I think).\n\nI think that when generating a Set-Cookie header and consuming a Cookie header, Go's\nnet/http library should use the stricter rules. When consuming a Set-Cookie header and\ngenerating a Cookie header, we should use the looser rules.\u003c/pre\u003e",
