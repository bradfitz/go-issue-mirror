In particular, you can do the operation by simply changing your command to invoke the taskset program.  So that change should not be made.\r\n\r\nAs noted previously, the SetAffinity, etc., functions should not be added to the syscall package, because that package is frozen.  They should be added to golang.org/x/sys/unix.",
