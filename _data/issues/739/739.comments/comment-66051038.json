As a consequence,\nredeclaration can only appear in a multi-variable short declaration. Redeclaration\ndoes not introduce a new variable; it just assigns a new value to the original.\"\n\nIn your Comment 1 example, the short variable declaration `n := 4` can't redeclare\nthe function result variable `n int`; `n int`, the original declaration, is not in\nthe same block. Also, `n := 4` isn't a multi-variable short declaration. Therefore,\n`n := 4` declares a new inner variable, shadowing and hiding the outer variable `n int`.\u003c/pre\u003e",
