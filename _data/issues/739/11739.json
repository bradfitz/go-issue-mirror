	"body": "I don't have a minimal example, but https://launchpadlibrarian.net/211688868/buildlog_ubuntu-wily-arm64.account-polld_0.1%2B15.04.20150410-0ubuntu2~gcc5.1_BUILDING.txt.gz is an example of this happening. http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-push-hackers/account-polld/trunk/view/head:/accounts/accounts.go#L20 is \"#cgo pkg-config: glib-2.0 libaccounts-glib libsignon-glib\" but the flags are not being passed in the link.\r\n\r\nI don't entirely get how this is supposed to work. cgo writes the flags to a file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat $WORK/launchpad.net/account-polld/accounts/_obj/_cgo_flags\r\n_CGO_LDFLAGS=-g -O2 -laccounts-glib -lsignon-glib -lgio-2.0 -lgobject-2.0 -lglib-2.0\r\n_CGO_CFLAGS=-pthread -I/usr/include/signond -I/usr/include/gio-unix-2.0/ -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/glib-2.0/include -I /tmp/go-build086811367/launchpad.net/account-polld/accounts/_obj/\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut afaict nothing ever looks at this file. When *gccgo is false (https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/cgo/out.go#L42) it also writes out //go:cgo_ldflag comments, which is how this works with the usual compiler but gccgo doesn't use those comments I think.",
