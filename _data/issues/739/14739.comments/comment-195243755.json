As you say, we can build ourselves.\r\n\r\nI am saying that nominating a specific signing key *once* (every 12-24 months) to explicitly trust is completely different to trusting that hundreds of standard CAs plus arbitrary ones unique to each system and whatever intermidiate CAs in between, will enable TLS to really do its job on *every single connection*.\r\n\r\nI only wish to counter the perception here that GPG signatures bring zero benefit. It may be negligible benefit (depending on where you sit), but it isn't zero.",
