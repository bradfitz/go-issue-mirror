	"body": "Speaking of trusting arbitrary CAs, I've encountered an environment that added the in-house/private root CA to the CA bundles on their build boxes in order to deal with various self-hosted internal services running over TLS. Gaining control of the local CA certainly would've been a lot easier than compromising an actual CA.\r\n\r\nGPG keys let build maintainers (rather than whatever is in the ca cert bundle this week) have a say in the provenance of their sources. Sure, you've got bigger problems than wonky build farms if someone is rummaging around on your network with a level of access that could exploit the above scenario, but the point is that CA infrastructure is a very different animal to specific, hand-curated GPG trust relationships. And, yes: builds break when signing keys change. For some, this is an important signal, and a feature.\r\n\r\nHaving helped administer an open source project that offered them, I can confirm that the number of people that access checksums (let alone signatures) is a tiny fraction of 1% of downloads. For many projects, it's perfectly justifiable not to offer GPG sigs. Just, let's not pretend that https is equivalent.",
