	"body": "Almost: `curl --pinnedpubkey` is apparently a thing now, but it's new enough that most distros aren't shipping it yet. `curl --cacert` and `wget --ca-certificate` aren't quite the same, but probably close enough in practice. We could also use `openssl` to extract and verify the signature shasum, but this isn't as clean because once again, it makes no guarantees for the *next* TLS connection over which we presumably fetch something.\r\n\r\nTraditionally though, it's considered best practice to sign an artefact where possible, not just the connection it arrives on (hence why most software distribution channels continue to bother signing things rather than just trusting TLS).\r\n\r\nApologies for generating issue tracker noise, this is admittedly a very minor nit-pick, I do appreciate all the great work done here.",
