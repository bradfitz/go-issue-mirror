Even if we did sign our binaries with GPG, you'd then be concerned and filing more bugs asking whether our public key is really our public key and its heritage and how you know it's ours. I promise Google's network and CA infrastructure is leaps and bounds tighter than anybody on the Go team alone would be able to do. The Go team isn't going to manage our own keys. If we did, it might make you happy for a bit, but it wouldn't be more secure.",
