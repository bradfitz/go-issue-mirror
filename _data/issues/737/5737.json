The only thing we\ncan think of is specifying a filename in the custom \u0026quot;dataSourceName\u0026quot; string\nformat. But this gets rather complicated when you want to customize things like the\nRootCA. If you want to provide an embedded certificate, you really can't.\n\nWe really need something like this:\n\nOpenMore(driverName string, settings map[string]interface{}) (*DB, error)\n\nSo you could do something like this:\n\nOpenMore(\u0026quot;mysql\u0026quot;, Settings{..., \u0026quot;tls\u0026quot;: \u0026amp;tls.Config{...}}\u003c/pre\u003e",
