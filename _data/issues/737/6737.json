Use gob.Encode on an instance of that struct.\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/_LyE3lvhpC\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/_LyE3lvhpC\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nA successful encoding of the struct.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nAn error complaining about the inability to encode a function.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n1.1.2\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI feel like checking fields for the GobEncode/Decode methods should be the default\nbehavior.\nOtherwise, anyone who wants to use a type that requires the use of GobEncode/GobDecode\nhas to implement those methods in whatever struct contains it, just so it can call\nGobEncode on the field, and copy the other fields verbatim. And then anyone who then\nwants to include that struct as a field has to do so as well, and so on.\u003c/pre\u003e",
