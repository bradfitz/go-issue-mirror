It seems that we are in trouble if anybody calls File on a socket\nand then calls AcceptTCP or AcceptUnix on it.\n\nOr maybe the code in netFD.dup is wrong.  The comment implies that it is possible to set\nblocking mode only for the new fd, but it is not.  Setting blocking mode for the new fd\nalso sets it for the old one.  This makes me wonder why netFD.dup calls dup at all.\u003c/pre\u003e",
