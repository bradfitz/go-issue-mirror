If the connection is being closed while the client is reading/writing.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case above (using 1.6 beta1), it stopped appearing when extending the Read and Write deadlines on the server in `ConnState` `http.StateActive` as seen here https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13925#issuecomment-171027178\r\n\r\nNow using latest using latest code in the master branch (771da53958618108c8ea56a69412eaeaae79e0ae) it is still appearing even with the change above.\r\n\r\nIn this case it was when the server got Killed by the system (memory pressure). Probably the same thing again, the client expected the connection to be open and was reading/writing to it.\r\n\r\nI had 3 programs running on 3 different machines with several clients running in goroutines, and they all got the same panic at the same time with exactly the same stack trace as above (although different line numbers now):\r\n\r\n```\r\npanic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference\r\n[signal 0xb code=0x1 addr=0x20 pc=0x57aacc]\r\n\r\ngoroutine 1084538 [running]:\r\nnet/http.(*persistConn).closeLocked(0xc822551450, 0x7f95b1e55028, 0xc820010dd0)\r\n\t/usr/local/go/src/net/http/transport.go:1505 +0xac\r\nnet/http.(*persistConn).close(0xc822551450, 0x7f95b1e55028, 0xc820010dd0)\r\n\t/usr/local/go/src/net/http/transport.go:1496 +0x92\r\nnet/http.(*Transport).putOrCloseIdleConn(0xc8200ae2c0, 0xc822551450)\r\n\t/usr/local/go/src/net/http/transport.go:478 +0x5d\r\nnet/http.(*Transport).getConn.func2.1(0xc8214d3860, 0xc8200ae2c0, 0x98ec88)\r\n\t/usr/local/go/src/net/http/transport.go:656 +0x7f\r\ncreated by net/http.(*Transport).getConn.func2\r\n\t/usr/local/go/src/net/http/transport.go:659 +0x70\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am now using a `Transport.Dial` hook which is wrapping and returning the values of `net.DialTimeout(network, addr, ioTimeout)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
