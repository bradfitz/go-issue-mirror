	"body": "@adg @bradfitz \r\n\r\nFor discussion, because this is based only my usage patterns.\r\n\r\nHash is useful to go to commit page. However, I first need to look at the very right to find the commit, and then visually move to the very left to click on the commit. With the current number of builders this movement is very painful.\r\n\r\nAlso, the exact characters of the commit hash does not seem to be super important to occupy the first column.\r\n\r\nSo I propose to linkify commit message to link to the commit page.\r\n\r\nIf one needs to copy commit hash, then it is possible to do on the commit page. If one strongly wants to be able to copy commit hash right on the dashboard, then I still propose to move it to right, e.g.:\r\nruntime: cache workbufs on Ms and add consistency checks (a15818fed303)\r\nBecause one needs to see commit description to pick the right hash.\r\n\r\n",
