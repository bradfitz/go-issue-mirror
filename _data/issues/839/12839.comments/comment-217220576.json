	"body": "I just noticed this bug in my own code's doc as well.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, why is a function that is not a method assigned to any type at all?  i.e., why is it indented under a type in the generated \"Index\" section of the doc?  I've often found this confusing when looking at, for example, the \"time\" docs. I guess I see the idea behind it (to group potentially-related functions together?) but it's counter-intuitive insofar as the function doesn't really \"belong\" to that type so when I go looking for time.Parse I ddidn't expect to have to look under the time.Time section.\r\n\r\nAnd of course it has the drawback expressed by this bug, where choosing one of several types or moving it to top-level will be inconsistent.",
