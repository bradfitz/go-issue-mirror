Other languages have encountered and\ntackled this problem successfully in Windows. As one example, the report of the same\nissue in Python led to a detailed discussion and ultimately had a successful resolution\n(\u003ca href=\"http://bugs.python.org/issue8828)\"\u003ehttp://bugs.python.org/issue8828)\u003c/a\u003e. The resolution of this bug in other Go projects\nfollows the same pattern - effectively creating an os.Replace() function for this\ncircumstance, using the Windows MoveFileEx api. Whether os.Rename() is enhanced to\nproperly handle Windows cases or a new os.Replace() function is created that satisfies\nthe same criteria, it would prevent everyone from re-inventing the same wheel virtually\nthe same way simply to sidestep this bug.\u003c/pre\u003e",
