	"body": "I worry about making this the default. As @dominikh said, it's incredibly frustrating to have insufficient debugging info because you forgot to turn on some option. I also worry that it will reduce the quality of bug reports, both by Go developers to Go and, especially, by end users to software written in Go.\r\n\r\nI worry less about adding it as an option, but we have to ask if this is for experienced Go users or inexperienced ones? If it's for inexperienced ones, then it cannot be a non-default option because they won't find it. However, I think it's actually less important for inexperienced users because they tend not to have many goroutines. If it's for experienced ones, they can discover the option and weigh the costs and benefits of using it.\r\n\r\nHere's an alternate proposal, though I'm not sure whether or not I like it. At the end of the traceback spew, re-print just the panic message and the file/line that it happened on (*not* the full traceback). If most of the time during development only the current goroutine matters, I posit that most of the time that only the current goroutine matters, only the line that failed matters. And if it turns out you need more than that, it's all there above.",
