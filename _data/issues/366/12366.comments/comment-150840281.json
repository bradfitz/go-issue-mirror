	"body": "I have a feeling that changing the default to only showing one goroutine would benefit trivial errors only, and punish complex ones. One can argue that in a similar vein, this change would benefit newer Go programmers but punish more experienced ones.\r\n\r\nOne needs to keep in mind that crashes can happen unexpectedly and may be hard to reproduce, and little is more annoying than having insufficient debugging output when such a crash happens. Having to set an environment variable – that didn't need to be set for years – and wait for the crash to happen again is a terrible experience.",
