The \"Advanced Micro Devices Software Optimization Guide\" also has a lot of advice on the topic of rep mov.\r\n\r\nthe intel manual also says about enhanced rep movsb:\r\n```\r\nMemcpy_ERMSB/Memcpy_AVX128\r\n\u003c128 | 128 to 2048 | 2048 to 4096\r\n0x7X | 1X | 1.02X\r\n\r\nTable 3-4 shows the relative performance of the Memcpy function implemented using enhanced \r\nREP MOVSB versus 128-bit AVX for several ranges of memcpy lengths, when both the source and\r\ndestination addresses are 16-byte aligned and the source region and destination region \r\ndo not overlap. For memcpy length less than 128 bytes, using ERMSB is slower than \r\nwhatâ€™s possible using 128-bit AVX, due to internal start-up overhead in the REP string.\r\n```",
