For example, I want to get the GET values and the raw POST body (it's not\nURL encoded). By using request.FormValue the post BODY is read - which can only be read\nonce. Because of this I have to ignore the entire API and parse GET values myself so the\nPOST body isn't read and cleared before I have a chance to read it.\n\nI would prefer the POST body not was read unless explicitly intended. This could be made\nmore clear by having:\n\nrequest.GetValue\nrequest.PostValue\n\nThe request.FormValue can work as is (reads either/or) but when a key conflicts between\nGET and POST the POST should take precedence over GET.\u003c/pre\u003e",
