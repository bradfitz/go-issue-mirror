This is the part I was missing:\n\"This particular example works because the form posts to the same page\n(no action value in \u0026lt;form\u0026gt;), so the query string is retained.\"\n\nI agree that POST values should take precedence. I would also be happy\nto have a r.PostForm field like r.Form but containing only the posted\nvalues.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **go1.1**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
