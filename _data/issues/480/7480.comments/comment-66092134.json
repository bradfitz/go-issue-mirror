If you save nfinal into a temporary and use that in the\nprint, the failure is always \"not enough finalizing: 0 / 250\" which means the finalizers\nare not being run in time. I'm not sure why that is yet.\n\nThis failure seems to happen pretty frequently. I've run the test a lot and in some\niterations, it happens 1 out of every 5 times and others it's 1 in 20.\n\nStill investigating ...\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
