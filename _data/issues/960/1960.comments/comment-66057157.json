The fix you linked to is not present in\nthe source linked to on the main site (here: \u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/)\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/)\u003c/a\u003e\nbut it is in the hg pull. I was using the linked src as a starting point for an\nalternate reverse proxy. I didn't realize they were different. Sorry to waste your time\non this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
