I don't truly understand what's your suggestion but gomobile requires 1.5 to be built and run. So, it can't tell anything to the user if user doesn't have 1.5 already.\r\n\r\n\u003e Or gomobile could download and build tip by its own if the current Go version is not sufficient\r\n\r\nIt would require us shipping binaries for each host platform. Much work and it will be useless once 1.5 is released.",
