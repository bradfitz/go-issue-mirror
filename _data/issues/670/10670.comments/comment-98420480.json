We can do some arrangements but I am not sure it's worthy to follow this path.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, for cross compilation we need the Go source at the gomobile init stage. For a newcomer, it is too much work to checkout the source (note that some distributions don't distribute the source), get the gomobile command and run gomobile init. Should init do it all for itself? Maybe.\r\n\r\ncc/ @crawshaw ",
