If the std library tests are\nfailing, there isn't much point in continuing further. And the platform\nmaintainer should fix the test asap. (Even if the builders do continue\nafter the first failure, i don't think it will prevent bitrot as people\nwill see that the builder has always been failing and just won't bother to\nsee if there is any new failures caused by their commit.)\n\nI also remember there are rejected proposal to make the builder use -k.\n",
