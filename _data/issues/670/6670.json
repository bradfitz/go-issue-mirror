(Not for Go 1.2, I know.) I'd happily put in the\neffort to implement this, but I'd like to discuss first, to ensure that I take a good\napproach and to check that there's nothing else planned that makes this moot.\n\nThe obvious question is around the \u0026quot;check periodically\u0026quot; part. Options include,\ne.g.:\n\n* Use fsnotify (extracted from or after #4068)\n* Stat every n seconds\n* Stat every n requests\n* Stat after n DNS failures\n* Stat on first request after n seconds have elapsed since last stat\n\nInput on this?\n\nAnything else I should be asking here?\u003c/pre\u003e",
