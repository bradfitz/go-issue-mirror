	"body": "The implements query inspects only the query package and its forward transitive closure, but users expect (and the documentation states) that it will report all related types in the analysis scope.  Thus a query at bufio.Reader will report io.Reader, but a query at io.Reader will not report *bufio.Reader.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly likely a regression due to commit b28839e4 in March.\r\n\r\nThe implements query should load all necessary packages in the analysis scope.  It may be profitable to skip type-checking of all function bodies that do not contain a type declaration.",
