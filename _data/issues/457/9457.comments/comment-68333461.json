	"body": "Thank you for DLL. Unfortunately I don't see anything new. Your DLL raises 0xC00000FD EXCEPTION_STACK_OVERFLOW. I don't know why - I don't understand your C++ code. Maybe it needs more stack space. Go is using 64K for its threads stack. Maybe that is not enough.\r\n\r\nYou can try and change your program so that it uses cgo. Programs built with cgo reserve more stack space: 1M for 386 and 2M for amd64. Just to see if that solves your problem.\r\n\r\nI don't see how we can help you here. So closing this issue. Feel free to comment.\r\n\r\nAlex",
