	"body": "I have a similar case - the \u003cmeta\u003e tag includes a RepoRoot starting with ssh://git@git.corp.company.com path, and trying to do `go get` with 1.5 produces an error:\r\n```\r\npackage go.corp.company.com/org/repo/...: cannot download, ssh://git@git.corp.company.com/org/repo uses insecure protocol\r\n```\r\nWe could work around with `-insecure` flag to `go get` but I would really hate to train our developers to pass such options on a regular basis.  The error seems wrong since ssh://git is a secure protocol.\r\n\r\nShould we change the server sending the meta tags to send `git+ssh://git@git.corp.company.com` instead of the current `ssh://git@git.corp.company.com`?  Would it solve the problem?",
