Right now, we use constant pool entry\nfor absolute address, to support PIE (or PIC), we have to use PC\nrelative load.\n\nMOVW addr(SB), R0 is currently translated to:\n    ldr r11, [pc, #cpoff]; constant pool uses R_ADDR reloc.\n    ldr r0, [r11]\n\nTo switch to PIC, it needs to be translated to:\n    ldr r11, [pc, #cpoff]; constant pool uses R_PCREL+addend\n    ldr r0, [pc, r11]\n\n\nMOVW $addr(SB), R1 is currently translated to:\n    ldr r1, [pc, #cpoff]\nTo switch to PIC, it needs to be:\n    ldr r11, [pc, #cpoff]\n    add r11, pc, r1\n",
