While in this case it might make sense to reduce it to 0, sometimes an author puts in parentheses deliberately to emphasize nesting. gofmt cannot reasonably make that style decision.\r\n\r\nFor instance, `(((x + y)))` is simplified to `(x + y)`, but `z := (x + y)` is not further simplified. There's no difference between parentheses around expressions and parentheses around types.\r\n\r\nCode like this is extremely uncommon (unless machine-generated perhaps, but then it's also easy to fix on the generator side); and this is the first such complaint in years.
