Alias analysis is likely to break any code that does anything other than an immediate read using the converted pointer.\r\n\r\nIn gccgo I disable alias analysis in any file that imports unsafe.  Russ and I discussed that several years ago--that importing unsafe should disable some optimizations within the file but should not affect other files, thus giving people who import unsafe yet another way to break things--but I don't think we ever wrote it down.",
