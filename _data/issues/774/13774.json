	"body": "Currently if the http2.Transport hits MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS for a host, it just makes a new TCP connection and creates the stream on the new connection instead.\r\n\r\nWe should probably just block the application and chill out for a bit, waiting for the host to be happy again.\r\n\r\nWe're probably respecting the letter of the spec more than the spirit of the spec.\r\n\r\n/cc @bmizerany\r\n",
