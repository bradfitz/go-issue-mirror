	"body": "This is an issue regarding `golang.org/x/exp`. Hopefully this is the right place to report, since https://github.com/golang/exp does not accept issues or PRs. If not, let me know.\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (go version)?\r\nThis problem is independent of go version.\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using?\r\nThis problem occurs on all non-linux operating systems. \r\nTested on `go1.5.1 darwin/amd64`\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go get golang.org/x/exp/inotify\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nExpected `go get` not to error.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go get golang.org/x/exp/inotify\r\ngolang.org/x/exp/inotify: no buildable Go source files in /Users/karl/go/src/golang.org/x/exp/inotify\r\n$ echo $?\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### More Context\r\nOne example of the failure behavior is to try to build [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) on a Mac. The Godep restore fails to checkout the required dependencies, because Godep uses `go get`.\r\n\r\nThis isn't normally a problem if your application is linux-only, because developers expect to only build it on linux, but if you optionally use this package (OS detection or command detection) this means go getting your project will now fail on non-linux OSs. \r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\nOne fix would be to add another file to the package that builds on non-linux OSs. Either a `doc.go` for package docs or an `inotify_other.go` would work. This file would just include the package def. This way compilation would still fail, if you required the linux-only types from a non-linux go file, but `go get` would succeed.",
