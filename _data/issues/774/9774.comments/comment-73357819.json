It may be appropriate if the benchmark is failing episodically.\r\nWe run all benchmarks on race builders to get at least some concurrent coverage, and these look like useful benchmarks for that.\r\nAlso I run all benchmarks to measure difference in allocs/run. The benchmarks also look useful for that.\r\n\r\nYou can filter these benchmarks with -bench flag or just grep -v afterwards.\r\n",
