To clean up I started to put things in folders and suddenly `go run` was no longer an option.\r\n\r\nIf this is not to be supported then at least expectations and error messages should be adjusted.\r\nThen `go run` should only allow files in the local dir and have that documented.\r\n\r\nEither it should be done right or made clear it's no option. I don't really see a middle ground here.",
