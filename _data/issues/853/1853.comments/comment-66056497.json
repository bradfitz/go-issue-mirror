Being able to run arbitrary shell commands\nthrows that out the window.  It's not an option.\n\nGoinstall also works to keep the makefiles it generates from being\nable to run arbitrary shell code.  If they can do that, please create an issue.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
