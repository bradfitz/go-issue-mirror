[arguments...]\r\n\r\nI would have thought that it would be OK to run `go` files like\r\n\r\n    go run main.go folder/*.go\r\n\r\nbut for reasons I don't understand it tries to find the file `folder/main.go` instead (and obviously fails). All files are in the `main` package.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to allow arbitrary paths to the `go` files.\r\nIf that's out of question at least the docs and error message should be improved.\r\n\r\nhttp://golang.org/doc/code.html\r\nhttps://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_and_run_Go_program",
