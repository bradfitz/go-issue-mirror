In this case, instruct the linker\nnot to spend time and disk space generating the debug information\nby passing the -w flag to the linker.\n\nOmitting dwarf information reduces the size of most binaries by 25%.\nWe may be more aggressive about this in the future.\n\nLGTM=bradfitz, r\nR=r, bradfitz\nCC=golang-codereviews\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/65890043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/65890043\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
