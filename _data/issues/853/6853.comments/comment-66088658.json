Assuming this is the same case for which Rob's\nnumbers are reported, by this metric Go 1.3 will roll back more than half the size\nincrease caused by Go 1.2 (relative to Go 1.1). Will leave further improvement for Go\n1.4.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.4**, removed **release-go1.3**._",
