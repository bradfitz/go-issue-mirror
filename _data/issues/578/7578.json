	"body": "by **majid@apsalar.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI built gccgo from the official gcc4.8.2 source tarball. It builds and installs fine,\nbut won't compile executables, failing at the link step. Here is the output from the\nhello, world program:\n\nstar64 ~/build\u0026gt;gccgo -o hello fazal/hello.go\nUndefined                       first referenced\n symbol                             in file\nruntime_raceacquireg               \n/usr/local/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-solaris2.11/4.8.2/../../../amd64/libgo.so\nruntime_racereleaseg               \n/usr/local/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-solaris2.11/4.8.2/../../../amd64/libgo.so\nruntime_raceacquire                \n/usr/local/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-solaris2.11/4.8.2/../../../amd64/libgo.so\nruntime_racerelease                \n/usr/local/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-solaris2.11/4.8.2/../../../amd64/libgo.so\nld: fatal: symbol referencing errors. No output written to hello\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nI searched the code base for definitions of runtime_raceacquire and they are not there\n(nor are they in the gofrontend mercurial repository's libgo, or in the SVN version of\ngccgo). The functions seem to be defined in race.c from the mainline go project, but\nthat is not included with GCC or gofrontend.\u003c/pre\u003e",
