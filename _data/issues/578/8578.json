Specifically:\n\n\u0026quot;The blank identifier may be used like any other identifier in a declaration, but\nit does not introduce a binding and thus is not declared.\u0026quot;\n\nThis is *very* confusing. I believe it would be simpler and more understandable if\ncompilers were required to outright reject (with an error messages) attempt to define\nmethods named \u0026quot;_\u0026quot; rather than have them mysteriously not work.\u003c/pre\u003e",
