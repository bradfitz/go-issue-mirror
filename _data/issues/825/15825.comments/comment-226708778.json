In my test case that would mean I got the \"download\" and \"compile\" steps done, but not the \"install\" step? How could I create this situation? (I probably only used \"go get\" maybe some \"go installs\" and later go build on my local source code. The local source finds the go-sqlite3 pacages and uses it, so it must be compiled at the right place I think.)",
