The pre-send goroutine blocks in the channel send. \nWhen the channel is closed, the send is unblocked and executed.  It then panics becaues\na send on a closed channel panics.\n\nA send on a synchronous channel blocks until something can happen.  Closing the channel\nmeans that something can happen: namely, the send can panic.  This is in the spec under\n\"Close\".  I agree that it would be worth adding a clause under \"Send statement.\"\u003c/pre\u003e",
