The anonymous field SousClasse.SuperClasse\nis a pointer type, where the zero value becomes a nil pointer. \n\nfmt.Printf(\"hello, world %s \\n\", p.nom) tries to find nom via p (a pointer) and then\nthrough p.SuperClasse (a pointer). Since p.SuperClasse is nil, the program fails with\na runtime error, due to an invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference.\n\nThe problem is that you never set cl.SuperClasse to point to anything, so its value\nis a nil pointer. Do something like this to point cl.SuperClasse to something,\n\ncl := SousClasse{}\ncl.SuperClasse = new(SuperClasse)\u003c/pre\u003e",
