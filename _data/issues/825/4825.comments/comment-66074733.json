I am parsing\na Comtrade binary data file. \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comtrade\"\u003ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comtrade\u003c/a\u003e and the linkt to the\nstandard\n\u003ca href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=\u0026arnumber=798772\u0026isnumber=17337\"\u003ehttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=\u0026arnumber=798772\u0026isnumber=17337\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe number of Analogs and Digitals is specified in the Config file. And I really dont\nhave control of how they do the encoding, I cannot force them to encode using gob or\njson, I wish I could.\n\nI really have a work around and everything works. It just was frustrating that the\nruntime errors were not really helpful.\n\nSince I do pass in a slice of structs with arrays and it works, but a slice of structs\nwith slices does not work, which is indeed working as designed.\n\nI have a fixed size struct, but its size is not known as a constant expression. This is\nthe root problem.\n\nThanks for all your work and really elegant APIs, I like them and I am enjoying\nprogramming in Go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
