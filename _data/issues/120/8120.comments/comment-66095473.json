Using the\nlatest version of 'go vet':\n\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/code.google.com/p/gogoprotobuf/proto\n$ go vet -unsafeptr .\npointer_unsafe_gogo.go:55: possible misuse of unsafe.Pointer\npointer_unsafe_gogo.go:56: possible misuse of unsafe.Pointer\n\nThis is born out in the panic stack trace -- it's panicking due to a bad reflect.String\npointer. The reflect.String was constructed using unsafe during message parsing.\n\nSee \u003ca href=\"http://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.3#garbage_collector\"\u003ehttp://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.3#garbage_collector\u003c/a\u003e for more details.\n\nIncidentally, I tried testing with '-tags appengine' to confirm this diagnosis, but that\nyields a bunch of compilation errors. When you report the unsafe.Pointer issues upstream\nto gogoprotobuf, you might want to report that as well.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
