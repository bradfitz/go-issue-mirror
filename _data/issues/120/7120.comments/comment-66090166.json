In particular it says on\npage 19:\n\n    It should be noted that the above algorithm makes provision for\n    languages other than C and C++ in that it provides for passing\n    arrays by value and for passing arguments of dynamic size.\n\nAnd the rules for where each argument should go on the page before only mention\n\"composite types\", a category of type that includes both structs and arrays.  So I think\nthis is a bug in the gcc middle end really and off to gcc bugzilla I go again.  Changing\nthis for 4.8 doesn't feel like a great idea though, so I'll play with tricking libffi as\nwell.\u003c/pre\u003e",
