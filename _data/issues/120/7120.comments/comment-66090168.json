I think we need\nto mangle the parameters array so that aparams[0] is a pointer to a pointer to the\narray, not just a pointer to the array?  Or convince libffi that aparams[0] is the\nargument that should be passed, not a pointer to the argument, but I can't see how to do\nthat.  Does this seem right?\u003c/pre\u003e",
