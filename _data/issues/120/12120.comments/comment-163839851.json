	"body": "\u003e I don't see how your suggestion to create a \"separate test helper package\" would help. Regardless of whether the code lives in my current `models` package or a new `models_test_helper` package, code will only be visible to other packages if exported from `.go` files instead of `_test.go` files.\r\n\r\nAs I understand the suggestion, the whole point of `models_test_helper` is that it would be a package completely dedicated to providing common functionality **for tests**. It would have no other stuff, except what's needed for tests. Everything in it would be in normal `.go` files. You could put that package under `internal` to make sure no one else tries to use it.",
