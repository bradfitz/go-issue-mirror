	"body": "Thanks for 'splaining!  I read the proposal on `internal`...that still doesn't help, as I need a solution that includes the code during test, but excludes it on normal builds.\r\n\r\nTo provide a bit more context, the application I'm working on runs in industrial gateways (specialized wifi routers that also have cellular data capabilities).  Some of these devices have as little as 64MB of free RAM and ~80MB flash when we install our binary. Hence we can't afford to bloat the binary with a bunch of dead test code/data.\r\n\r\nI'm happy enough with the workaround I described above...just wanted to chime in with another use case for a `test` build tag.",
