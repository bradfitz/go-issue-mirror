(Note that we don't\ncache compiled test packages.) What's even more dangerous is\nthat this feature could be used to change the behavior of a package\ndepending on whether it's used in a test of other package or not,\nwhich might lead to bugs very hard to track down (a bug that only\nhappens in tests, or worse, that only happens when the package\nis not used not in tests.)\n\nThe way to handle your case is to have separate test helper package\nfor package models.\n",
