	"body": "We should simplify and stabilize the go/loader package's API.  Before that happens, there are a number of features to add and bugs to fix:\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n1) support ... patterns just like \"go build\" and \"go list\" do.  (Ideally the logic would be shared.  Russ suggested fork/execing \"go list\", but I don't like this approach: it uses the actual file system instead of the abstraction defined by build.Context.)\r\n\r\n2) Allow packages specified on the command-line to use cgo.  Currently only imported packages are subject to cgo preprocessing.\r\n\r\n3) Support pkg-config.\r\n\r\nAPI simplifications:\r\n\r\n4) The public fields of loader.Program are sometimes annoying to use.  Study existing clients and come up with something more convenient.\r\n\r\n5) Update the go/types tutorial at https://github.com/golang/example/tree/master/gotypes.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, we should use go/loader in tools such as golint, govet and stringer.\r\n\r\ncc: @griesemer ",
