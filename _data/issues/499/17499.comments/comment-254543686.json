It might work in practice so long as the arguments to poly1305_auth_armv6 are kept alive throughout its lifetime (which they should be).\r\n\r\nPointers are fine because its call tree is NOSPLIT, i.e. once it enters the function it is not preemptible. But I'm worried that the decrements of SP (in many places) may overflow the stack.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not familiar with that code. There may be some thoughts behind it that I missed.",
