	"body": "Thank you for that. It seems that this assembly code has been working only because of luck for a while. I can take a shot at fixing but but there's still something that I don't understand:\r\n\r\n`sum_arm.s:367   0xd1e58 e52de11c        MOVW.W R14, -0x11c(R13)`\r\n\r\nI assumed that this wrote the contents of R14 to the address (R13 - 0x11c). But your comments suggest that it also updates the value of R13? Is that the case? Does it actually set R13 = R13 - 0x11c and then do a write?\r\n\r\n(Probably I should try and setup an ARM environment with qemu or something but I currently don't have anything like that.)",
