Obviously apart from the failing to compile with the above error, what I see is that when attempting to debug docker or containerd on Windows, that gdb64.exe, both directly or indirectly via LiteIDE simply doesn't trigger on breakpoints, or allow any debugging. I used to have this working, circa go 1.4.3 timeframe, maybe even 1.5.1. Note for the compile error, I might have found a workaround in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12055\r\n\r\n```\r\nSet GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP=c:\\go1.4.3\r\nSet GO_GCFLAGS=-N\r\nIn c:\\go\\src make.bat\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, still no breakpoints trigger.
