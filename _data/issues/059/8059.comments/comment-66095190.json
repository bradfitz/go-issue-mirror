I duplicated small.txt until\nit was 1560200 lines long and ran your sample program over it. The terminal backtrace\nconsumed a lot of memory, but the program itself did not. Is it possible that your\nmemory numbers include the terminal/stdout buffer?\n\nI also put in calls to runtime.ReadMemStats during the main loop. On my machine, I see\nMemStats.Alloc fairly stable around 60k and MemStats.Sys completely stable at 2885880\nbytes.\n\nIf it's not the terminal buffer consuming memory, could you report some memstats numbers\nhere? Also, would you check whether there's a particular section of your large csv file\nthat's required to reproduce this?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
