So exactly 1 finalizer is run per GC. The problem does\nnot show up if either:\n1. fmt.Printf() is replaced with println()\nor 2. main goroutine outputs stats\nor 3. GOMAXPROCS=2\nor 4. main goroutine episodically executes sleep\nSo the issue is just an unfortunate interaction of several factor. I think we are\nclosing it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
