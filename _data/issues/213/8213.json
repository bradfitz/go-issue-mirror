	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe benchmarking part of the \u0026quot;testing\u0026quot; package supports stopping timers while\nperforming complex initialisation. Perhaps something analogous could be added for cpu\nprofiling, so that -cpuprofile can produce a data file that excludes samples for the\ncomplex initialisation.\n\nThe current workaround is to avoid -cpuprofile in favour of calling\nruntime.StartCPUProfile from within the benchmark.\u003c/pre\u003e",
