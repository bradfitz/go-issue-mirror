If you\nviolate those conventions, then it becomes less\nuseful, sometimes actively harmful.\ngo build toy.go writing 'toy' is definitely the right\ndefault.  If it overwrites an important file named\ntoy, well, it did what it was told.\n\nHowever, the remove check should be a little more\ncareful: it should not remove read-only files and\nshould also not remove directories.  It is even possible\nthat we should read the first few bytes from the file\nand make sure it is an executable.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-go1**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to **builder@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
