I'm not sure why I thought it was.\n\nAlso, the passing test at the bottom was meant to be for\ncode.google.com/p/go.tools/astutil, not code.google.com/p/go.tools/imports.\n\nFinally, I'm not completely sure if this bugfix is okay with the 1.3 freeze in mind.\nSorry if not. I thought I'd submit the CL in order to find out.\u003c/pre\u003e",
