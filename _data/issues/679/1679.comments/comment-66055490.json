And it needs to be in the language specification\nso that compilers agree on whether a program should be\nrejected or not.\n\nYou probably already know, but the workarounds are\n(preferred anyway, see Effective Go):\n\nfunc f(x int) bool {\n    if x \u003e 5 {\n        return false\n    }\n    return true\n}\n\nand\n\nfunc f(x int) bool {\n    if x \u003e 5 {\n        return true\n    } else {\n        return false\n    }\n    panic(\"unreachable\")\n}\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Duplicate**._\n\n_Merged into issue #65._",
