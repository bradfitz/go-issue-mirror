	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eHere are two functions that won't compile:\n\nfunc f(x int) bool {\n    if x \u0026gt; 5 {\n        return true\n    } else {\n        return false\n    }\n}\n\nfunc g(x int) bool {\n    switch {\n    case x \u0026gt; 5: return true\n    default: return false\n    }\n}\n\nIsn't it possible to make these compile? Perhaps I'm being naive, but if the last\nstatement in a function that requires a return is an if or a switch and the if has an\nelse with a return or the switch has a default with a return isn't that sufficient to\nknow that the function will work? Or are you having to allow for gotos or something else\nsubverting the flow of control?\u003c/pre\u003e",
