Imagine if we could detect a bad pointer immediately when it is generated, then we could (and I argue should) panic when the user code generates one, not throw.\r\n\r\nIn the cgo checks we have a natural place where we can panic.\r\n\r\nthrow is not defined in the language spec.  We should prefer panic if feasible.",
