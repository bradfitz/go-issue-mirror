Implementation restrictions do pose a certain problem because if a compiler (say the default compiler) has those restrictions; effectively it means that programs must fit within those restrictions (it's not like there's a lot of alternative implementations).\r\n\r\nFor instance, the NUL byte restriction is really not important for Go per se, and in fact it costs an extra test for each source byte read by the compiler. It's there to prevent trouble with other tools which (historically) may have had trouble dealing with NUL bytes.\r\n\r\nWe will have a fresh look at this when we get to it. This is not urgent.",
