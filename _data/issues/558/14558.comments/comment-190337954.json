However it would help to better understand some of the aspects of what's defined as an expected behavior are actually mandatory and some aspects can be optional. \r\n\r\nPlease don't take those two examples only, I've quickly took them to prove a point.\r\n\r\nAnd, to clarify this, it's not about the programs the end-users of the language write but rather what guarantees/expectations the language/compiler/runtime set/provide. To give an example: just because I know that in the current gc `uint8(255) + uint8(1) = uint(0)` it doesn't mean I'll necessarily use that. But if I rely on that feature and it changes from Go 1.6 to Go 1.7 because the compiler / runtime changed then this will become a problem.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
