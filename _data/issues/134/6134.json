I believe this code is correct.\n\nFor older ARM processors, which are supported by Go, these instructions do not exist. \nOn Linux, there is a primitive provided by the kernel that cooperates with the scheduler\nto provide a the same primitive. However, non-Linux targets do not have similar\nfunctionality.\n\nSince non-Linux ARM targets are not generally well supported, a viable option might be\nto discontinue support for ARMv5 CPUs on those systems and require a CPU that supports\nat least the ARMv6K instructions.\u003c/pre\u003e",
