I had to correct the environment var GOBIN on\nmy system, which lacked a '\\' between '%GOROOT%' and 'bin' (now wondering why I didn't\nhave problems with that before).\nNow the command to install gotour offline created folders '%GOROOT%' and therein 'bin'\nin the folder from which I ran the go get command (...\\%GOROOT%\\bin\\gotour.exe). So it\nlooks that the '%GOROOT%' part in GOBIN is not substituted. When I change the content of\nGOBIN into 'C:\\Programs\\Go\\bin' (instead of '%GOROOT%\\bin') everything works well, which\nconfirms the above.\nI see 2 solutions: (1) use GOROOT and append 'bin' or '\\bin' to it instead of using\nGOBIN, (2) make the installer code substitute any %...% parts in GOBIN. Of which (1) is\nthe easiest I think.\u003c/pre\u003e",
