Instead, I have created gocmd.bat\nbatch file on my Desktop. The file has something like:\n\nset GOROOT=c:\\go\nset GOPATH=c:\\gopath\nset PATH=%PATH%;c:\\mingw\\bin;%GOROOT%\\bin\ncd %GOROOT%\\src\ncmd\n\nIf I want to do some Go coding, I just double click on that file, and I have command\nwindow with all environment setup as needed.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
