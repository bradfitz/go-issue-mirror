	"body": "by **roarofthefour**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe time zone records for Israel, Gaza, and some other places are not available via the\n\u0026quot;time\u0026quot; package anymore, if you are using recent versions of zoneinfo.zip (such\nas the one supplied with Go 1.2).\n\nYou can get at these time zone records if your zoneinfo.zip is old enough.\n\nThat's not good because zoneinfo.zip needs to be kept up-to-date with the latest changes\nto Daylight Savings Time rules by various governments of the world.\n\nRecords for IANA time zones in zoneinfo.zip contain a version number.\nMost records are version 2.\nSome of them are version 3 now, such as Asia/Jerusalem, Asia/Gaza.\n\nThe following lines in the function loadZoneData\n\n// 1-byte version, then 15 bytes of padding\n\tvar p []byte\n\tif p = d.read(16); len(p) != 16 || p[0] != 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; p[0] != '2' {\n\t\treturn nil, badData\n\t}\n\nshould be changed to\n\n// 1-byte version, then 15 bytes of padding\n\tvar p []byte\n\tif p = d.read(16); len(p) != 16 || p[0] != 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; p[0] != '2' || p[0] != '3' {\n\t\treturn nil, badData\n\t}\n\nto accommodate version 3.\n\nThe difference between version 2 records and version 3 does not concern loadZoneInfo,\nbecause it does not read the part of the record which may be different under version 3,\nthat is, the POSIX TZ string.\u003c/pre\u003e",
