I think either of your two first suggestions are nice. In my head os.Environ returns a map (similar to %ENV in perl and probably others), but that's in stone.\r\n\r\nPerhaps? : \r\n 1. os.GetenvCheck that returns syscall.Getenv() \r\n 1. os.EnvironMap that takes syscall.Environ() and parses it first. Alternatively, it could be pushed down into the various env_* syscall levels to avoid extra work. I don't have a plan9 or Windows system to test these with though.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to take a stab at either/both solutions if they sound good. ",
