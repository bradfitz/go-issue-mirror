If my cwd is `$GOPATH/src/github.com/cespare/foo`, I am much more likely to type\r\n\r\n    go build ./bar\r\n    go test ./bar\r\n\r\nthan\r\n\r\n    go build github.com/cespare/foo/bar\r\n    go test github.com/cespare/foo/bar\r\n\r\n\u003e and only works as intended (relative to cwd) when used out of GOPATH.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean, and where is it documented?",
