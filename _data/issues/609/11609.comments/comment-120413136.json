That design decision was made long ago, and CL 12022 is intended to make that more clear.\r\n\r\nIf the Windows code does not respect affinity, that is a bug in the Windows support.  I don't know anything about affinity on Windows; I encourage you to open a separate issue with appropriate details to fix the Windows runtime.  Thanks.",
