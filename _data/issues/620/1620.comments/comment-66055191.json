However, inserting some\ncode that effectively does nothing (x := 2; _ = x) stops the crashing. After doing that,\nI was not able te reproduce the crash.\n\nI compiled both the crashing and the non-crashing program to assembly and compared the\noutput. There is, of course, an extra \"MOVL    $2,x+-392(SP)\" in the non-crashing\nassembly code. Because of this, addresses in other parts of the code are shifted, and\nsome jump addresses are different, but that shouldn't change the behavior of the program.\n\nMaybe someone can pinpoint the problem using the two attached assembly outputs?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1620/5/crashing.S\"\u003ecrashing.S\u003c/a\u003e (1102948 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1620/5/notcrashing.S\"\u003enotcrashing.S\u003c/a\u003e (1102995 bytes)",
