	"body": "The heap profiler doesn't sample based on locations at all.  It samples every N allocations.  A program like yours, in which there is a common multiple between the loops and the allocations, is going to break the algorithm.  But you can control the profiling rate: see http://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#pkg-variables .\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this as working-as-expected, but please feel free to reopen if you have specific suggestions for how to change the behaviour.",
