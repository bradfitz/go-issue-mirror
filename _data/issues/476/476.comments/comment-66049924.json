I have managed to reproduce it on Snow Leopard by syncing to the specific version \nyou were using and then using export GOGC=0 to trigger extra garbage collections.  \nThe strangest part is that I can only reproduce it by running \"make test\" in \ntesting/quick.  If I run \"gotest\" (which is what \"make test\" eventually does) then it \ndoesn't fail.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
