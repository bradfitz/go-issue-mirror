With musl, libpthread, like other libraries, are all bundled into a single library. That includes the dynamic linker: http://wiki.musl-libc.org/wiki/Design_Concepts#Unified_libc.2Flibpthread.2Fldso\r\n\r\nHowever, I've just tested Go 1.6 on the musl version of Void Linux and cannot reproduce the segfault. It is a 64 bit machine, unlike OP's 32 bit.",
