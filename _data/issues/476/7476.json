	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe addrspace_free function in runtime/mem_linux.c checks large chunks of memory using\nmincore.  mincore returns 0 if the memory is accessible, ENOMEM if some of the memory is\nunmapped.  The current code seems to think that ENOMEM is returned if all of the memory\nis unmapped, but that is not correct.  ENOMEM is returned if only some of the memory is\nunmapped.  Since we normally map only some of the memory, this means that addrspace_free\ndoes not actually return whether the address space is free.\u003c/pre\u003e",
