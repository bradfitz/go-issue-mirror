I am sure I am missing\nsomething, however exactly the same problem exists when I use Windows 386 build as a\nhost. More than that: if I run \"go build -work test\" and grab a.out from _obj/exe\ndirectory - it runs perfectly on the target platform. I tried this with program more\ncomplex than \"Hello world\" - for example one that opens sqllite database end executes\nsimple query. Looks like linking is actually done and there is an error somewhere which\nresults in a stack corruption...\u003c/pre\u003e",
