	"body": "I think this is an issue because `loadZoneFile` is swallowing error details too much. The most common failure mode for any particular attempt in that function is to get a file not found, which is fine to suppress, but other kinds of errors should be reported back so that callers to `time.LoadLocation` can discover why it's failing.\r\n\r\nHere's my proposal:\r\n  * if `loadZoneFile` finds a file it can successfully load, it reports no error (current behaviour)\r\n  * if no file can be loaded, and there's an error that does *not* satisfy `os.IsNotExist`, report that error (new behaviour)\r\n  * if all the errors satisfy `os.IsNotExist`, report the generic message (current behaviour)\r\n\r\n\r\n@rsc, does that sound okay to you?",
