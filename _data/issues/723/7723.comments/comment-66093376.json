The `importPath`\ncomment is erroneous as you state, but I'm wondering if you could provide some context\nabout the other two points you make.  Perhaps an example of a directory layout for a\ngiven repository and a mismatch between what you expect from FromDir and what it returns\ninstead.\n\n\"- the returned root is a filesystem path, but documenting it as an\n\"import path\" suggests it'll always be slash-separated.\nDoc bug or code bug?\"\n\nCan you clarify this, as well?  What was the import path separated by if not by slashes?\u003c/pre\u003e",
