This\nis my output now:\n\n# hg tags | head\ntip                            16258:0c029965805f\nrelease                        14368:2d8bc3c94ecb\ngo1.0.3                        14368:2d8bc3c94ecb\ngo1.0.2                        13560:5e806355a9e1\n...\n\nAs you can see \"tip\" != \"release\".\n\n\"tip\" is set automatically by \"hg\" itself, when someone commits new change into repo -\nthe \"tip\" will get set onto that latest commit.\n\n\"release\", on the other hand, was set by one of Go Team onto rev=2d8bc3c94ecb. Someone\nwho decided that rev=2d8bc3c94ecb should be \"referred to\" as \"release\" by everyone - it\nis easier to speak of \"release\" then \"rev=2d8bc3c94ecb\" when 2 people discuss it. Note,\nhow go1.0.3 is set to 2d8bc3c94ecb too. So, really, \"release\" == \"go1.0.3\" - they both\nrefer to same version. I suspect, once go1.1 will get released, someone will create a\ngo1.1 label and will set it to a commit, and also move \"release\" to the same commit.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
