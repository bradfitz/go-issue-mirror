What about others? Do you have\nfiles \"networks\", \"protocol\" and \"services\" in C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc ?\n\n\u003e 3) there is no \"HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.bmp\\Content Type\" key\n\nGo mime package tests assume that every user have mime-strings for at least \".bmp\" and\n\".png\" extensions. It doesn't look to hold true in your case for some reason or another.\nSo will try to find other extensions that will work for you. Here\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/i-YINWyd1q\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/i-YINWyd1q\u003c/a\u003e is a program that prints all mime pairs on windows\nsystem. Please, run it on your computer and post your results here. We will check if\n\".bmp\" and \".png\" are present, and will decide on their replacements, if they are not.\nYou might decide not to show this list here on public forum, and that is OK. But please\ncheck for \".bmp\" and \".png\" yourself then, and pick *common* alternative extensions\n(like .txt or .xml) that we could use instead.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
