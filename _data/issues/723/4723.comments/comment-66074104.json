I think the following mimes would be appropriate:\n\u003e    .html: text/html\n\u003e    .txt: text/plain\n\nUnfortunately, these types are special (they are hard coded in mime package). You can\ntry and change initMimeForTests in type_windows.go to see that they don't work and why.\nI propose we change bmp for wav instead:\n\ndiff -r 31065f4dbca5 src/pkg/mime/type_windows.go\n--- a/src/pkg/mime/type_windows.go\tWed Feb 13 22:34:37 2013 -0500\n+++ b/src/pkg/mime/type_windows.go\tThu Feb 14 15:18:01 2013 +1100\n@@ -58,7 +58,7 @@\n \n func initMimeForTests() map[string]string {\n \treturn map[string]string{\n-\t\t\".bmp\": \"image/bmp\",\n+\t\t\".wav\": \"audio/wav\",\n \t\t\".png\": \"image/png\",\n \t}\n }\n\nCan you see, if that change fixes your mime test, please?\n\nAlso, please, update your source to the tip, run all tests and post your log here.
