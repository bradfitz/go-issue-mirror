It is very wasteful, because it copies\n(clones) all repository changes (from day one) into your new directory. There could be a\nlot.\n\nOnce you have a hg repository (root directory will have .hg directory with all history\nsaved there), you can download only \"new\" changes by using \"hg pull\" command. \"hg pull\"\ncommand updates .hg directory only, it does not update any files you work with. To\nupdate these to whatever version you want, you should use \"hg up -r \u0026lt;revision\u0026gt;\"\ncommand - the command copies appropriate files from .hg directory into your workspace.\nYou can also see what version you are at by \"hg parent\". If you made changes to files in\nyour workspace, you can see every file you have changed by \"hg st\", or you could see all\nchanges by \"hg diff\". You can discard all these changes by \"hg revert -a\".\n\nSo, really, you should\n\nhg up -r 33d3e7bbd3ef # change workspace files to 33d3e7bbd3ef\nhg parent  # make sure you are on 33d3e7bbd3ef\nhg revert -a # discard all changes\nhg st # make sure nothing is changed - the output should be empty\n# apply whatever changes you need\nhg diff # see changes are good\nmake.bat # build go\n# do the tests\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
