I would expect to see an error message from ld.  All I see here is that ld is\nfailing, but why?  And the exit status of 5 is odd--as far as I know the GNU linker\nnever exits with a status other than 0 or 1.\n\nThe dist tool is showing you the exact command that failed--what happens if you run that\ncommand yourself?\u003c/pre\u003e",
