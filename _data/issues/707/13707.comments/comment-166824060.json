	"body": "hey! thanks for getting back to me. After I looked at it more I found the underlying issue. I had an infinite loop later in my main function which i used for debugging purposes. Anyways, when main goroutine would reach that for loop it wouldn't release control so another routine would run. I thought I read somewhere in Go 1.2 ( I believe) this was fixed, but maybe not in the way I thought. Which is more strange is that for some reason the GOMAXPROCS is being defaulted to just 1 when i am running either 1.6 or 1.5.2 ( i have an i7). When I set GOMAXPROCS to higher than 1 it will work. Thoughts?",
