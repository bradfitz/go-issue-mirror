	"body": "This problem was reported in gccgo from gcc 5 (latest branch) when built on ppc64le because the IOCTL constant value TUNSETIFF is not defined in gccgo, but is available in gc from golang 1.5 in the generated files zerrors_linux_ppc64.go and zerrors_linu_ppc64le.go.\r\n\r\nIn the gccgo build, I can see that HAVE_LINUX_IF_TUN_H is defined, which allows the correct include file for these defines to be found, but mksysinfo.sh does not appear to handle them correctly.  Instead the gen-sysinfo.go file contains:\r\n\r\n// unknowndefine TUNSETIFF _IOW('T', 202, int)\r\n\r\nfor this define and all the other TUNSET* constants.\r\n\r\nPossibly because it is a macro defined in terms of another macro and mksysinfo.sh doesn't handle that case?\r\n\r\nThis same problem occurred months ago with other IOCTL constants TIOCS* and the fix was to add some lines to mksysinfo.sh to enable them to be generated.  I don't know if this is the same kind of problem and could be solved the same way.\r\n\r\nThe request would be to add all the TUNSET* constants to gccgo in the gcc5 branch if possible.",
