Note that the timeout is defined for the **aggregate** time of all tests: \r\n\r\n\u003e \"if positive, sets an aggregate time limit for all tests\". \r\n\r\nIn the \"go test -timeout=1s -v\" run, all your parallel tests get run in parallel and are able to complete within the given timeout (by chance, I guess).  \r\n\r\nIn the \"go test -timeout=1s -parallel=1 -v\" run, as the parallel test are run in sequence, it is guaranteed to panic.  On my install, I see a PASS for the first test (both for an old version of go and the one including my changes). But I guess it depends on how lucky you are, as the timeout is so close to the running time.",
