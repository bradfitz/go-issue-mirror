	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI received a private bug report from a user who doesn't want to create an account to\nfile a bug here.\n\nUnfortunately, the bug report has no repro case.\n\nIn summary: in readDirectoryHeader, we can read too far into a zip64 Extra block.  The\nExtra block is a repeated list of (extra tag + size + extra bytes of declared size). \nWhen we see the extra tag of 1 (zip64ExtraId), we then parse the extra block assuming\nthe buffer is everything remaining in the file, instead of capping it at the declared\nsize.  That matters, because the Extra field is a variably-sized structure:\n\n        Value      Size       Description\n        -----      ----       -----------\n(ZIP64) 0x0001     2 bytes    Tag for this \u0026quot;extra\u0026quot; block type\n        Size       2 bytes    Size of this \u0026quot;extra\u0026quot; block\n        Original \n        Size       8 bytes    Original uncompressed file size\n        Compressed\n        Size       8 bytes    Size of compressed data\n        Relative Header\n        Offset     8 bytes    Offset of local header record\n        Disk Start\n        Number     4 bytes    Number of the disk on which\n                              this file starts \n\n      This entry in the Local header MUST include BOTH original\n      and compressed file size fields. If encrypting the \n      central directory and bit 13 of the general purpose bit\n      flag is set indicating masking, the value stored in the\n      Local Header for the original file size will be zero.\u003c/pre\u003e",
