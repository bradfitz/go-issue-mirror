You can play by invoking the go build of a command with -ldflags=-hostobj but if it\nbreaks you get to keep both pieces.\n\nDwarf information is not correct, so you might need -ldflags='-w -hostobj' depending on\nhow paranoid the system linker is.\n\nWindows has not been attempted yet.\nARM has not been attempted yet.\n\nThere is a real possibility that ARM and Windows will be skipped for this go-round.\u003c/pre\u003e",
