It's been built by the community, and some of those people\nare now committers themselves.  Nobody working on the core Go tools is likely to work on\nthis.\n\nWhat this needs is somebody who understands how to modify the Go linker to optionally\ngenerate a Windows object file instead of the Windows executable that it currently\ngenerates.  This mostly means a different image header, and generating relocations.  The\nwork should not be particularly hard for somebody with a clear understanding of the\nPE/COFF object file format.\u003c/pre\u003e",
