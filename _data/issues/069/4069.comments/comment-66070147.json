However, that is not the normal mode and I don't see why we should\nsupport it to start.  When not compiling PIC and not putting the code into a shared\nlibrary there is no need to call __tls_get_addr.  Instead, 6l would generate a\nR_X86_64_TPOFF32 reloc on a \"mov %fs:0,REG\" instruction.  8l would generate a\nR_386_TLE_LE reloc on a \"mov %gs:0,REG\" instruction.  Not sure about 5l; we may need a\n__aeabi_read_tp call there for ARMv5.  For sufficiently new ARM processors we can use an\nmrc instruction to get the value and a R_ARM_TLS_LE32 reloc to get the offset.\u003c/pre\u003e",
