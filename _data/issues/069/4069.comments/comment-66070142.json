The 6l and 8l linkers already had a\nconcept of a relocation and recorded the places that needed to be relocated, as part of\nthe standard linking, so that individual functions could be laid out separately and put\ntogether only at the end. Adjusting them to emit the not-applied relocations was fairly\nstraightforward. \n\n5l does not have that flexibility: it lays out the entire code segment at once, because\nI never changed it like I did 6l and 8l. So the required changes are more spread out\nthan in 6l/8l. Any part of the code layout in asm.c that uses -\u003epc or -\u003evalue is\nsuspect. However, the simplicity of the ARM instruction set might make it easier to find\nthese.\n\nAt the least, the two 'TODO: Use addrel' comments need to do that, although the one for\nUNDEF could be changed into two instructions instead (MOVW $0, R0; BL R0). Also any case\nlisted in the table for C_SBRA or C_ADDR arguments, so cases 5, 11, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69,\n74, 93, 94. It could be that most of the work is in addpool. It's all very unclear to me.\u003c/pre\u003e",
