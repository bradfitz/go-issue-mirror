The preconditions we have are:\r\n\r\n- The `Response` after an error from `CheckRedirect` must be non-nil for go1 compatibility (issue #3795)\r\n- We can't *require* closing the `Response.Body`, since there was an error, and the general practice is to discard the response altogether on errors.\r\n\r\nTwo possible solutions:\r\n\r\n- Replace the `Body` with an empty, noop `io.ReadCloser`, so that a later `Read` or `Close` doesn't error, but we still discard the body. \r\n- Read the response into a buffer (up to `maxBodySlurpSize`?), and replace the `Body` with that buffer.\r\n\r\n",
