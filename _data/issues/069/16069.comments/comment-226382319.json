	"body": "The last stack trace looks like what you want, right?  As I understand it, you expect a crash, and the bug is that the program hangs instead of crashing.  So it sounds like it only hangs when `GOMAXPROCS` is 1.  Am I understanding this correctly?\r\n\r\nYou didn't answer my question about Delve, but let me ask a different question.  When the program is hanging, hit ^\\ or (equivalently) send the process a SIGQUIT signal.  That should dump a stack trace.  Tell us that stack trace.  Thanks.",
