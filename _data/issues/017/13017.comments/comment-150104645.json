	"body": "Thanks for being so polite, Ian. I strive to emulate your example of good manners. Indeed I should have highlighted the buildmode=c-shared. I was so immersed in the project that it didn't occur to me that it was not obvious.\r\n\r\nAnd yes you nailed it. My initial gcc call on interface.cpp was indeed the problem.  I just couldn't figure out from those linker errors which of the many compiled files it was complaining about. Thank you so much for pointing out the problem. Compilation on linux and OSX can't be expected to require the same build flags, I must keep reminding myself.\r\n\r\nFor anyone in the future looking at this same issue, it was fixed by adding -fPIC to the very first gcc call (the one that I wrote by hand myself to compile some glue code).\r\n\r\n    `gcc -fPIC -c -o interface.o cpp/interface.cpp -Iinclude/`\r\n\r\n",
