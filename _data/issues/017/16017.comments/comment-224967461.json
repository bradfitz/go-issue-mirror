The runtime would initialize faster if it did not copy these bytes out of the auxv and seed its PRNG with it.\r\n\r\nI agree this shouldn't break any correct program or cause any obvious issues, but it may cause subtle issues.  For example a program using many shared libraries could behave more poorly than expected due to the runtimes in each shared library having correlated rather than independent initial random state.  This appears to be an artifact of the way the code is structured rather than a deliberate choice so seems worth examining in more detail.",
