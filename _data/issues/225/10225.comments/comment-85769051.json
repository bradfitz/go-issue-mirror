	"body": "Sorry, I wasn't clear about the background information in this issue.\n\nThe upstream NaCl had a breaking change and removed the support\nfor SecureRandom SRPC service that our binaries rely on, and instead\nintroduced a new getrandom syscall.\n\nEven though the syscall is introduced first and the SRPC interface\nremoved after than, I couldn't find a released version of the NaCl SDK\nthat contains both interfaces. Thus this update to pepper-39 will break\nthe build, and CL 1755 is supposed to fix that. (This is the reason I\ncan't submit that CL without updating the builder, the build will also\nbreak.)\n\nI can build a sel_ldr that supports both interfaces though. If you prefer\nnot to break builds.\n",
