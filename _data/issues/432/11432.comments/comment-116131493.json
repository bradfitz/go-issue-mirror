	"body": "I struggle with this as well in gccgo.  gccgo does of course implement arbitrary inlining (but currently does not do tail calls).  Gccgo does full correct unwinding of inlined functions, using the debug info to track inline sites.  However, this only works with runtime.Caller.  If you use runtime.Callers, and then pass the resulting PC values to FuncForPC, you don't get a proper stack.  At an inlining point, you get the same file/line multiple times.\r\n\r\nI agree with Keith that the best approach is to encode inline positions in the PC value, somehow.",
