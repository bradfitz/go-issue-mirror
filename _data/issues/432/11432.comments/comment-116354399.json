Within the last fortnight, Austin asked for `nm` output to correlate to a stack trace to help debug a runtime bug.\r\n* Relatedly, if we use invented PCs, it would be nice if they were roughly comprehensible given only the binary and appropriate tooling.\r\n* Unsurprisingly given the above, I'm also on the side of \"stack traces are really important\".\r\n* #4899 might be an interesting use case to look at in this connection. It is entangled with testing API design, but entangled in relevant way, I think.\r\n* I'm disinclined to shove stuff into unused bits, as it doesn't fail as reliably as you would want when you miss a spot--and you always miss a spot.\r\n",
