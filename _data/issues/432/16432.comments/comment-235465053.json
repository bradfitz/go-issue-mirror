Yes, that could work, though it may not work so well with GOMAXPROCS=1. One possible approach to preempting the idle worker as soon as there's work is to only run the idle worker on N-1 of the idle Ps, keeping one P truly idle. If that one gets woken up to do work, it would actively halt one of the idle workers to make another P truly idle.",
