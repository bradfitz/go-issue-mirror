We need both. And it looks like your CL (25155) behaves very similarly to my CL (24704) with over-assist turned down to 64k, which is good, because it should. :)\r\n\r\nI think we should move forward with your CL (I'll suggest a few mostly documentation things to pull over from 24704). I'm going to run the benchmark battery against it. And I'll see what other people think of putting this in 1.7.",
