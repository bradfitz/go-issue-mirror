	"body": "That's really interesting! I had tried a very similar change when I was looking at #14812: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/24704/, but found that it didn't help. It's structured slightly differently, but should be equivalent except for two things: I only decreased the over-assist to 512k instead of 64k, and I always added the over-assist rather doing min(over-assist, required work). Would you mind giving CL 24704 a try on your workload, perhaps both with the 512k over-assist and  with the 64k over-assist? I want to make sure we really understand what's going on and what the effect of these changes is.",
