The current proposal goes all the way to get the clip and frame info  but we can't get the actual PCM data (which would probably some sort of `[][int]float` format). Depending on the use case, we might not want to load the entire audio file in memory, so the API might want to take that in consideration.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
