	"body": "Thanks for the input. The proposal is currently on hold and require more work on a variety of topics:\r\n* The interfaces need to consider VBR compression.\r\n* Seeking is often expensive, we may adopt an io.ReadSeeker-like interface to make Seek a standalone operation to put some more emphasis on its cost.\r\n* It is not clear how big a buffer is required for a frame for VBR encoded media. A Frame type may be to introduced. \r\n* We need working prototype decoders for AIFF, FLAC, MP3 and OGG before finalizing the proposal.\r\n",
