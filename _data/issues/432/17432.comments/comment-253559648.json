The obfuscated_ticket_age https://tlswg.github.io/tls13-spec/#rfc.section.4.2.7.2 can be acted upon by crypto/tls after the Unwrap call, with some sane buffer (possibly in Config).\r\n\r\nTicket reuse is allowed anyway, so it's not Unwrap's job to detect replays. So yeah, this interface makes sense for 1.3 IMHO.",
