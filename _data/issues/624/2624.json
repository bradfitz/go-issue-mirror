	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eAn sql.Rows generated in a request handler is not closed automatically, and DB\nconnections stay open until the http.Request is closed. (Until conn.Close() is run?) If\nthe http connection is kept alive, each subsequent request will create a new database\nconnection until the database's resources are exhausted.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Use github.com/jbarham/pgsqldriver (not sure if this is the culprit; setFinalizer\nseems to have been used correctly)\n2. Run many Query(); the resulting Rows won't close by themselves even after having been\ntraversed\n\nWhat is the expected output? No error; only one/a few DB conns used.\n\nWhat do you see instead? Hundreds of DB conns, and finally an error: \u0026quot;conn\nerror:FATAL:  remaining connection slots are reserved for non-replication superuser\nconnections\u0026quot; (PostgreSQL global maximum connection limit reached.)\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)? 6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using? Ubuntu 11.10\n\nWhich revision are you using?  weekly.2011-12-22\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nPoC: \u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/1524739\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/1524739\u003c/a\u003e (run and go to \u003ca href=\"http://localhost:9000/)\"\u003ehttp://localhost:9000/)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
