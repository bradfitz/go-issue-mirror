	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eA reflect.Value obtained from an unexported field does not support .Interface().\nIf you hold such a value there is no way to pass it to fmt.Print to get the underlying\nvalue printed.\n(The usual way is fmt.Print(v.Interface()).)\n\nRog asks for a way to print such a reflect.Value. He has cited two unsafe packages that\ndo this by modifying the Value to remove the 'obtained from unexported field' bit.\n\nTwo possibilities.\n\n1) Add a new type, in either reflect or fmt, that fmt recognizes and prints. \nFor example, type RawValue struct { V reflect.Value }.\n\n2) Make fmt recognize reflect.Value and print the underlying value instead\nof printing the reflect.Value struct as it does today.\u003c/pre\u003e",
