It's all based on the ubuntu-xenial branch (which has 1.6 in it currently), and then there are ppa-golang-1.4, ppa-golang-1.5 and ppa-golang-1.7 branches based on that. (The golang-1.7 packages use a launchpad feature called a \"source package recipe\" to glom the 1.7 debian directory from the packaging branch together with the source from a mirror of the Go repo: https://code.launchpad.net/~mwhudson/+recipe/golang-daily).\r\n\r\nDo you think these would be suitable as a base for the \"official\" packages? If you don't get around to making official packages for a while, would you be open to linking to this archive (or well, the one I plan on creating after people have tested these) from the install docs?",
