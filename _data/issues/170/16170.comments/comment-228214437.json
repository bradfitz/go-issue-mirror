	"body": "PS: The issue is not just present for the wider range of Unicode chars, it is really a font issue. There are plenty of people that (would like to) use a proportional font for programming (me included) - after all proportional fonts are used because they increase readability - but gofmt cannot handle those either, even if it's all English.\r\n\r\nSince gofmt operates on text files which know nothing about character width on the screen, it must assume that all characters have the same width. At best, it could know which characters are an (integer) multiple of the \"unit\" width, and then introduce spaces as necessary. However, that would not solve the general problem and unless an editor follows the same formatting, would look just as ugly.\r\n\r\nUnfortunate.",
