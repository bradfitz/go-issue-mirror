Note the formatting of:\r\n```\r\nvar foo = map[string]string{\r\n\t\"foo\": \"bar\",\r\n\t\"сииииияяяяя\": \"z\",\r\n\t\"f123\": \"foobar\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut:\r\n```\r\nvar foo = map[string]string{\r\n\t\"foo\": \"bar\",\r\n\t\"сииииияяяяя\": \"z\",\r\n\t\"f1234\":       \"foobar\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThere is explicit code in gofmt that computes the length ratio between keys on separate lines. If the ratio between two key lengths becomes too large (or too small, depending which way you divide), the alignment of columns is broken. Here the threshold is crossed between f123 and f1234.\r\n\r\nThe thinking is that we don't want very long such tables where a single long key (possibly far down and not even on the screen when you look at the source) moves all values to the right. It's a heuristic. Your mileage may vary.\r\n",
