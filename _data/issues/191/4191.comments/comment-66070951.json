Instead I'm seeing the wrong\nresponse returned for a request.  Unfortunately, I have not been able to reproduce this\nin a non-production environment.\n\nI was hoping that those of you familiar with this fix would be able to imagine a way\nthat this might happen.  Or possibly point me in the right direction as far as creating\na reproducible test case.\n\nThere are many unique variables in my use of the Transport.  I'm setting deadlines only\non writes. \nFor reference, I'm using this code to wrap the Transport:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/smw1218/falcore/blob/master/upstream/upstream.go\"\u003ehttps://github.com/smw1218/falcore/blob/master/upstream/upstream.go\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe response Body returned by the Transport is also consumed in a possibly strange way\nusing TCP_CORK:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/smw1218/falcore/blob/master/server.go#L249\"\u003ehttps://github.com/smw1218/falcore/blob/master/server.go#L249\u003c/a\u003e\n\nOther random info:\nLinux x86_64\nGOMAXPROCS = 8\u003c/pre\u003e",
