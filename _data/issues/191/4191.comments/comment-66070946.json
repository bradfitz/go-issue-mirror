If err == EAGAIN, then n == -1, then we call to WaitFD, which pauses\ntil the timeout occurs, _THEN_ the loop continues from the top, and detects the deadline\nhas passed, which breaks out of the loop, returning -1, errTimeout.\n\nSetting n = 0 inside the err == EAGAIN condition makes the test pass, but could probably\nbe done more elegantly.\u003c/pre\u003e",
