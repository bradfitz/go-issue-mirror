	"body": "A few more questions that came up:\r\n\r\n- `GCCGO` contains the name of the gccgo executable to use. But whether or not gccgo is installed, it defaults to the value `gccgo`. I could instead print the path of the actually-found gccgo executable, but then you'd see GCCGO=\"\" if there is no GCCGO. Is that okay?\r\n- There is an undocumented `CGO_FFLAGS` environment variable. Document and print in `go env`? Or omit?\r\n- Should `GOARM` and `GO386` always be shown, or only if `GOARCH` is set to a value that they have an effect on?",
