If the environment variable is actually set, it is used for both `go tool cgo` as well as all other compiles.\r\n\r\nSo I'm left with the only option being to show the actual value of the `CGO_CFLAGS` environment variable, defaulting to the empty string. I don't love that because it doesn't reveal that `-g -O2` is being used by default.\r\n\r\nI think I also have to therefore not show the defaults for the other `CGO_*` environment variables, or else it will again cause confusion because users will think `CGO_CFLAGS` defaults to empty when the others do not.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
