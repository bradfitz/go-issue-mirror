It runs fine for a few or ten thousand, but\nconsistently crashes as shown at the bottom of this report.\n\nThe code I'm running is \u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/3822449\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/3822449\u003c/a\u003e -- it uses some data I've got\npublicly available and a server I wrote in go that's not entirely trivial to get running\n(pretty close to it), but I suspect that's not an important detail.  For this code path,\nit's basically http PUT and an io.Copy to the filesystem.\n\n\nThe really nasty part here, as far as I can tell, is that I can't seem to do anything\nabout it.  I tried adding a recover around where I use the http client, but it's not\n\u0026quot;from\u0026quot; my code, so I couldn't trap it.  This is rather catastrophic for my app\n(though I remain hopeful it's a dumb bug in my code).\n\n\n2012/10/03 14:19:10 Unsolicited response received on idle HTTP channel starting \nwith \u0026quot;H\u0026quot;; err=\u0026lt;nil\u0026gt;\npanic: http: unexpected bodyEOFSignal Read after Close; see \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/1725\"\u003eissue #1725\u003c/a\u003e\n\ngoroutine 60 [running]:\nnet/http.(*bodyEOFSignal).Read(0xf8401c08a0, 0xf840340000, 0x800000008000, 0x389\n0, 0x0, ...)\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/net/http/transport.go:826 +0xbb\nio.(*multiReader).Read(0xf8406548d0, 0xf840340000, 0x800000008000, 0xf8000005a8,\n 0x0, ...)\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/io/multi.go:13 +0x85\nio.Copy(0xf8400d11e0, 0xf840654910, 0xf8400d1180, 0xf8406548d0, 0x485a46, ...)\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/io/io.go:360 +0x1a8\nnet/http.(*transferWriter).WriteBody(0xf840129600, 0xf8400cd000, 0xf84006ea40, 0\nx0, 0x0, ...)\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/net/http/transfer.go:194 +0x1a1\nnet/http.(*Request).write(0xf840233000, 0xf8400cd000, 0xf84006ea40, 0x0, 0xf8404\n936c0, ...)\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/net/http/request.go:371 +0x820\nnet/http.(*persistConn).writeLoop(0xf840154b80, 0x0)\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/net/http/transport.go:660 +0x1b6\ncreated by net/http.(*Transport).getConn\n        /Users/dustin/prog/eprojects/go/src/pkg/net/http/transport.go:408 +0x5d6\u003c/pre\u003e",
