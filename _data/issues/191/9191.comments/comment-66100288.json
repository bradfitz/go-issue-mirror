You would probably get the same crash calling\nruntime.GC() instead of zip.OpenReader.\n\nThe problem is that something in the Go heap has a pointer type but contains the value\n0x18, which is invalid.\n\nI can't recreate the problem on GNU/Linux.  I don't see anything in your code that would\ncause it.  This will have to be debugged by somebody with access to a Darwin system.\u003c/pre\u003e",
