Unfortunately there is insufficient information in this bug report to know\nanything about your environment, however there is a good chance it is related to a\ntimecounter issue or the process being starved of CPU time. If I had to guess, I'd say\nthat you're probably running on a (badly?) virtualised platform.\n\nIs this 100% repeatable?\n\nIs this on a virtualised or physical machine? If virtualised, what platform?\n\nIs this a single or multiprocessor machine?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
