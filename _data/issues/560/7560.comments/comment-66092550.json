As I said before, complex64 is not the\nproblem.\n\nI think that Go should forbid referring directly to C structs with fields whose\nalignment can not be represented in Go.  There are many ways to handle this case, the\nmost obvious being, don't use a struct.  Or, for the particular special case of a\nmisaligned complex64 field, use [2]float32.\u003c/pre\u003e",
