It might be entirely possible\nthat other platforms have different alignment constraints so that the field is exposed\non one platform as it is aligned but on a different platform it is omitted because that\nplatform has different alignment constraints causing the field to be misaligned.\n\nPerhaps a more predictable solution has to be devised.\u003c/pre\u003e",
