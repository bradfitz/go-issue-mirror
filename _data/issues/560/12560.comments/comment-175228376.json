External linking mostly just requires elfreloc1 (it might also require changes to the entrypoint?). elfsetupplt, adddynsym, adddynrela are required for cgo with internal linking (they are not implemented for arm64, for example, which only supports cgo via external linking).\r\n\r\nThe runtime stuff in asm_mips64x.s is required for either flavour of cgo, but not external linking.",
