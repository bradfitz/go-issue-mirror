	"body": "I think a good and simple way to approach it would be to add somewhere (Go style guide, or a more internal document) a section that says something like this:\r\n\r\n\u003e If a code generator tool wishes to mark a file as \"generated\" in a way so it can be reliably understood by other tools to be generated, then it must satisfy these criteria:\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e 1. {{Simple rule to follow.}}\r\n\u003e 2. {{Another simple rule that must be followed.}}\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e As an *example*, the following disclaimer will satisfy both the criteria above:\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e {{Example disclaimer template.}}\r\n\r\nThat way, people who don't want to be creative can just copy/paste that example disclaimer template and use it.\r\n\r\nHowever, if someone wants to add more details or make their disclaimer different, they can still do that. They just need to follow rules 1 and 2 so that it can still be recognized by tools as a generated disclaimer header.\r\n\r\nTo detect if a given file is generated, you'd only need to check if those described rules are satisfied - no need for any other heuristics. (If there are some false negatives, then the *generator* can be updated to satisfy the rules, instead of muddying the detection algorithm.)\r\n\r\nI think putting it that way makes this workable. I don't think it's possible to enforce a single header format that will satisfy everyone's needs/wants and have people be okay with it. But providing simple rules that the header will follow and giving an example would work splendidly.",
