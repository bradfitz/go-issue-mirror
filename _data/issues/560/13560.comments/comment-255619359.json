The format of the comment is irrelevant (and as such language independent)\r\n2. There is even no need to open the file to check if the file is generated, both by humans and by tools. This will also make tools faster (such as golint) which can skip the file immediately based on filename, instead of forcing them to open the file and inspect the source code for comments.",
