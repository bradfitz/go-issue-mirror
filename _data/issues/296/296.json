Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nThis is kind of specific, but I'm reporting from a live use scenario; I'll \nwork on a small testcase soon, but right now it's late.\n\n1. Handle http requests with something that stores callback functions for \nmatched URLs in a vector (e.g. a controller).\n2. In the handling function, loop over the vector with route := range \n(foo).Iter();\n3. Run ab over it and watch the memory usage rise steadily, rather quickly.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nSlight memory increase that drops back to normal once the benchmark is \nover. Instead, memory usage rose a steady 2% per second (out of 6 gigs) \neventually gobbling it all up and leaving me holding ctrl-C as my music \nskips.\n\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nsrc $ env | grep GO\nGOBIN=/home/alex/bin\nGOARCH=amd64\nGOROOT=/home/alex/go\nGOOS=linux\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nsrc $ hg identify\n2f32e74ab96e tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\u003ca href=\"http://gopaste.org/view/QM696\"\u003ehttp://gopaste.org/view/QM696\u003c/a\u003e - Abridged, with an example of what doesn't \nleak.\n\u003ca href=\"http://gopaste.org/view/ChRC8#LC42\"\u003ehttp://gopaste.org/view/ChRC8#LC42\u003c/a\u003e - Full source.
