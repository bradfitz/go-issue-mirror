	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.7.1 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\namd64\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\nI'm trying to pinning a TLS cert for a HTTP/2 server, so I have a custom `http.Transport` with its TLSClientConfig set like:\r\n```go\r\n TLSClientConfig: \u0026tls.Config{\r\n     RootCAs:    pool,\r\n     NextProtos: []string{\"h2\", \"http/1.1\"},\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nFrom current documentation, `TLSNextProto` is nil, so the transport should be upgraded to HTTP/2 automatically and the request to the server should success.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\nThe request failed with:\r\n```shell\r\nhttp2: server: error reading preface from client 127.0.0.1:36682: bogus greeting \"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: 12\"\r\n```\r\nIt still use a http/1.1 transport after negotiated for h2.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that after the change with https://github.com/golang/go/issues/14275, if either `TLSClientConfig` or `Dial` or `DialTLS` is set for a `http.Transport`, the automatically upgrade [will not happen](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/c1e06dcb611822ba3c881b170f278d18237372c9/src/net/http/transport.go#L202). But the current documentation of `http.Transport` doesn't mention this.\r\n",
