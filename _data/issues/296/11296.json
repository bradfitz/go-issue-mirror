	"body": "`runInit(cmd *command) error` is a long block. It might be improved by being split in multiple functions or by the introduction of higher level abstractions. We might introduce a high-level build/init package out of the cmd package, in a similar fashion of `go/build` and cmd/gomobile can simply invoke the `x/mobile/build` package.\r\n\r\n/cc @crawshaw @hyangah ",
