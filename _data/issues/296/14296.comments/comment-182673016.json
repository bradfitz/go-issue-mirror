Looking at your go1.6.txt, I never see an IPv6 connect succeed, but it tries. The DNS finds both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and the IPv4 ones succeed, wasting your file descriptors (since you never close anything, as you intended), and then eventually you see the errors from the IPv6 failures. You're probably hitting a Happy Eyeballs dial where both IPv6 and IPv4 are tried, and normally your IPv6 fails but it's okay because the IPv4 takes over, but in the final case your IPv6 fails and the IPv4 can't help take over because it's out of fds.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you seem to be having network problems.\r\n\r\nI don't think the error message matters too much.\r\n\r\nBut maybe @mikioh has other opinions.\r\n",
