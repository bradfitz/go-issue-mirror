When you assign a slice \nto something, you're just assigning a pointer, not creating a copy of the data.\n\nIn your example, you only allocate the 2-byte array pType once (with make), and then \nassign the reference to it to several slots of paramType. The results you see are \nexpected. It seems like you get this now, though. :-)\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
