There's little to be gained to putting it in /x/, but a lot of burden.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, one concrete API suggestion: use `Done() \u003c-chan struct{}` instead of `chan bool`. That's the normal Go pattern these days (e.g. `Context.Done`, `Request.Cancel`, `Dialer.Cancel`, ignoring the old mistake of `CloseNotifier` which used a `bool`).\r\n\r\nWe can revisit this if we find reviewers and/or BOSH becomes an increasingly important dependency for other packages.",
