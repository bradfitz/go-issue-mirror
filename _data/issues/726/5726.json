	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIn the current binary build of Go 1.1.1 on Mac OS X, cgo builds do not appear to use the\nsystem linker.\n\nFor a go program that must be linked using the system linker (eg: uses static libs on\nOSX), this causes the link step to fail.\n\nThe following program which uses a statically linked SQLite driver fails to compile:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/wwVyvuINwF\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/wwVyvuINwF\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe issue happen in the binary release of 1.1.1 (and 1.1) but does not happen at tip, or\nthe homebrew version of go 1.1.1, so it seems likely that only the binary version of go\nis affected. Comparing the output of successful runs to unsuccessful ones with the\noption \u0026quot;-ldflags -v\u0026quot; to the go tool shows that link steps for the working\nversions calls the system linker while the binary version does not.\n\nForcing go to use the system linker (-linkmode=external), results in successful builds\nin the binary distribution.\n\nThe issue has been confirmed on OSX Lion \u0026amp; Mountain Lion (10.7 \u0026amp; 10.8), for the\nbinary distributions of go 1.1 and go 1.1.1. It has only been tested on darwin 6l, but I\nsuspect it will be the same for 8l.\n\nI have attached the result of running the following commands on tip, the homebrew\nversion of go 1.1.1, and the binary release of go 1.1.1:\n  - go version\n  - go clean -x -i code.google.com/p/go-sqlite/go1/sqlite3 (to clean up any sqlite3.a file in GOPATH)\n  - go run -x -ldflags -v main.go (where main.go contains the playground snippet)\n\nAlso, see the discussion at\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#\u003c/a\u003e!topic/golang-nuts/QEi1C4XE89I\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5726/0/tip.log\"\u003etip.log\u003c/a\u003e (20054 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5726/0/binary.log\"\u003ebinary.log\u003c/a\u003e (20566 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5726/0/homebrew.log\"\u003ehomebrew.log\u003c/a\u003e (20147 bytes)",
