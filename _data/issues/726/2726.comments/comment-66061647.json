Minor cleanup CL that does not affect performance (removing dead code):\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/5577061/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/5577061/\u003c/a\u003e\n\n2. The second CL dramatically reduce the amount of calls to runtime.GC from\nhuffmanEncoder: \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/5573076/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/5573076/\u003c/a\u003e (not completely ready to submit)\n\nThe second CL depends on the first (unintentionally).\n\nStats are given for the maximum compression level (-9):\n\ngutenberg:\n\ngzip: 37.52\nGo: 76 (2.02x)\npatched Go: 74.43 (1.98x, 2% improvement -- it's because most of the time it's doing\nfindMatch)\n\navi:\n\ngzip: 46.21\nGo: 90 (1.95x)\npatched Go: 67.79 (1.47x, 25% improvement)\n\nObviously, GC issues only affect large files, but anyway, it's probably the right step.\nI will provide stats for other compression levels tomorrow.\u003c/pre\u003e",
