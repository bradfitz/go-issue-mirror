Since this code is not exported other Go tools like\n\u0026quot;golint\u0026quot; would have to reimplement or copy it. I propose that this should be\nput into a public API so that third party Go projects can use the exact same behavior.\n\nI am willing to do the coding part but I need some guidance on where I should move the\nfunctions and how to properly name them.\u003c/pre\u003e",
