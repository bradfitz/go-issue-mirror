This is a fundamental feature advertised by the tool but implemented for machines not for human users.\r\n\r\n\u003e Why is that too hard?\r\n\r\nThe promise of the tool is to provide coverage, yet it only provides coverage readable by machines. I would expect the Go tool to be human-first.\r\n\r\nIt still can output a coverprofile to be consumed by other tools. But the user of the Go tool is primarily a human. And I don't know why we need to depend on an alias to achieve something that is commonly required. The current situation only encourages users to write more makefiles or create aliases replace the go tool.",
