It seems that auto-removal of temporary files can't \nbe reliably done with finalizers. \n\nThis is an outline of a solution from the paper:  add a table of temp files to the \nruntime, and a cleanup() method that removes them. The cleanup method would have to \nrun before the program exits. \n\nA more generic version of this would be to have some variant of finalizers that are \nguaranteed to run before the program exits.\u003c/pre\u003e",
