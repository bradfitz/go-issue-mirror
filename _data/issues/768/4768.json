	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCurrently if the capacity of a slice is unspecified during a make call, the slice is\ncreated with the capacity equal to the length. As far as I can tell, the spec does not\nspecify this behavior. Can this behavior be counted on, or if I want to ensure the slice\ndoes not use up extra memory do I need to call \ns := make([]T, len, len) ?\n\nA clarification in the spec either way would be nice.\u003c/pre\u003e",
