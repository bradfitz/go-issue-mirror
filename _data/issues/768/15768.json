	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.6.2 \r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\ndarwin/amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIn package image/gif, I'm trying to use EncodeAll() to create a non-looping animated gif with several frames, but it will always loop. In the GIF specifications `0` means forever, so `-1` should the way to _go_ to disable looping, unfortunately setting this value does not work in go.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI should be able to set `LoopCount = -1` and my resulting gif should not loop.\r\nI want an animated gif, but not a looping animated gif.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nMy output gif is looping forever (same as LoopCount = `0`).\r\n\r\nThe first problem lies in [src/image/gif/write.go](https://golang.org/src/image/gif/writer.go)\r\n```\r\n   299\t\tif g.LoopCount \u003c 0 {\r\n   300\t\t\tg.LoopCount = 0\r\n   301\t\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should be removed to allow a negative value.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is that Netscape Looping extension header is written in the file whenever there are several frames:\r\n```\r\n   147\t\tif len(e.g.Image) \u003e 1 {\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this should be changed to:\r\n```\r\nif len(e.g.Image) \u003e 1 \u0026\u0026 e.g.LoopCount \u003e= 0 {\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother way to fix the problem would be to change the meaning of LoopCount '0' value to actual \"no loop\", but this could break the expected behaviour for some people. As in other languages, setting `-1` sounds ok as long as it's commented somewhere.",
