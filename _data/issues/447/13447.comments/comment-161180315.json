Mind you, I use current Go tip. We also have TestLookupPort in net package that checks that net.LookupPort(\"tcp\", \"-1\") fails. Can you run that test to see if it PASSes? You can add your values to the test to see what is going on. You can also debug this yourself (since it is broken for you). Just add fmt.Printf or similar everywhere in net as you descend into net.LookupPort call. Please let us know how you went. Thank you.\r\n\r\nAlex",
