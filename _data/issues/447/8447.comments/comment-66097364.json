That is why it has to go into the syscall\npackage because we have no reliable way to insert code in-between the fork and exec.\n\nLike the comment above using a helper process to write the mappings does work but\ncapabilities are lost when the fork'd process tries to update it's own UID/GID mappings.\u003c/pre\u003e",
