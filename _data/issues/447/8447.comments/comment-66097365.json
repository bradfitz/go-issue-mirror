If UID/GID are passed setuid/setgid in child will fail since\n   linux returns invalid arguments for setuid/setgid for any unmapped values.\n   (With patch and mappings written, this succeeds as the mappings have been written.)\n3. child execs any binary (nsinit in case of docker which isn't setuid) and since the\nchild isn't root it loses capabilities. With the patch we ensure that it is root, so it\nhas all capabilities and is able to do further setup before exec'ing into user supplied\ncommand.\u003c/pre\u003e",
