One approach we tried was\nwriting the mappings after the child is exec'ed. In that case, child does become root\n(if the parent writes the correct mappings), but it has lost capabilities on exec\n(unless the binary was a setuid), so it is very limited in what it could do. It can't\neven switch to the docker user since CAP_SETUID/CAP_SETGID are lost. This led us to the\npath of pursuing this patch.\u003c/pre\u003e",
