Code that has to run between fork and exec more\nor less has to run in the syscall support, otherwise the os and os/exec packages can't\nuse it.\n\nI'm not sure I understand that CL, though.  It looks like that CL was never even mailed\nout.  Is it ready for review?  Why does it use a pipe rather than simply opening the\nfile in the child?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.4**, removed **release-none**._",
