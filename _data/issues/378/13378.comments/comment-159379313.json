	"body": "Sorry guys, I could not comment on the CL in time. I believe that the documentation added does not address the issue.\r\nIt is very clear that zero elements inside arrays are transmitted. The issue is about struct fields. The doc says that zero value fields are omitted, and this implies that zero value fields of type array are omitted. In fact, a field of type slice with nil value is omitted. But a field of type array with zero value is not omitted. The existing documentation about struct fields is technically wrong. Hope I was clear enough. @ianlancetaylor ",
