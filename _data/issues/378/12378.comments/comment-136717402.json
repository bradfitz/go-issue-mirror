We could probably get past the initial stall (which is probably caused by the fact we don't return from onNativeWindowRedrawNeeded until a paint is successful) but before long the event channel will fill and the program will run out of memory. If we adopt @nigeltao's paint cycle proposal (which I would like to) it will take a lot longer to run out of memory, but it remains true: an empty app will not be successful on android.",
