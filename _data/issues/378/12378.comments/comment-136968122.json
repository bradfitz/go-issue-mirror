Additionally, several spots on the minimal app creates confusion. I am wondering whether I could ever implement anything in the lines 1 and 3 below, and it is not obvious how these lines fit into the activity's lifecycle. Docs clarifying the questions below could have been useful.\r\n\r\n``` go\r\nfunc main() {\r\n  // line1: should i ever put code before the Main function?\r\n  app.Main(func(a app.App) {\r\n    //  line2: what is the difference between this line and the main function's first line?\r\n    for range a.Events() {\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n  // line3: is it ok to put code after the Main function? is it equivalent of onDestroy? \r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
