	"body": "This is a side-effect of the pruning of the search space we now do. We have a function which determines whether a package like \"fooproto\" might appear in a directory as a function of its directory name, considering mostly its final two path components.\r\n\r\nIt ignores case, and drops hyphens and periods, and then looks for substrings. But \"fooproto\" doesn't appear in \"foo/proto\". I suppose I could also try concatenating the last two path components and searching that too.\r\n\r\nBut does that solve the general problem?\r\n\r\nHow do protobuf package names \u0026 directory names look like in the wild? I haven't been following what the conventions are outside of Google or at least outside of Google open source projects.\r\n",
