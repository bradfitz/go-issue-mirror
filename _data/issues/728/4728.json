	"body": "by **hanks_j@ligo-wa.caltech.edu**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n1. Setup a web-server serving https with a certificate from a local CA\n\n2. Point the program listed at \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/iKScTFUQl3\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/iKScTFUQl3\u003c/a\u003e at the server\n\n3. The program is unable to complete the TLS handshake.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nThe program should complete a TLS handshake and exit without errors.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nTwo error conditions:\n 1. if certificate verification is enabled, it states that the certificate is signed by an unknown authority\n 2. if certificate verification is disabled, it states that there is a bad record MAC.\n\nI have verified that the certificate chain is complete, that the certificate and key are\nthe correct pair.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\ngc\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nUbuntu 10.04 amd 64bit\nDebian 6 amd 64bit\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\nTested on 1.0.2, 1.0.3, tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThis could be a problem with my CA setup.  However the CA and the test web server\nsatisfy both gnutls and openssl.  Both report the certificate chain as being valid.  I\ncan make the connection with anything else.\n\nI have attached a sample certificate, key, and ca certificate that I tested against.  It\nis a horribly weak key.  However key length does not seem to change the outcome.  I have\ntested this with 512 bit and 2048 bit rsa keys.\n\nI ran into this issue while attempting to consume a https resource in a program I am\nworking on.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4728/0/server1_cert.pem\"\u003eserver1_cert.pem\u003c/a\u003e (1018 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4728/0/server1_key.pem\"\u003eserver1_key.pem\u003c/a\u003e (493 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4728/0/ca-cert.pem\"\u003eca-cert.pem\u003c/a\u003e (855 bytes)",
