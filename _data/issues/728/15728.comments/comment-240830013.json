	"body": "@dperny Thanks for the report. It may be possible to get this error when mixing packages using the old (textual) export format, and the new (binary) export format. The 1.7 compiler tries to be compatible to two export formats, and perhaps that's not a good idea. Maybe it should just flat-out  reject packages using the old format. Then users would simply be prompted to recompile their packages.",
