	"body": "I find it confusing that the `gzip.Writer.Flush()` method doesn't actually flush the compressed data to the underlying buffer.\r\nI'm running: `go version go1.6.1 darwin/amd64`\r\n\r\nHere is the code: https://play.golang.org/p/zXIh2ZL5Cs \r\n\r\nI was expecting the number of written bytes after flushing and after closing the writer to be the same but that is not the case.\r\n\r\nAlso calling `Flush()` multiple times results in more data being written to the underlying buffer than it was written to the gzip writer – https://play.golang.org/p/ochlIkK6KS – is this expected behavior or is it a bug?\r\n\r\n",
