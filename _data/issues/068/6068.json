	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Visit \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/EfOOCquXd3\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/EfOOCquXd3\u003c/a\u003e\n2. Change your browser's width until the lines wrap\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe first line should have line number 1, the second line should have line number 2.\nWord wrapping should not affect the numbering, and \u0026quot;fake\u0026quot; lines should have no\nown line numbers.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nDepending on your browser's width, line 1 will span multiple lines and affect future\nline numbers.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nn/a\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nChromium Version 26.0.1410.43 (189671) on Gentoo Linux\nFirefox 17.0.3 on Gentoo Linux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nn/a\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nIt'd be easy to dismiss this issue because Go code shouldn't be so ridiculously wide,\nbut when inlining XML or JSON this issue can actually arise a lot easier.\u003c/pre\u003e",
