In certain cases, it still offers\naccess to underlying OS specific features in the interests of being a useful system\nprogramming language (look at os.FileInfo.Sys() for example). Filesystem event\nnotification looks to present enough cross platform differences to warrant some\nexploration in that direction.\n\nDon't get me wrong, fsnotify is great stuff, I just think inclusion of it or something\nlike it could use a little back and forth :)\n\nAt the minimum, refactoring it to only register with the underlying APIs for the user\nrequested event mask instead of all supported events, and cleaning up the various data\nraces that have been fixed or identified in the exp inotify/winfsnotify packages seems\nprudent.\u003c/pre\u003e",
