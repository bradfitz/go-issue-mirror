Please correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\n* With `internal/` packages, tools like guru, godoc, and even the go command can *technically* make use of fsnotify or @rjeczalik's notify without needing a public API in standard library or x/. \r\n* Fsnotify will remain under a BSD license (3-clause or 2-clause), but perhaps there is a caveat with the CLA situation if it is a non-Google project? (the Google CLA is still requested at this time, but not enforced)\r\n* In time, we will hopefully have a way to ensure that (foundational) libraries like fsnotify and grpc-go run everywhere that Go does. #17312\r\n\r\nIf anyone reading this has the bandwidth and interest in file system notifications, you are certainly welcome to contribute as much or little as you like over at https://github.com/fsnotify. Thanks.",
