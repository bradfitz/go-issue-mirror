This means you can't see configuration files modified by many\ntypes of text editor which use the atomicity of a rename to wholly update the file on\nsave.\n\nThis seems like one of the primary use cases of fsnotify for which it unfortunately\ndoesn't currently work.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/howeyc/fsnotify/issues/15\"\u003ehttps://github.com/howeyc/fsnotify/issues/15\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
