	"body": "SSA has different behavior from the previous backend, and some tests probe this behavior.\r\nIn some cases this can be repaired by changes to SSA (i.e., it does the same thing, but doesn't log it or logs it differently) and in other cases SSA just plain does things differently (for example, it removes nil checks very aggressively and so the nil checks emitted do not match).  To allow the tests to run successfully with SSA both enabled and disabled, some of them must be disabled until this is resolved.\r\n\r\nAffected tests:\r\n```\r\nlive.go\r\nlive2.go\r\nnilcheck.go\r\nnilptr3.go\r\nsliceopt.go\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://golang.org/cl/16299",
