	"body": "What @adg said is correct. The behavior of gzip flushing is necessary for the correct operation of some network protocols. Not only does Flush ensure all buffered data has been flushed to the wire, it also writes a special synchronization message (really just an empty raw block) for the recipient to know that such a flushing event had occurred. There's an entire unit test in `compress/flate` just to lock this behavior in.\r\n\r\nJust to confirm though, Flush does indeed ensure *all* the buffered data has hit the underlying io.Writer.\r\n\r\nI can document this.",
