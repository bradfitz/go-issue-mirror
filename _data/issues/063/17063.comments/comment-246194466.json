Inf, NaN, -0 are all generatable from builtin operations eg / (divide)\r\n\r\nAs IEEE 754 (single and double) is supported by core spec, so, there's an argument that NaN, Inf, -0 should also be supported by the core spec - ie **should be in _builtin_** (https://golang.org/pkg/builtin)\r\n\r\nok that's a big ask, with a world of naming issues for code already written.. Nevertheless I think it makes some good sense - so I should bring it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
