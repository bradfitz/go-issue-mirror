What do you see instead?\nSince this is a demonstration for multithreading i expect to use the two\ncores of my CPU and show \u0026gt;100% in top. Instead I see one core fully\nutilized the other one idle.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux/amd64\n\nWhich revision are you sync'ed to?  (hg log -l 1)\n3975:b51fd2d6c160\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
