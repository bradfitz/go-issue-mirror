IPv6 and IPv4 (eg forward the former to local port N and latter to M), if we disregard the IP address, we won't know how to route an incoming connection.\r\n\r\nHowever, we could add a bugfix mode to the code,  by disregarding the IP check for specific version strings. To do this, we need to know exactly which server version strings exhibit this problem",
