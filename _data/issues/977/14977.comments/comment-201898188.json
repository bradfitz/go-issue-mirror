Your example (which is great and I just learned from it and gonna impl it for #8899), it'd have to be copied around, also it wouldn't work for non-pointer types for CAS.\r\n3. One of the main selling points of go is the amazing concurrency, adding general atomic support would be a nice addition.\r\n\r\nOne more thing, It doesn't really have to be a keyword, it can be a type, for example `n := atomic.ValueTo(Node{0})`, just trying to get a general impl for Swap/CAS.",
