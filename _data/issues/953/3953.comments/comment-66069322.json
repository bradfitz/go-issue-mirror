More precisely, it is the syntax accepted by RE2 and\ndescribed at \u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax\"\u003ehttp://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax\u003c/a\u003e, except for \\C.\n\n...\n\nIf 'Submatch' is present, the return value is a slice identifying the successive\nsubmatches of the expression. Submatches are matches of parenthesized subexpressions\nwithin the regular expression, numbered from left to right in order of opening\nparenthesis. Submatch 0 is the match of the entire expression, submatch 1 the match of\nthe first parenthesized subexpression, and so on.\u003c/pre\u003e",
