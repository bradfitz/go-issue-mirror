Removing the non implemented fields, maybe?\n\n2(and most important)- I had a hard time finding that what it's called 'numbered groups'\nin one doc is referred as 'submatches' in the other. Maybe just adding 'numbered groups'\nsomewhere indicating that it's an equivalent term may help.\n\nFor the second point I must say that when I'm programming I tend to use the search\nfeature of my browser a lot ... if I don't find 'group' or 'numbered' in the spec I\nassume it's not here. Is this wrong? Maybe, but I'm not the only one doing this ...\u003c/pre\u003e",
