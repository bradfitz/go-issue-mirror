Comments that shows up in documentation? Any godoc text (probably\nnot). Something else?\n2) When does a package exist? When it's in the std lib? Somewhere else?\n\nThere already is a mechanism to highlight individual words in documentation comments,\nfor instance to connect the documentation to parameter names in the documented function\nor method. That machinery is not used yet. It could be modified to do a bit more.\u003c/pre\u003e",
