It won't and it can't and it shouldn't.\nFor example, if there's bufio in between, all structure of the\nmessages will be destroyed.\n\nThe intent here is to document what the clients of the Reader\ninterface need to know so that the properties of the interface - a\nbyte stream, no more, no less - hold. The only open issue was the\nmeaning of (0, nil) not being defined in the documents. Since it's a\nbyte stream, the meaning should be no-op, and that is being\ndocumented.\u003c/pre\u003e",
