An advantage to allowing it is that it allows occasional (0, nil)\nmid-stream, maybe easing the implementation of Readers (like our crypto/tls.*Reader,\nwhich can sometimes return (0, nil)).\n\nThe disadvantage to treating it like EOF is that we then have THREE WAYS to do EOF, and\nall callers have to deal with all three ways. The current two is onerous enough.\n\nI recommend documenting it as a semantic no-op, but discouraged (especially repeatedly)\nbecause it's useless and can only harm performance.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **go1.1**._",
