	"body": "`git push` does not care about the directory under `GOPATH` in which a local repository sits. How to push changes upstream is irrelevant. The overhead for cloning a repo into the right place is a one-time cost (maybe per machine, but trivial nonetheless); alternatively, if the repo was fetched with `go get` into the right place, it is a single command in Git (and presumably Mercurial) to declare how to push things upstream.\r\n\r\nYou're throwing up more red herrings. If the hosting site changes then developers will need to change their configuration regardless, and that's an event that doesn't happen often.",
