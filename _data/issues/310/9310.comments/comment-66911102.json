I don't want to change how vanity import paths work, but when canonical paths are enforced.\r\n\r\nFor the user (terminology above) the current behavior is perfectly fine.\r\nBut since the developer can't push to \"gopkg.in/metakeule/loop.v1\"\r\nhe will have to manually clone or add an external.\r\n\r\nBut that is not the point, since you would have to manually clone anyway.\r\nThe point is however, that you have to do this for every version and that all tools that\r\nrely on a package path (e.g. editor, IDE, yadda yadda) also have to switch the path.\r\n\r\nFor some of them symlinks might work, but since the go commands don't support symlinks you are out of luck if any of the tools use the go commands.\r\n\r\nThat are not red herrings but so many different consequences that are problematic.",
