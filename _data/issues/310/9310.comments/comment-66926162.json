If an enforcement can\nbe easily circumvented, then that enforcement is no use at all. This is\nsimilar to the question of adding a flag to make unused variable/import a\nwarning rather than an error, and the answer is the same: no.\n\nForking and vendering needs to update the import paths and import comments,\nand that's not a problem at all.",
