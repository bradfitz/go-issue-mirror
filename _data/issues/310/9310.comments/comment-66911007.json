It is very confusing.\r\n\r\nI am not ignoring \"for N versions you end up with N working/developing copies\", but you have not stated why that is a problem. If you are using N versions, you'll need N copies so that `go build` can work. How can you get any fewer copies?\r\n\r\nThe argument against your proposal is that it is proposing to add a completely useless flag. You haven't actually identified a problem with the current way of doing things. You seem to be unhappy that your `GOPATH`-based package path is different to the upstream Git URL, but that's the whole point of vanity import paths. Either use vanity import paths how they are designed to be used, or don't use them. You seem to want a third option.",
