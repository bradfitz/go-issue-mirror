It is very confusing.\r\n\r\nYes, sorry\r\n\r\n\u003e If you are using N versions, you'll need N copies so that go build can work. How can you get any fewer copies?\r\n\r\nIt is very simple. I only get the copies that I use **as user** (i.e. from another package of mine) but\r\nI can develop on as much versions as I want inside a single working copy (via branches and tags).\r\nFor any new version I just change the canonical path and add a tag.\r\n",
