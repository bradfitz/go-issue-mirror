	"body": "Using `gomobile bind` I'm able to build my go package into a framework for iOS. I would like to do this for OSX as well. I tried working around `gomobile` and creating a library using just `go build` but I get warnings that `-linkshared is only supported on linux/amd64`. Also tried setting ARCH and OS flags, didn't seem to affect `gomobile`.\r\n\r\nI would like to put together a script that compiles both frameworks at once. Is such a thing possible using just `gomobile`? Can I build the library on linux and move it to OSX?",
