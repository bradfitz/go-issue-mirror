I'll double check tomorrow that this still\nproduces the segfault we saw initially, because I can't reproduce it on a virtual server\nI have here. It might depend on how many cores you have whether you see this segfault. I\nthink it's important to run it as a test instead of as a command on its own.\n\nAlso, here's more fun which looks like a signal handling bug.\n\nChange sixteen_test.go -\u003e sixteen.go and change the test function to func main().\n\nNow do:\n\nwhile true; do GOMAXPROCS=16 ./main ; done\n\nNow randomly press Ctrl-C a few times. I see lots of segfaults (probably unrelated to\nthe original report), I'm guessing in the signal handling code.\u003c/pre\u003e",
