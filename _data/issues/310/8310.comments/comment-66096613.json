We want to make it possible to write a moving garbage collector, but that means that\nthe garbage collector has to be able to change all pointers.  The GC won't be able to\nsee pointers stored in C code.  So we can't permit that.\n\nTo pass a pointer into C and get it back you will have to do something like use a\nmap[uintptr]*X.  When you want to pass the pointer down, convert to uintptr and store\nthe pointer in the map.  When you get it back, use the map to get the real Go pointer.\u003c/pre\u003e",
