But I don't see how your proposal helps with original issue\nraised by rsc:\n\nvar x C.T\nC.f(\u0026x)\n\nWhat will you do here?\n\nAlso, there is still issue of Go objects been moved by GC. For example, in windows net\npackage we pass Go buffers (just like in #8) to kernel. The syscall returns immediately,\nwhile kernel proceed to write to passed buffer. We keep pointer to buffer in Go, until\nkernel finished writing (just like your proposal suggests). But that approach will fail,\nif GC will move the buffer.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
