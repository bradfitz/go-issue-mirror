	"body": "@griesemer, this issue is not to argue the \"a == b\" should return true, it argues to remvoe this line \"Two named types are identical if their type names originate in the same TypeSpec.\" from go spec.\r\n\r\nThe reason is, if what you says is ture, that means there is no ways to define identical named types in Golang. then, this line \"Two named types are identical if their type names originate in the same TypeSpec\" in go spec is meaningless, and gives people the impression that it is possible to define custom identical named types, this is bad.\r\n\r\nBTW, if you intend to use the discussion thread to continue discussion, please make a comment there to revive that discussion, thanks. I mean, you should provide an example that two identical custom named types originate in the same TypeSpec. Otherwise, you should give a reason why this line  \"Two named types are identical if their type names originate in the same TypeSpec\" should keep staying in the go spec.",
