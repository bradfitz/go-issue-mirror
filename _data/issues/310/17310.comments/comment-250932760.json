	"body": "This is not a bug: You are declaring two types X (same names) but they are declared in different functions (so you can use the same name without conflict), and thus also different places in the code (and thus different TypeSpecs - or more wordly, different pieces of source code text following the syntax of a TypeSpec). Thus these two X's represent different types. Consequently, when two values of different types X are compared via an interface, the types don't match and thus the result is false. Please continue using the discussion thread if this doesn't make sense to you. Thanks.",
