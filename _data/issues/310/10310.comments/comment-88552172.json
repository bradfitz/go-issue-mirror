	"body": "The go tool is not inherently target-specific.  You will have to build a version of the go tool for your build system, and use that go tool with your cross-compiler.  For example, you can set the GCCGO environment variable to tell the go tool which compiler to use when building.  Building the go tool as part of gccgo is quite new, and it is likely that you will run into trouble.  Please report specific problems that you discover as specific issues.  Thanks.",
