	"body": "This proposal does not necessarily have to wait for 2.0.  We can not remove methods from `reflect.Type`, but we can add them.\r\n\r\nThat said, I do not understand your web framework example.  Struct tags let us convey information that is separate from the type, which is useful when the same type is used in many different ways.  A web framework that supports different authentication mechanisms could do so through the type anyhow.  It doesn't need an additional mechanism.  The types passed into a web framework are unlikely to be used in any other way, so requiring them to be a specific type doesn't seem a significant hardship.\r\n\r\nAlso, adding tags to a type requires you to have a specific type.  If you have to have a specific type anyhow, adding a method doesn't seem like a big deal.  Tags would be somewhat more concise, but they don't seem to provide any functionality that is not already available.  If there were a way to put a tag on a specific instance of an existing type, that would be a different matter--that is what field tags let you do--but it doesn't seem to be what you are proposing.",
