In the thread \"[golang-nuts] Simplification of\nMIPS cross-compilation?\" Dave Cheney revealed that you have to build the go-tool using\ngccgo to get a version that supports the same target architectures that (a\ncross-compiling) gccgo supports. The problem with current versions of the packages\n(tested today with tip of the repos) (versions attached below!) is that some code has to\nbe out-commented to pass the compilation (as mentioned in the golang-nuts thread) and\nthat compilation with the produced xgo-binary ends with the 'unknown ptrSize for $GOARCH\n\"mips\"' error.\n\nWhat is unclear though about the problem is if the go/src/cmd/cgo tool also has to be\ncompiled with gccgo producing a xcgo in the same manner like xgo? I assumed so when\nposting this issue based on the output from $(xgo build -compiler -x ...) showing that\nthe command complaining about the pointer size is cgo.\n\n\nWhether or not cgo also should be compiled with gccgo this issue is still valid as of\ntoday, since xgo can not be compiled without commenting out code. But it would be nice\nto know if cgo has to be compiled using gccgo libraries too. Anyone know? \n\nping {iant, cheney}\n\n\n\nVersions I used today (tip of repos):\n\n$ go version\ngo version devel +e426bfa69c19 Fri Apr 04 08:42:35 2014 +0200 + linux/amd64\n\n$ gccgo -v\nUsing built-in specs.\nCOLLECT_GCC=gccgo\nCOLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/home/erikwp/bin/gccgo/libexec/gcc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/4.9.0/lto-wrapper\nTarget: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nConfigured with: ../configure --prefix=/home/erikwp/bin/gccgo --enable-languages=c,c++,go\nThread model: posix\ngcc version 4.9.0 20140307 (experimental) (GCC)\n\n$ mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu-gccgo -v\nUsing built-in specs.\nCOLLECT_GCC=./mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu-gccgo\nCOLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/home/erikwp/src/mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu_gcc_build_newest/tools/libexec/gcc/mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu/4.9.0/lto-wrapper\nTarget: mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu\nConfigured with:\n/home/erikwp/src/mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu_gcc_build_newest/src/gccgo/configure\n--prefix=/home/erikwp/src/mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu_gcc_build_newest/tools\n--target=mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu --build=amd64-linux-gnu --host=amd64-linux-gnu\n--with-sysroot=/home/erikwp/src/mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu_gcc_build_newest/sysroot\n--enable-languages=c,c++,go --disable-libssp --disable-libgomp --disable-libmudflap\n--disable-libquadmath --disable-libquadmath-support --with-pkgversion='erikwp'\\''s\nmipsel-unknown-linux-gnu GCC phase3 crosscompiler' --with-ppl=no --with-isl=no\n--with-cloog=no --with-libelf=no\nThread model: posix\ngcc version 4.9.0 20140307 (experimental) (erikwp's mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu GCC phase3\ncrosscompiler)\u003c/pre\u003e",
