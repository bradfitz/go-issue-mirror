I hope this is in the spec\nbut haven't checked. That explains the gc behavior you saw.\n\nIt is true that we are a bit fuzzy about 'representable'. I interpret\nit to mean that rounding is okay but completely out of range values\nare not (i.e. 1e500 is not representable: it does not round to 1e308\nnor does it round to +inf).\u003c/pre\u003e",
