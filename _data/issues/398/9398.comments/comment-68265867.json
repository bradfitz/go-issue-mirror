	"body": "Based on the recent ndk's logging (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/liblog/logd_write.c), I guess logs need to be sent through /dev/socket/logdw (unix domain socket).\r\n\r\nThe runtime at tip directly writes logs or print messages to /dev/log/main (https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/master/src/runtime/print1_write_android.go)\r\nBut /dev/log/... are no longer accessible(?) or used in android-L. Is it possible to use ndk's __android_log_write from the runtime package? __android_log_write handles emulator environment too. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, we need to make runtime use /dev/socket/logdw. I don't know android enough to know if it's backwards compatible. ",
