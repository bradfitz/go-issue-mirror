	"body": "So, two interesting developments. The original problem that had me going down this direction was fixed by simply `go get -u golang.org/x/mobile` since I hadn't done that in a while. Turns out it had to do with returning `nil` as `error`.\r\n\r\nMy main function is something like this with the panic. Since I commented out the other code, I assume this is the important part.\r\n\r\n    func Run(port int, dataDir string, version string, platform string) error {\r\n       panic(\"Hello, world.\")\r\n       return nil\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUpdating the mobile repository certainly fixed the issue with defer-recover, and it now prints panics to stdout. The bare panic, however, doesn't print to logcat. I have confirmed that `print1_write_android.go` exists.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `log` and `fmt` are working normally.",
