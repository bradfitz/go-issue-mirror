If another \nthread, running concurrently, makes a call that relies on buf and related values being\nconsistent, then the result \nis garbage.\n\nI agree that the writer is \"usually\" safe, but not always. That's why my example program\nhad to run some \n100,000 concurrent calls to find a few dozen examples of garbage in the buffer.\n\n\"Usually safe\" is not safe.,,,\u003c/pre\u003e",
