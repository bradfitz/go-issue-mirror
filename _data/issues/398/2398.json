	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIt is quite common to have text formats where the last part is a multi-word string. For\nexample we might have a file of IDs, salaries, and names:\n\n200 350.50 John Doe\\n\n202 375.25 Jane Doe\\n\n\nI don't think that lines like these can be handled by the fmt.Scan*() functions. But if\n\u0026quot;%*s\u0026quot; was allowed as the very last format in a format string we could do:\n\nvar (\n    id int\n    salary float64\n    name string\n)\nfmt.Sscanf(line, \u0026quot;%d %f %*s\u0026quot;, \u0026amp;id, \u0026amp;salary, \u0026amp;name)\n\nJust an idea:-)\u003c/pre\u003e",
