	"body": "A function to copy a `tls.Config` should probably be exposed in 1.8 because `net/http` could use it. Also, the current `DialWithDialer` function copies the config in order to set an SNI value, but that has a complex interaction if the `Config` is being used for serving. Maybe that's an unreasonable use-case but, if so, what's reasonable could be better documented.",
