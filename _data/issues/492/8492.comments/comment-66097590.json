Also if tested, then it should be\ntested for all platforms, although it's less likely it's incorrect on other platforms.\nAlso, adding a call to nslookup would slow the tests down.\n\nCurrently I simply replaced the LookupNS(\"gmail.com\") test with\nLookupNS(\"www.golang.com\"). I believe it should be sufficient, but if not, I can add\nmore comprehensive tests.\u003c/pre\u003e",
