	"body": "So I think in the cases where we need to play nicely with arbitrary C code:\r\n\r\n  - syscall's {Clear,Get,Put,Set}env and Environ functions should all treat C as the source of truth for the environment, rather than keeping a local copy of the environment to manipulate and just trying to copy mutations to C.  (E.g., even today, if cgo code calls setenv, it won't be visible to os.Getenv; whereas os.Setenv is visible to getenv.)\r\n\r\n  - package runtime should use getauxval for accessing the aux value array, to avoid needing to locate the array in memory.\r\n\r\nThat would just leave needing to figure out a solution for os.Args.  It would kinda suck, but maybe we could just leave it nil in the case where Go isn't acting as the program's entry point?",
