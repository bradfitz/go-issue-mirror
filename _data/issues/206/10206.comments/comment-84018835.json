	"body": "Rather unsatisfactorily, I rebooted the android device. The os/exec test passes in 2.2s now (instead of 22s). It is also failing to fail on TestPipeLookPathLeak.\r\n\r\nAs the test itself includes a time.Sleep loop, I suspect the device simply became slow enough to make the test flaky.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear why the device became flaky. It was a couple of months since a reboot, but top showed no active processes and ps didn't reveal any cruft. None of the temporary directories appeared to be full. \r\n\r\nKeeping the issue open for now just in case some evidence appears.",
