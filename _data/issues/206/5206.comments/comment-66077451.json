I was \"copying\" SafeStore,\nwhich copied the Mutex it contained. \n\nI eliminated that and the error is gone. \n\nI'm not sure why it works with Go 1.0.3, or why it hung and proceeded after introducing\nUgorji bool, but it is a programmer error.\n\nThanks much for your help narrowing this down.\u003c/pre\u003e",
