I only see it when\nrun within my application.\n\nSorry if I sound hasty - have to rush off for my niece baseball game. Hope this \ngives you something to start with.\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5206/14/safe_store.go__04052013_104845.bak.go\"\u003esafe_store.go__04052013_104845.bak.go\u003c/a\u003e (7003 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5206/14/golang-issue-5206.txt\"\u003egolang-issue-5206.txt\u003c/a\u003e (18658 bytes)",
