I sent\na CL years ago—one that I'd like to eventually revise—with the\nintention of completely stripping out all the Unix compatibility\nstuff from the Plan 9 syscall package. It was put there early in\nthe life of the port only for expediency and should be removed.\n\nThis is unrelated to the issue at hand, though, so if you want\nto discuss it more we should probably move to the mailing list.\u003c/pre\u003e",
