	"body": "@ianlancetaylor @bradfitz Hi, by \"varying the build path\" I mean we are doing the first build in `/build-1st` and the second build in `/build-2nd`, and the resulting binaries contain differences.\r\n\r\n[Example diff](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/rb-pkg/unstable/amd64/diffoscope-results/golang-goprotobuf.html) and a list of [things we vary](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_variations.html).\r\n\r\nI originally thought to open a new bug, because this bug seems to be about cgo and $WORK. We have also experienced this cgo issue elsewhere which we document [here](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/issues/unstable/random_build_path_by_golang_compiler_issue.html), but the issue I described with `.gopclntab` is different.\r\n",
