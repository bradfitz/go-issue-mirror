That means that the node implements and enables IPv6 node functionality, and probably some software components along L3-L2 host transmission/reception packet path inside the kernel (such as packet filter, protocol/address family translator blah blah) discard test packets.\r\n\r\nFor now I have no plan to make existing test cases more adaptive for helping such case.\r\n\r\n@jacobsa,\r\n\r\nLooks like mbuf stuff on latest darwin kernels sometimes requires a warmup. Please check the output of \"netstat -is, netstat -s and netstat -m\" when you have a fail.",
