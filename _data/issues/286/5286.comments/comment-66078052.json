The issue happens when you are logged in\nas root (not just an admin-rights user) via GUI and then work from a terminal, or via\nssh with 0 as effective UID. Instructions to enable/disable root user are here:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11331\"\u003ehttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH11331\u003c/a\u003e\n\nOn the other hand, I will have a clean slate system on Wednesday, June 5th and will try\nit there, to make sure there is no interference with something installed on the current\nsystem.\u003c/pre\u003e",
