	"body": "Note that we're unlikely to issue 1.5.5 for this (Go 1.5 is unsupported except for critical security fixes, and this is a non-security problem in an unreleased piece of software). Even if Docker is using 1.5.4, it seems like it should be possible (trivial even) for the Windows Nano Server build to use 1.5.3. Again, Go 1.5 is not supported (see https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy).\r\n\r\nI'm also somewhat skeptical of including a fix in 1.6.2, since again this is an unreleased piece of software, there is a plausible workaround (use 1.5.3 or 1.6), the functionality works fine on standard Windows, and it sounds like Windows Nano Server might fix the missing functionality before its official release. Especially since we now understand this section to be a security-critical part of the code, letting the fix work through the standard major release process for Go 1.7 seems preferable than rushing in a last-minute change.",
