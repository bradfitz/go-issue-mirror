	"body": "Sorry for the long delay. Obviously we've missed the Go 1.6.2 window, and probably the Go 1.7 window.  However, we've figured out how to fix this in Windows, so I'm closing this issue. Thanks again for everyone's help.\r\n\r\nIt did occur to me while looking at this that there is very little reason for Go to load shell32.dll to begin with. With some small changes we can eliminate that and at least one other DLL; this has the advantage of significantly improving the launch performance of Go processes on Windows. I will open a separate issue for that soon and provide some fixes I've prepared.",
