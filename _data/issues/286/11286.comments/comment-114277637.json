	"body": "The reason for the SIGILL is that the b.tophash[i] on hashmap.go:446 constructs and attempts to dereference a non-canonical address. We're not yet sure where that bad address came from.\r\n\r\nOne suspicious thing, if lldb is to be believed, is that in mapassign1, t.typ.gcdata is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...}. kindGCProg is set, and this is not a reasonable GC program. t should be the type structure of the map[string]struct{} type. So, we may be building bad GC bitmaps, or corrupting them.\r\n\r\nCheckmark mode does not complain and the test still fails with gcstoptheworld=1 and with gcstackbarrieroff=1. It does *not* fail with GOGC=0. All of this, as well as the bisect result, is consistent with bad bitmaps (but not the only possible explanation, of course).",
