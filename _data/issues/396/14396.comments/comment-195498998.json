	"body": "I repeated the kubemark test with Go 1.6.0 on top of current master and it passes. Both pod latency and API call latency are considered OK by the test. The API latency is higher than what I was seeing before, but the test also does a different set of operations than it used to, which could easily affect the overall distribution in either direction. I am running 1.6.0 and 1.4.2 a bunch of times to gather actual statistics. But at least if kubemark is the bar then it looks like Go 1.6.0 is acceptable. I'll have more about 1.4.2 vs 1.6.0 on the current kubemark master after the weekend. Still using your GCE project.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I noticed that recent changes to the build process mean that 'make quick-release' assumes it has write access to gcr.io/google_containers. I patched around it (rsc/kubernetes@f6dc8f6) but it seems like a potential mistake waiting to happen, especially since there's nothing forcing build/build-image/cross/Dockerfile and build/build-image/cross/VERSION to stay in sync. It's easy to imagine someone updating Dockerfile and forgetting to update VERSION and thereby accidentally replacing, say, kube-cross:v1.4.2-1 with an image using Go 1.6. Or maybe I misunderstand and they are immutable? Regardless, it also makes it harder for non-k8s engineers like me to run tests.",
