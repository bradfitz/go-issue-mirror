How do I find the history of a Dockerfile image's tag?\r\n\r\nThere's this tag-history page: https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/debian/tag-details.md#debianjessieWhich has history:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/docker-library/docs/commits/master/debian/tag-details.md\r\n\r\nThe commits updating debian:jessie can be found by cloning https://github.com/docker-library/docs.git and looking at e.g. `git log -L 97,132:debian/tag-details.md` \r\n\r\nIt appears there were updates on:\r\n\r\nMar 27 2015\r\n....\r\n.... missing history\r\n....\r\nSep 07 2015\r\nOct 22 2015\r\nNov 09 2015\r\nNov 14 2015\r\nNov 20 2015\r\nDec 04 2015\r\nJan 06 2016\r\nJan 25 2016\r\nFeb 16 2016\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it looks like the bot updating the tag history didn't begin life until `Wed Sep 9 11:31:58 2015 -0700` when Tianon Gravi first ran it, before \"Docker Library Bot\" took over.\r\n\r\nSo \"golang:1.4.3\" (updated on Sep 23, 2015) was built with a known \"debian:jessie\" hash, but I can't figure out what \"golang:1.4.2\" was built with. Maybe @jfrazelle can help me do archaeology.\r\n",
