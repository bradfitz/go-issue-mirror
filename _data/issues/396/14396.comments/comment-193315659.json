See the commits on Sep 21, 2005: https://github.com/golang/go/commits/release-branch.go1.4\r\n\r\ncb65428710d70abdaf101defa9cd7eaddff9d925 seems unlikely. It only affects error paths.\r\n8f3395902d3f57887dd11b60d837785107304df4 blocks multiple HTTP Content-Length headers. I doubt you were depending on that.\r\n8f429671248bbcf956fa8a1b7c3a1072285a3b8b is about HTTP header field names with spaces in them. I doubt you were using those.\r\ne938de22be4ee63d65152024f75d62482d3d69b4 fixed #10135 but if you hit that, you would be panicing, not getting slower.\r\n\r\nSo, I suspect either your Kubernetes benchmarks are bogus (or at best noisy and statistically useless), or something else changes in between benchmarking Go 1.4.2 and Go 1.4.3: machine types? GCE zone? Kubernetes rev itself?\r\n\r\nWere you ever able to reliably reproduce the purported Go 1.4.2 to Go 1.4.3 performance regression with all else being equal, or was this the result of two sole data points? And if the latter, how far apart in time were those two data points?",
