	"body": "There's no way at the moment to use `Import` or `ImportDir` to select all the files in package ignoring build constraints. There is the `Package.IgnoredGoFiles` field, but that does not extend to finding the dependencies of the ignored files, and so requires extra parsing steps.\r\n\r\nOne use case for this is in situations like App Engine: we want to select all the source files for an app, but not exclude source file that would be needed to compile a package in other/future versions of Go. So, we want to select files ignoring any go1.x tags.\r\n\r\n/cc @dsymonds @adg ",
