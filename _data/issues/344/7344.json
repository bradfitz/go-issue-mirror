It helps move things along if you change run.go to\ndo the GOGC=0 itself (debug.SetGCPercent(0); runtime.GC()) so that it is not inherited\nby the things being run.\n\nThis appears to be something being freed too early. I have not debugged it beyond that.\n\nA bug to fix for Go 1.3\u003c/pre\u003e",
