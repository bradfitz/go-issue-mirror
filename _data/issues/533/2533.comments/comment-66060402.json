The GOARM=5 binary should be\nsoftfp and run fine on the emulated ARM926EJ, as indeed it does for dcheney.  If it\nreally\ndoesn't, something's up with the GOARM=5 build as rsc says.\n\nBut setting GOARM=_9_ (as in the OP) isn't going to be softfp: it will be VFPv3 and fail\non the\nemulated armv5 hardware.  The \"5\" in GOARM=5 is presumably an ISA (architecture) version,\nnot a chip family.\n\nIn which case, perhaps my previous comment could be charitably interpreted as a\nsuggestion\nto allow Go to target ARMv6 architectures without giving up hardware fp. Pre-Cortex\nhardware is still potentially interesting - Raspberry Pi is an ARM11, for example.\n\nApologies for the noise.\u003c/pre\u003e",
