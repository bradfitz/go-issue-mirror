It will crash if you don't\ngive cgo anything it recognizes as a go file.\n\nAnd I've also noticed that just my original measure isn't sufficient when trying to\nintegrate with a out-of-source build build system where the easiest path is to keep\ngenerated files in a separate tree than the original source. So I'm attaching a\nsecond path that makes is so you can also specify the destination directory for the\ngenerated files with an environment variable.  ie:\n\n    CGOUTDIR=/some/destination cgo -I.. /some/source/dir/something.go\n\nI used an environment variable because it was easy, and did't require making a major\nchange in how cgo handles the command line.  I don't care what the mechanism is as\nlong as there's a way to do it.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/533/2/cgo2.patch\"\u003ecgo2.patch\u003c/a\u003e (4407 bytes)",
