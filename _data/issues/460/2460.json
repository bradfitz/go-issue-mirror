	"body": "by **sebastien.paolacci**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Set a small, but large enough for sending few bytes, write timeout.\n2. Send a large buffer that can't be sent in one single pass.\n3. Make client's receive loop fast enough to respect timeout, but not to respect (number\nof chunks x timeout).\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nFull buffer sent, no timeout.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nTimeout.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nlinux/amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nr60.3,tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nCurrent Write implementation handles partial writes, which make it really suitable for\nturn-key high level calls like io.Copy{N}, but considers timeout as being a global\ndeadline whatever the amount of data being transferred.\n\nShould applications have to deal with significantly heterogeneous transfer sizes,\ntimeout setting must be adjusted on a per call basis to reflect the more usual \u0026quot;min\nbandwidth / max inactivity\u0026quot; concept.\n\nReceiving large chunks takes longer than small ones but this doesn't provides with any\nadditional information regarding peer's status/health which timeouts are (mostly) useful\nfor.\n\nThere's a golang-nuts thread dedicated to that issue, Russ was hesitating between\ndeleting the timeout support and making the timeout reset on each byte sent, let's hope\nthe later is going to win;)\n\u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/500f3b0e9eed3811/\"\u003ehttp://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/500f3b0e9eed3811/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
