	"body": "The `os/exec` package currently only supports mapping `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` objects to `Stdin`, `Stdout`, and `Stderr`. It would be nice if `Cmd` supported adding additional readers and writers for other file descriptors. For example, I would like to have FFmpeg split an Ogg stream from `Stdin` into two separate `io.Writer`s (one assigned to `Stdout` and the other on FD 3). I can do this by creating my own pipe and spinning up a goroutine to do the `io.Copy`, but that functionality is already built into `os/exec`. It just needs to be exposed in the public API. Perhaps something like:\r\n\r\n    cmd := exec.Command(...)\r\n    f, _ := cmd.WriterDescriptor(w) // or cmd.ReaderDescriptor(r)\r\n    cmd.ExtraFiles = append(cmd.ExtraFiles, f)",
