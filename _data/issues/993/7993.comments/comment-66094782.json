Perhaps this change wasn't strictly necessary but it did resolve\na few bugs I was banging my head against the wall with.\n\nPlease see my work here: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/JamesDunne/go-util/tree/master/imaging/gif\"\u003ehttps://github.com/JamesDunne/go-util/tree/master/imaging/gif\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIf anything, it could serve as a baseline for correcting the standard image/gif\nimplementation. I have tested it extensively on my own library of animated GIFs so I\nknow it's good.\u003c/pre\u003e",
