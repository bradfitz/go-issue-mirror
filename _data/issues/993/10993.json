	"body": "This is extremely annoying and it's made me cry numerous times.\r\n\r\n### Information\r\n\u003chr\u003e\r\n**Go Version:** go1.4.2 darwin/amd64\r\n**Operating System:** Mac OS X 10.10.3\r\n**Processor:** 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n### The Problem\r\n\u003chr\u003e\r\nSo recently, I've been trying to install Go. I've been able to install it correctly with the .pkg installer ([go1.4.2.darwin-amd64-osx10.8.pkg](https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.4.2.darwin-amd64-osx10.8.pkg)). After that, I attempt to correctly set $GOPATH and configure my $PATH to include $GOPATH. This is were I'm having trouble.\r\n\r\nI've been using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCsL89YtqCs) to set up Go along with [this page](http://golang.org/doc/install). After following those instructions, my $GOPATH and $PATH are correctly configured. Yay!\r\n\r\nHowever, if I exit out of Terminal or open a new terminal window, everything is reset. My $PATH gets reset back to before it was configured, just after the .pkg installer installed Go and my $GOPATH is reset nothing (it's blank). Basically after configuring $GOPATH and $PATH, exiting out of Terminal will revert these changes.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n### Overall Question\r\n\u003chr\u003e\r\nIs there anyway these can be permanently set? Because I'm new to Go and I'm getting very annoyed at this, especially since my first project is using an external package that I can't work on, test, or use if my $PATH keeps resetting itself.\r\n\r\nP.S. Isn't it possible for the .pkg installer to just use a simple shell script to automatically set the $GOPATH and configure the users $PATH?",
