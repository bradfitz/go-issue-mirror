It seems that if\nthe struct contains a string (even if not used) AND the struct is accessed using the\nvalue, compilation uses a lot of memory and the program produced is really big or even\nfails to compile. \n\nThe program in playground uses about 100 MB of RAM to compile and the binary is 54 MB.\n\nRemoving the string (or replacing it by an array of ints, for example) or removing the\nsecond for range loop, will solve the problem.\u003c/pre\u003e",
