If there are some parts of  the  specified\r\n  address  range that are not mapped, the Linux version of madvise() ignores\r\n them and applies the call to the rest (but returns ENOMEM from the system\r\n call, as it should).\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we saw that it happens in reality, then I guess we need to fix it.\r\nHowever, mmap/munmap with unaligned size are OK, don't touch them. Also don't change _PageSize and don't use it outside of heap code. _PhysPageSize is what you need.\r\n",
