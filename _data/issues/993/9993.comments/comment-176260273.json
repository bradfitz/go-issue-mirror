On arm64 devices this issue means that the Go GC will increasingly own memory within an iOS (and presumably Android) process and never give it back, which can eventually get to the point where the memory available to the rest of the process is too small to run normal operations and OS will kill the app due to memory pressure.\r\n\r\nMore discussion here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/-7ehtvFzJj0\r\n\r\nThanks!",
