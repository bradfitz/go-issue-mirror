I think this might be a duplicate of \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/8368\"\u003eissue #8368\u003c/a\u003e, which was fixed by\nrevision 0015a25415455c390ae135bef7de2d5e2b10ee88.  I'd appreciate if you could repeat\nyour testing against Go tip and let me know if you're still able to reproduce the\nintermittent panics.\n\nIf so, it would be helpful if you could attach the output of running \"gcc -E\" against\nyour Cgo preamble so we can try to reproduce the issue on non-FreeBSD.  Also if you\ncould try to minimize the test case.  I'd suspect the root cause was the\nLIST_HEAD/LIST_ENTRY macros.\u003c/pre\u003e",
