If I get one, I'll post the results, and if you have one, please just stick the sources from the tgz into $GOPATH/src/app and run `go run main.go` to see if the error occurs with you.\r\n\r\nBut, my sanity check here tells me that you shouldn't be so suspicious, `go env` reports `/go` (same as $GOPATH in bash), sources don't reference some `/other` or `../other` locations. I might be quite new at this, but I'm pretty sure that nowhere in about 10-20 lines of code I'm going _outside_ of GOPATH, and I'm not touching it in any way. The obvious question is \"what's the correct way to set up GOPATH?\" if the official docker image doesn't do this. Source Dockerfile is here, if you can spot the issue: https://github.com/docker-library/golang/blob/master/1.6/Dockerfile\r\n\r\nI'll attach my results if I can get my hands on on a local install of go somewhere.",
