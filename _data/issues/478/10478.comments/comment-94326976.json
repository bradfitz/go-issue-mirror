	"body": "@rsc I agree that \"go run\" and \"go build\" need to be made internal-aware.  It's certainly a bug that \"go run $GOPATH/src/foo/x.go\" currently works even if foo/x.go imports internal packages from the standard library like net/http/internal.\r\n\r\nIt's just not obvious to me that \"go run $GOROOT/src/net/http/x.go\" should fail if net/http/x.go imports net/http/internal, because it would complicate some seemingly reasonable use cases for mixing \"internal\" and \"go generate\".\r\n\r\nA simple concrete proposal would be that if the files passed to \"go build\" or \"go run\" are all within the same directory, then they should be allowed to import internal packages just as normal package code within that same directory could.  For example, $GOROOT/src/net/http/x.go could import net/http/internal, but not $GOROOT/src/cmd/internal/gc.\r\n\r\nThe proposal could be extended to files spread across multiple directories too, but I'm not sure there's a need.",
