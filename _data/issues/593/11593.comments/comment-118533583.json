The _ identifier is a valid identifier everywhere a name is declared (as in a label declaration), but _ is never entered into a scope and thus is never defined/declared. Thus it doesn't \"exist\" and cannot be used or found as being unused. Very much like _ variables are valid and the compiler does not complain if they are not used.\r\n",
