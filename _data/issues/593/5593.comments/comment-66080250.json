If I\nmodify the finaliser attached to each os.File to complain if it is being called, ie, if\nthe os.File has fallen out of scope without a call to Close() and stress test this\npackage eventually I find a stray os.File (attached to a tcp connection) which is\nprobably what this test is also discovering.\n\nAt this point I haven't figured out where we are leaking the os.File (or net.Conn)\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-soon**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to @davecheney._",
