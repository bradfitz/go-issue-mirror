	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWe have a bunch of race-related copy-paste in sync, sync/atomic, net, syscall, runtime.\nMoreover, any race-related functionality requires 2 files -- race.go and norace.go -- as\nrace functions are not provided by runtime in non-race build.\n\nWe can create internal/race package and move things like IsEnabled, Acquire, Release to\nit. It will remove the copy-paste and all the additional files from other packages.\n\nAdditionally then we will be able to easily exclude or tune tests in race mode using\nrace.IsEnabled. E.g. now we have the cpuprof test that constantly flakes on\nfreebsd-amd64-race.\u003c/pre\u003e",
