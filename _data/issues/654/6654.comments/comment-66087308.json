Remember\nthat most people will go install godoc just because they want the latest version of\ngoodc, and would expect it to replace their existing version of godoc.\n\nTrying to think of a way to make this more obvious. A warning is one answer, and maybe\nthe right one. If that's the case, we should do it for the other tools (vet, cover) that\nget installed to $GOROOT/pkg/tool/.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-soon**, **go1.2maybe**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
