More so than `\u0026` at least. Using colon has the property that it doesn't already mean something in markdown, and it is very unlikely to have been used in slides to mean anything. (It's conceivable but unlikely someone might have started a line with `\u0026`, though.)\r\n\r\nI too apologize for bike shedding. ",
