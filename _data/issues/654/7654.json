	"body": "by **marko@kevac.org**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThis bug is in all go versions (including tip).\n\nIt is impossible to Seek() in bytes.Reader to offset higher than 2^32 because of the\ncheck inside Seek() implementation.\n\nThis check is not needed IMHO. Latest Go versions allow slices with length larger than\n2^32.\n\nPatch would be very simple. Just remove check from Seek() implementation.\u003c/pre\u003e",
