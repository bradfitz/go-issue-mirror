Note: there is no need to\nuse the same architecture name as others (gcc/llvm/binutils)\ndo because gc is a completely separate toolchain.\n\nwe are not talking about the chip here, so i don't think\npeople will confuse it with IBM's microarchitecture (plus\nwe are not even close to Power32/Power64 now)\n\nand btw, power64 is not a trademark, but powerpc is.\u003c/pre\u003e",
