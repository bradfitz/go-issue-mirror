Allowing bytes.Reader to accommodate buffers greater than or\nequal to 1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;31 (not 2^32, btw) will enable writing programs which would run on 8\nbyte int archs but would not run on architectures having only 4 byte ints. Also, for\nexample Reader's Len would have no way how to return a correct value in some cases on\nsuch archs. IOW, this cannot be changed, AFAICT.\n\n#WAI\u003c/pre\u003e",
