I know that the same\nproblem exists for _ = slice[1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;33], but I think such code should discouraged by\nthe stdlib. Also a 2GB buffer is big enough for anything I can imagine. The purpose of\nbuffer is not to accommodate _all_ data but to make processing the data faster when\ninterleaved I/O and processing is the bottleneck. The improvement often happens with\nbuffers as small as only few kB. Then the law of diminishing results inevitably steps in\nand huge buffers can even make things slower wrt to latency of some initial result data\nbeing produced.\u003c/pre\u003e",
