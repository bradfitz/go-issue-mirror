	"body": "I propose adding support for presenter notes in the Go present tool.\r\n\r\nMotivation: Go present is great. I used Go present at the recent GopherCon India and wished there was support for presenter notes. Having a presenter tool, with Go present, can make presentations a lot smoother and calm the presenter's nerves. Presenters don't have to use alternatives with presenter options if they want to use Go present. Best of both worlds.\r\n\r\nDemo: http://virtivia.com:27080/1vs4fiwjm924q.mov\r\n\r\nAn implementation: https://github.com/audreylim/go-presenter#readme \r\n\r\nIf this proposal is accepted, I can submit a CL with the changes I've done for further review.\r\n\r\nEDIT: [here](https://github.com/audreylim/go-presenter/compare/6d2d6fe87af7948f2e44ea75fdbe2d39418cc3ad...master) are the changes ",
