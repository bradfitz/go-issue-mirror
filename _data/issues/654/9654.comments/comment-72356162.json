	"body": "I think the obvious behaviour would be to give the caller a copy of the Addr. After looking at the code I think the only way to do this is to give Addr the ability to copy itself. However, we can't change the Addr interface, so I think introducing an interface like\r\n\r\n    type AddrCopier interface{\r\n      func Copy() Addr\r\n    }\r\n\r\nmight work around the problem. Make all the net.(.*)Addr types implement this function and let LocalAddr() (and probably RemoteAddr() as well) check if the given Addr also implements AddrCopier. If so, return a copy. If not, return the original value, because that's all we got.\r\n\r\nI know this isn't a real fix, but I think it's the only solution.\r\n",
