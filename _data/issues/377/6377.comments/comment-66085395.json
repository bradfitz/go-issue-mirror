The\nconnection becomes useless after receiving a Pong frame because of the frame not being\nfully junked away.\n\nI did a test by sending a PingFrame from the server and just waited until a Pong was\nreceived from the browser:\n  conn.PayloadTyhpe = websocket.PingFrame\n  _, err = conn.Write([]byte(\"ping\")\u003c/pre\u003e",
