	"body": "Thanks. You are right. Setting CGO_CFLAGS corrects the compiler flag\nproblem. There is just one problem remaining...\n\nThe resulting code does not run because it is trying to use the wrong\ndynamic linker. It is trying to use /lib/ld-linux.so.3 which does not exist\non our target. For the ARMv7 it should be using /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3. I\ncan skirt the issue in one of two ways. I can hack the code in\nsrc/cmd/link/internal/arm/obj.go to point to /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 or I\ncan create a symlink between /lib/ld-linux.so.3 on the target to\n/lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3. Either allows the program to run. Is there more\ncorrect way to get Go to use the correct loader?\n\n\n\n*Greg Strange*\nSoftware Engineering Program Lead\nSynapse Product Development\n\nmail 1511 6th Ave Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98101\ndirect 206-832-1269 ext. 3505 \u003c206-832-1269,3505\u003e | office 206-381-0898 |\nmobile 206-240-5605\ngreg@synapse.com | http://www.synapse.com\n\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential.
