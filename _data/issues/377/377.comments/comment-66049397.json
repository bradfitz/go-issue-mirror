In principle I agree with his argument that it would reduce the\npotential for a certain class of subtle errors.  The question is whether this\npotential benefit is worth introducing a 'special case' into the spec and eventually\ninto all go compiler implementations.  Since much is being made by go promoters about\nit being a 'safe' language I'm leaning towards agreement with OP, ie. no shadows of\nreturn parameters.  I realize this isn't a democracy, it's just my opinion FWIW  :-)\u003c/pre\u003e",
