	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1) What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\nLatest master 1.7.\r\n\r\n2) What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nn/a, but darwin/linux amd64.\r\n\r\n3) What did you do?\r\n\r\nI originally tried to use `go tool trace` in 1.6:\r\n- found that the bundled catapult trace viewer was so old as to need [a deprecated experimental browser api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/observe)\r\n- followed the thread from [`misc/trace/README.md`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.6/misc/trace/README.md)\r\n- after copying in a newer trace viewer bundle, it turned out that the api had shifted so much that the inline javascript was now broken\r\n\r\nFrom there I started hacking on my copy of the go 1.6 source, eventually I got a hold of the 1.7 source and found that at least all of the assets had already been upgraded (now including a polyfill for the ill-fated Object.observe).\r\n\r\nHowever the future surface area fur such drift had only increased since 1.6; compare:\r\n- before: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.6/src/cmd/trace/trace.go#L51\r\n- after: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/trace/trace.go#L50\r\n\r\nThis is truly unfortunate since the only dynamic part of that entire \"template\" is a URL parameter for the XHR request to load data.\r\n\r\n4) What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nPrincipled separation between frontend code and server-side code.\r\n\r\n5) What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nA hardcoded html+javascript \"template\" (not even an [html/template](https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/)\r\n\r\nI have a proposed change that I'm working to get into [Gerrit](https://go.googlesource.com) now.",
