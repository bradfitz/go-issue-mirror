	"body": "by **aicommander**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n0. Open a WebSocket which will be connected to Internet Explorer 11\n1. Call WebSocket.Receive() without providing any data to receive\n2. Wait 30 seconds or so for the Receive() call to fail\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nWebSocket.Receive() should continue to wait after receiving a pong.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nWebSocket.Receive() returns ErrNotImplemented when it gets an unsolicited pong from IE\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows 8.1 with IE 11\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nGo 1.1.2 Windows/AMD64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThis behavior does not adhere to RFC 6455 Section 5.5.3 which explicitly mentions that\nbrowsers are allowed to send unsolicited pongs.\n\n\u0026quot;A Pong frame MAY be sent unsolicited.  This serves as a unidirectional heartbeat. \nA response to an unsolicited Pong frame is not expected.\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e",
