I reported once which was closed https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13448. After that actually I found there are many of them too. Another example will be [this](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/textproto/reader.go#L480), why must return? why not finish all first? and return everything that you find good as well as the error - some special error to indicate there are still some useful data. User of this library can then decide whether to ignore the error or not and take whatever good.\r\n\r\nI understand this is not some kind error but the fact is the Golang stdlib returning nil or insufficient data once it encounters error (some avoidable or recoverable errors) forced me to move away from stdlib because the need to create compatible email client as Thunderbird using Golang. Still, I believe Golang can do better.",
