What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n    GOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\n    GOBIN=\"\"\r\n    GOEXE=\"\"\r\n    GOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\n    GOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\n    GOOS=\"linux\"\r\n    GOPATH=\"/home/enzoc/App/go_path\"\r\n    GORACE=\"\"\r\n    GOROOT=\"/home/enzoc/.local/share/umake/go/go-lang\"\r\n    GOTOOLDIR=\"/home/enzoc/.local/share/umake/go/go-lang/pkg/tool/linux_amd64\"\r\n    GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\"1\"\r\n    CC=\"gcc\"\r\n    GOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0\"\r\n    CXX=\"g++\"\r\n    CGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nMy environment:\r\n\r\nproject directory:   /home/enzoc/tmp/GoLang/emacs_setup_test   (/home/enzoc/tmp is a symbolic to /opt/enzoc/tmp)\r\ngo file directory:    /home/enzoc/tmp/GoLang/emacs_setup_test/src/cmd/helloworld/t.go\r\n\r\nThe Emacs \"go-mode\" would automatic set my GOPATH to /opt/enzoc/tmp/GoLang/emacs_setup_test (true directory). When I call the \"go-rename\", it forms the \"-offset=%s\" with buffer name as \"/home/enzoc/tmp/GoLang/emacs_setup_test/src/cmd/helloworld/t.go\" which doesn't match with the GOPATH. Then I go \"Can't find package contains ...\" error.\r\n\r\nI tried from terminal to set both GOPATH and \"-offset=\" file name to true directory and file name, it works well. \r\n\r\nSo I guess, if \"go-rename.el\" can make both the GOPATH and buffer name use the true file name or directory name, that issue should be solved. \r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nI would like to see both GOPATH and --offset is set with true directory or file name as:\r\n    \r\n    GOPATH=/opt/enzoc/tmp/GoLang/emacs_setup_test/\r\n    --offset=/opt/enzoc/tmp/GoLang/emacs_setup_test/src/cmd/helloworld/t.go:XXX\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nBut what I saw is:\r\n    GOPATH=/opt/enzoc/tmp/GoLang/emacs_setup_test/\r\n    --offset=/home/enzoc/tmp/GoLang/emacs_setup_test/src/cmd/helloworld/t.go:XXX\r\n\r\nThat causes \"gorename\" return error as \"Can't find package contains ...\".\r\n\r\n",
