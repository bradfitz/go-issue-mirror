My source is at:\n\nchangeset:   6764:03404c0155f6                \ntag:         tip                              \nuser:        Robert Griesemer \u0026lt;gri@golang.org\u0026gt;\ndate:        Fri Nov 12 16:39:33 2010 -0800   \nsummary:     token/position: implemented Pos  \n\nPerhaps goinstall can't overwrite some files it is trying to install, because they are\nin use by another program or read only or something. I suggest, you could just put\ncouple of fmt.Printf() statements to see which file / dir is at fault, or, perhaps,\nthere is a bug we need to fix. Goinstall is not a big program, so it shouldn't be hard\nat all. Thank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-windows**._\n\n_Owner changed to @alexbrainman._\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
