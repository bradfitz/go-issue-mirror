(past execution of git)\n\nI wonder if this could be be related to issues I have with godag and gobuild.  even\nthough 8g is executed properly, runs fine given the command lines passed, and exits with\ncode 0, those build tools implode with 'access denied' (exit with code 1) before running\n8l if I do not run from within a cygwin sh environment.\n\nI'm guessing this must have to do with use of linux-specific os features (pipes?), since\nProcMon[1] doesn't show any attempted file activity failing at the time of program\ntermination.\n\nAlex, are you using a VM, Cygwin, msys, unix services for windows, or some other interop\nsoftware that you'd like to share about for reliably working with go on windows?  Is\nthere a tutorial for proper environment setup that I missed somewhere?\n\n\n[1] \u003ca href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx\"\u003ehttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
