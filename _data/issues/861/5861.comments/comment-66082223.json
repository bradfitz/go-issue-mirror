Maybe also \"list *0x4121b3\". That value is\nthe rip printed by the SIGSEGV. It is possible that goroutine 10 was the\none that faulted, since it's the only one listed as running, but then again\nit might not have been.\n\nI don't know of a tutorial for reading go stack traces. The running\ngoroutine is supposed to be first but was not at the time you copied tip\n(nor in Go 1.1 I fear). I've fixed that at current tip, although current\ntip has other problems and I wouldn't trust it for production use. (In fact\nI wouldn't trust most tips. I'd stick with 1.1. But I appreciate the report\nnonetheless.)\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
