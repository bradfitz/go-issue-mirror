	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCL 148470043 will introduce code that causes the runtime to crash if the garbage\ncollector sees an invalid pointer. Because we believe that everything is precise, a\ncrash in this code indicates a bug: either the collector has freed something it should\nnot have, or something that looks like a pointer is being scanned conservatively, or\nsomething is creating invalid pointers.\n\nThis should help shake out latent bugs in the runtime during the release freeze.\n\nIt is not yet clear to me whether we should keep this code in the actual release. This\nissue is to decide between:\n\n1) Leave crash.\n2) Make crash on-by-default but disabled by a GODEBUG setting.\n3) Remove crash, ignoring invalid pointer.\n\nWe can make the decision based on how much we see the crashes.\u003c/pre\u003e",
