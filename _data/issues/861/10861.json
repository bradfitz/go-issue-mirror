	"body": "I came across this golang-nuts thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-dev/r4rdPdsH1Fg/yjOOzqIqNPMJ\r\n\r\nThe issue is that comments used as directives for the compiler and tools (such as // +build, //go:generate, etc.) really aren't human-readable *comments*. A different syntax (such as //! or #) would make the intent more clear.\r\n\r\nIn the thread, Brad Fitzpatrick said `Remember that suggestion for when Go2 planning happens and propose it then. Nothing's changing here until then.`, so I'm putting this in the issue tracker so it doesn't get forgotten.\r\n\r\n(P.S. Please add the go2 label to this issue.)",
