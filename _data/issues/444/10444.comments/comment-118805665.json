I still haven't decided which way I fall here.\r\n\r\n\"package touch\" and \"package lifecycle\" would let you say \"touch.Event\" and \"lifecycle.Event\", but also \"touch.SequenceID\" and \"lifecycle.Stage\" instead of \"event.TouchSequenceID\" and \"event.LifecycleStage\", so while these event/foo packages will be small, they won't all be nothing but a trivial \"type Event struct{ etc }\". A \"package key\" certainly won't be trivial if we add names for all the buttons like Backspace, plus modifier masks.\r\n\r\nAs for the name \"draw\", there's already an \"image/draw\" package in the standard library, so it may make sense to rename the event from \"draw\" to \"paint\" (or another bikeshed color).",
