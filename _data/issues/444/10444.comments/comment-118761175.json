But if we create a new package for each event type, we will suffer from the pollution of sub-packages under x/mobile/event. And unfortunately these sub-packages will have to be named after very commonly used words such as touch and draw. It might be a wiser choice to preserve these names for functionality exposed around touch and draw, rather than just exporting event types.",
