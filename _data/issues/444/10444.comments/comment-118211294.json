	"body": "The x/mobile/event package has changed since this issue was first opened. Its package doc comment currently says, \"This package defines a number of commonly used events... other packages may define their own events\".\r\n\r\nOther packages include things like what's currently x/mobile/exp/sensor (and third party packages outside of x/mobile), so a 'sensor event' type doesn't necessarily need to live in \"package event\": the qualified type name could be \"sensor.Event\" instead of \"event.Sensor\".\r\n\r\nGiven that, it might make sense to break up the x/mobile/event packages to push 'core event' types like event.Touch and event.Draw into x/mobile/event/touch and x/mobile/event/draw so that the type's qualified names are \"touch.Event\" and \"draw.Event\", consistent with third party \"foo.Event\". I am already in favor of a separate x/mobile/event/key package so you can say things like \"key.Backspace\" and \"key.AudioVolumeUp\", so it might make sense to have \"key.Event\" too.\r\n\r\nOTOH it does mean that the x/mobile/event/draw package will literally be:\r\n\r\npackage draw\r\ntype Event struct{}\r\n\r\nplus commentary, which hardly seems worth its own package, but it still might make sense for consistency.\r\n\r\nI don't know which way I prefer yet. WDYT?",
