Our setup is a bit complicated, because have a proxy in the middle, so the flow is client -\u003e proxy -\u003e backend (and it ultimately connects to a Docker exec session). I was able to hack the proxy to get it to somewhat support proxying HTTP/2, and I was able to successfully round trip a request from the client to the backend and back. The one thing I didn't get working was interactive input and the output coming back immediately. I'm not sure if it's an issue with the way I was trying to proxy the request through, or what, but I'll come back to it at some point in my spare time.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate what wasn't working correctly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl exec -i nginx bash\u003cCR\u003e\r\nls\u003cCR\u003e\r\ndate\u003cCR\u003e\r\nexit\u003cCR\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output from `ls` and `date` only show up after you type `exit` and hit enter. So the round trip isn't completing until the backend exec completes. I think given your demonstration of the echo client/server working, there is something wrong in my setup...",
