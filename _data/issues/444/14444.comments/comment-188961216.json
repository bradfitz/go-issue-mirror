	"body": "https://golang.org/cl/18978 introduced changes that fixed the errors appearing earlier then these, so it did not break anything.\r\nThe issue here is that `go get -u all` is trying to update commands too. The commands cache was not clearing and their packages were not rebuilt using new packages cache for imports. That led to duplicated standard packages in the `packageList` and that's why we were getting these errors. I've added command cache clearing and test for that into https://golang.org/cl/19899",
