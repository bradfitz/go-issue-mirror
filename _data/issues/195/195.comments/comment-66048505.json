I was also \nconfused about the semantics for \"%+v\" when the field to be formatted has a String\nmethod on it's type. I \napologize for misleading you into thinking that there was a bug in \"print.go\".\n\nOne of the reasons I nested my Color data structure with values and not pointers was\nbecause I looked at the \nsource code to Printf and saw that it will chase nested structures (nice feature) but\nnot nested pointers \n(makes sense, I saw the comment).\n\nI have two follow-ups to this issue. One will be a request to consider changing the\nsematics of \"%+v\" when \nthe field to be formatted has a String method on it's type. I assume I should open a new\nissue for that?\n\nThe other will be some thoughts on the interactions between String methods, the printing\nof nested data \nstructures, defining String methods on values vs pointers, and efficiency vs coding\nstyle. I will definely open a \nnew issue for that one assuming I even decide to move forward with writing it up.\n\nThanks and sorry again for the misdirection.\u003c/pre\u003e",
