	"body": "RFC 6265[1] allows cookie values to be double-quoted[2].  However, the current sanitization code strips the double quotes out of a double-quoted value (i.e., a value beginning with a double quote and ending with a double quote).  Ironically, the sanitization code double quotes a value if it begins or ends with a space or comma.  The RFC grammar specification allowing the surrounding double quotes is also included in the comments of the sanitizeCookieValue() function.\r\n\r\nThe inability to double-quote a cookie value is preventing me from duplicating the behavior of a legacy Java system I am replacing.\r\n\r\nThere was some tangentially related conversation for https://github.com/golang/go/issues/7243, but that conversation did not address this issue specifically.\r\n\r\n[1] http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265\r\n[2] cookie-value = *cookie-octet / ( DQUOTE *cookie-octet DQUOTE )",
