I am OK with this being closed and I can set the HTTP headers directly like you said.\r\n\r\nJust for my own understanding, though, if you don't mind:\r\n\r\n\u003e A cookie value may NOT contain a double quote. It even says so:\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e  cookie-octet      = %x21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-3A / %x3C-5B / %x5D-7E\r\n\u003e                        ; US-ASCII characters excluding CTLs,\r\n\u003e                        ; whitespace DQUOTE, comma, semicolon,\r\n\u003e                        ; and backslash\r\n\r\nBut you're referencing the cookie-octet here.  There is also a cookie-value specification; this is what I was assuming should be allowed int he Value field for a cookie:\r\n\r\n`cookie-value      = *cookie-octet / ( DQUOTE *cookie-octet DQUOTE )`\r\n\r\nAm I misreading the RFC?  Misunderstanding what Go's Cookie.Value field represents?",
