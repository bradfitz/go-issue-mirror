It even says so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n cookie-octet      = %x21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-3A / %x3C-5B / %x5D-7E\r\n                       ; US-ASCII characters excluding CTLs,\r\n                       ; whitespace DQUOTE, comma, semicolon,\r\n                       ; and backslash\r\n```\r\n\r\nA double quote is only encode the value of a cookie when necessary. (like it starting with a space)\r\n\r\n\u003e The inability to double-quote a cookie value is preventing me from duplicating the behavior of a\r\n\u003e legacy Java system I am replacing.\r\n\r\nPlease describe the problem more.  A client application shouldn't depend on a cookie being written as `foo=bar` vs `foo=\"bar\"`.  If it does, I think it's broken.  You can read/write HTTP headers directly if you need to interoperate with a non-spec-compliant peer.\r\n",
