I'm working on reviving that CL now.\r\n\r\nAlso, ARM can attach conditions to most instructions, not just MOVs. CMOV also has the pitfall that it unconditionally loads the source from memory; it is only the resulting store than is conditional. These are probably good reasons to make this happen after the initial codegen.\r\n\r\n\u003e if you want to work on this issue, please take a look at the predicate function in cmd/5g/peep.go; we might be able to port that to 8g/6g to make use of cmovcc\r\n\r\nThanks! I'll take a look, although if this will all be eclipsed by SSA in 1.6, it might not be worth the effort and risk right now. (I'm worried about the same issue w.r.t. to the SETcc work, but I've already done a lot of the work, so I'll see it through.)\r\n\r\n\u003e totalling 60-70kb reduction in godoc, given we're removing one 32 bit instruction per rule\r\n\r\nPretty awesome.\r\n",
