	"body": "@andlabs @noblehng I don't think that would be (1) backwards compatible and (2) you are creating an ad-hoc API that does two different things.\r\n\r\nIf a current code base calls Next() even after it returns false, it could still work, even if non-optimal. However, with this suggestion it would break. I will grant you it could be considered a bug in the usage. I really think we are doing two logical things.\r\n\r\nI agree just using Next() is possible, I think it is just less optimal.\r\n\r\nI think output parameters support should be included in the named parameter discussion.\r\n\r\nRight, Ii don't want to support MARS or Oracle session multiplexing. I have yet to encounter *any* code in any organization I've encountered use these features. I just want to support sequential multiple result sets.",
