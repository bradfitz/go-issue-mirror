	"body": "The lack of an API in `database/sql` for retrieving multiple results can almost be hacked around at the driver level. Take a look at https://github.com/lib/pq/pull/425 for an example of achieving this in the `lib/pq` postgres driver. This hack is sort of ugly, though, as it relies on the driver recognizing a special SQL statement (`NEXT`) in order to return subsequent results. Besides the ugliness, it is incomplete as it relies on the `NEXT` query being sent to the same `sql/database/driver.Conn` as the original query. This works fine on `Tx` structures, but not for plain calls to `DB.Query` (unless you do some other hack like `DB.SetMaxConns(1)`). ",
