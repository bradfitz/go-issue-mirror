The reason I've suggested this is the fact that Gitter is easy to connect with Github, there're many repos with an \"official gitter button\".\r\n\r\nIt's never bad to have more coverage. More ways of communicating. Creating a room and a button doesn't require anything to maintain, but it allows more people to join in and share with the community. The audience there is huge as well. It's just like organizing meet-ups in different locations of world, though they're actually being organized by a variety of people. Well I could create a channel, but it would be like \"vadimyer/go\" - that's not something people might look for there.\r\n\r\nAs @mholt mentioned, it might be a \"lower level\" or something (I don't quite get it why), but it still a community that counts.\r\n\r\nP.S. Personally I didn't like Slack, I didn't even know it exists. I knew Go has IRC, and I've born in the IRC era, but eh... Gitter is cool. They have a cool button which anyone can insert. And it was easy to connect to it with only Github account. Moreover, searching for \"Go\" there returned nothing, people are lazy todays, they probably need more ways of communicating.\r\n\r\nBut that's only my opinion after all, yeah. Thanks for considering that at least.",
