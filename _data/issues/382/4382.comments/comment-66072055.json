In fact, the\ndocumentation refers to Rob Pike, “Lexical File Names in Plan 9 or Getting Dot-Dot\nRight,” which more or less explains why the documented behavior is incorrect for unix\nsystems, and why \"..\" cannot be collapsed when operating on those path types. Plan9\nchanged their filesystem architecture and redefined the lexical semantics to get around\nthis.\n\nThe documentation conflicts with its own references.\u003c/pre\u003e",
