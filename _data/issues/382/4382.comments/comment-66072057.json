Clean() is a lexical parse of a path and must\nnot interact with any particular filesystem. No one is suggesting otherwise. The summary\nupdate is incorrrect.\n\nThe bug (in both the documentation and the implementation) is that Clean() is improperly\nprocessing the path. A path on a unix system cannot have the /../ sequence removed in\nthis manner, as it results in a non-equivalent path.\n\nThe feature request is not to evaluate symlinks. It is to remove step #3 from both the\ndocumentation of Clean() as well as the implementation. Step 3 applies to plan9 systems,\nbut cannot be applied to unix systems.\n\nI took a look at lib9/cleanname.c -- it appears this code was lifted from plan9 and\nmakes assumptions about the plan9 path handling which are invalid on unix systems. This\nis pretty clearly a problem.\u003c/pre\u003e",
