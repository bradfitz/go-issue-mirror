The\ndocumentation for Clean is very clear about what it does. We cannot change it now, as\nexisting programs may depend on the behavior.\n\nI could see a case for introducing a new version of Clean with a different name that is\nthe same as Clean but without this step:\n//      3. Eliminate each inner .. path name element (the parent directory)\n//         along with the non-.. element that precedes it.\nbut the utility of this would be limited, as filepath's Abs, Rel, Dir, Join all use\nClean internally, so we would need to provide replacements for those too.\u003c/pre\u003e",
