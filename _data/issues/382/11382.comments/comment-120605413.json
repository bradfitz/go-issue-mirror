GOTRACEBACK is read too early in the runtime initialization to allow for gomobile to fiddle with GOTRACEBACK and in any case I believe the aborting behaviour should cover all cases where C owns the process. In any case, GOTRACEBACK=crash behaviour includes GOTRACEBACK=2 behaviour (print runtime functions in tracebacks) which is not what we want here.",
