	"body": "Right now there is no easy cross platform way to output multiple artifacts from multiple packages into a single directory.\r\n\r\nRight now you can do `env GOBIN=bin/ go install cmd/...` on many platforms, but not when cross compiling or on windows.\r\n\r\nSuggesting making `go build -o bin/ pkg1 pkg2` build  both packages into the \"bin\" folder.\r\n\r\n@robpike thinks this would make the meaning different based on if it is a file or directory and suggests using a different flag like \"-odir\". That seems fine however I'm not sure how -o would interact with -odir. If they were forbidden from being set at the same time, I would say they should be the same flag, namely -o.\r\n\r\nReference thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/a1wvIZdnic0\r\n",
