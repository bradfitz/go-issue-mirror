As it is now, the 2nd argument(s) to\nappend must be assignment compatible to the slice (1st argument). If the 1st argument is\n(an untyped) nil, assignment compatibility is meaningless.\n\nOne could add extra rules to make it work, but since one can always use copy in this\ncase, we decided against that.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
