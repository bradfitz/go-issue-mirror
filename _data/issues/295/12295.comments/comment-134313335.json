	"body": "\"Reasonable\" is very subjective. Right now functions behave just like pointers, which includes `%d` showing them in base-10 and `%v` as hex. That is probably what an programmer with a C background would expect, too.\r\n\r\nI do not necessarily mean fmt behavior should change; I'm merely documenting the problems I see more than one person having. This misunderstanding may still be rare, but I've seen more than one person succumb to it; the part that especially tricks them is when they expected to see a number, and can't tell what they're seeing is a completely different kind of a number.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is an alternate route, e.g. via `go vet`, `golint`, etc -- though the new gophers that suffer from this don't know of these tools either! So perhaps the \"right fix\" is play.golang.org integration of `go vet`/`golint`?",
