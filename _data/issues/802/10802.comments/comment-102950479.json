	"body": "We can fix drive letter comparison. But the problem is more general - windows paths are not case sensitive. So, for example, filepath.Rel(`E:\\Projects\\`, `E:\\projects\\src`) will be wrong too. I am not sure it is worth fixing particular case of drive letter. What do you think?\r\n\r\nfilepath.Rel is also broken when we walking from one drive to another. It has no meaning for something like filepath.Rel(`c:\\a\\`, `d:\\a\\b`). I would just avoid using filepath.Rel on windows.\r\n\r\nAlex",
