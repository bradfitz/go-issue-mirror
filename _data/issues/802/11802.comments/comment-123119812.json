In [this](https://github.com/hydrogen18/test-tls/blob/master/common.go#L35) bit of code, however, it looks like the config is built with the client authentication in mind. In ListenAndServeTLS, there is [this](http://golang.org/src/net/http/server.go#L1853) where the configuration is passed in. I could see a function like:\r\n```\r\nhttp.ListenAndServeTLSAuth(\":8080\", nil, \"clientcerts.pem\")\r\n```\r\n... being something that could be useful with little modification needed to add the extra step to specify:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconfig.ClientAuth = tls.RequireAndVerifyClientCert\r\n```",
