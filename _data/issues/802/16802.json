	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.7\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nWindows 2012 amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nCalling UDPConn.ReadMsgUDP on Windows.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nThe function behaves the same as it does on Linux.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nThe function constantly raises error \"not supported on Windows\".\r\n\r\nThe document for this function is not clear that it doesn't run on Windows. It can't be easily figured out through source code as well. \r\n\r\nUDPConn.ReadMsgUDP() -\u003e UDPConn.readMsg() -\u003e fd.readMsg() -\u003e error\r\n\r\nI appreciate if this behavior is documented, either in the function description, or in the bugs section, to avoid some hassle during debugging.",
