You can't prove an exponential run time with a single data point.\nIt's linear in the size of the repetition with a very large constant (derived from the\nsize of the regexp, and the size of that regexp is ~ 1 million).\n\nThat said, IsOnePass - added during the 1.3 cycle - is taking far too long to analyze\nthe regexp and is blowing out the stack. That needs to be fixed for 1.3.\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"regexp\"\n\t\"strings\"\n\t\"time\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tre := regexp.MustCompile(`^(?:x{1,1000}){1,1000}$`)\n\tprintln(\"compiled\")\n\tfor i := 5; i \u0026lt; 5000; i *= 2 {\n\t\ts := strings.Repeat(\"x\", i) + \"y\"\n\t\tt := time.Now()\n\t\tre.FindString(s)\n\t\tfmt.Println(i, time.Since(t))\n\t}\n}\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.3**, removed **release-go1.3maybe**._",
