I am sure many other programs on your\ncomputer issue calls like that and they do not crash. It must be something else that\ntickle that bug in nvLsp64.dll.\n\nIt is not easy to debug someone else program. Espesialy if you do not have source code\nfor it. It is certainly doable, but I have very little expirience. Luckily, you could\nget rid of the program. Hopefully, I would not need your help with that in the future\n:-) But thank you for offer.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Retracted**._",
