	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe package rpc is not compatible with App Engine.\n\nOne of the problems is that the server is designed to keep a persistent connection with\na client, and can't be setup to serve ephemeral individual requests.\n\nOther problem is that the client makes a request using a CONNECT HTTP method, not\nsupported on App Engine.\n\nAnd finally, the request is not available in RPC methods, so you can't get an App Engine\ncontext to do anything useful.\n\nI won't propose a solution because I am not familiar enough with the rpc package, but\nlet's keep it registered.\n\nRelated thread:\n\u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine-go/browse_thread/thread/b90d1cbf49bd8f41\"\u003ehttp://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine-go/browse_thread/thread/b90d1cbf49bd8f41\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
