Is it 2 equivalent\nprocesses, or parent and child?\nIn #19 you've posted debugger thread dump. One process contains several threads, which\nis normal for Go process. But the other one contains only 1 thread, which can't happen\nin a running Go process. Maybe it's a forked-but-not-execed child? Note that SIGABRT in\nsuch process can still print several goroutines (and some of them can be running), but\nthat is just what left in memory from parent.\u003c/pre\u003e",
