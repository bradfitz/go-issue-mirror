I think it being first in the list causes vet to skip over the remaining\nfiles that are in package syscall.\n\nIf I move creds_test.go into a different directory, then running \"go vet syscall\" shows\nme the sockcmsg_unix.go unsafe.Pointer warning.  That would also explain why Russ and\nRob are seeing different behavior on darwin.\u003c/pre\u003e",
