	"body": "by **steven.hartland@multiplay.co.uk**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Using a working CookieJar (not the default blackHoleJar)\n2. Do a request using the client api to a URL that sets a cookie\n3. Do a POST request using the client API for which the above cookie is valid\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe cookie returned from request in #1 should be set for #2\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nNo cookies are set and no call to client.Jar.Cookies(url.URL) for the POST request\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nFreeBSD\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThe attached file is a patch from go1, which fixes this behaviour by delegating the\nmaintenance of cookies to the now client method send which under pins all actions.\n\nThis ensures that every call correctly sends cookies for the request url as well as\nsaving them on response.\n\nThis patch was tested using a work in progress implementation of CookieJar which we'll\nalso look to submit once complete and tested.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3511/0/client.go.patch\"\u003eclient.go.patch\u003c/a\u003e (2101 bytes)",
