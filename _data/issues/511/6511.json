	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIt'd be useful if the playground could run tests -- more like `go test` instead of `go\nrun`.\n\nThis is possible now (\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/K0gFil6jFC)\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/K0gFil6jFC)\u003c/a\u003e, but it's clumsy and\nnon-obvious.\n\nJust to get the conversation started, here's a concrete proposal:\n\n* Tests and examples are supported, but not benchmarks. (Benchmarks are going to\nunreliable anyway, right?)\n* If main is not present and there is an appropriate test function (or example function\nwith output), then the playground executes in test mode. Otherwise, behavior is\nunchanged.\n* \u0026quot;Test mode\u0026quot; is equivalent to `go test -v`.\n* Add text to the About page explaining how to use playground for tests.\u003c/pre\u003e",
