Explicitly crippling 'go run' in this way doesn't feel intuitive to me.\n\nAnd a final quirk - if I move the extra files into a separate module, and thus makes the\nproject as a whole more complex (having to export/import the right parts), 'go run'\nsuddenly works. This seem quite contrary to the argument made.\u003c/pre\u003e",
