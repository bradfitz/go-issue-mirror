I've added various cases, which all (except the\nlast one, which doesn't quite do the deletion) fail to compile.\n\ncheers,\nMiguel\n\nps: and as a side-note... perhaps there's a tiny bit too much typing involved when\ndeleting an element from a map... perhaps = _, false would be better..\n\n----\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n        var k map[string]map[string]string;\n\n        k = make(map[string]map[string]string);\n\n        k[\"a\"] = make(map[string]string);\n\n        k[\"a\"][\"b\"] = \"c\";\n\n        fmt.Printf(\"value is %s\\n\", k[\"a\"][\"b\"]); // all well\n\n        k[\"a\"][\"b\"] = \"\", false; // fine\n\n        _, present := k[\"a\"][\"b\"];\n        fmt.Printf(\"is a,b present? %v\\n\", present); // it's gone, fine\n\n        // k[\"a\"] = nil, false; // fails with: 'cannot use nil as type string'\n\n        // k[\"a\"] = make(map[string]string), false; // maybe like this? not ideal,\nbut.. anyway fails with 'cannot use make(map[string] string) (type map[string]\nstring) as type string'\n\n        // k[\"a\"] = \"\", false; // also fails with: 'cannot use \"\" (type string) as\ntype map[string] string in function argument'\n\n        k[\"a\"] = nil; // fine\n\n        _, present = k[\"a\"];\n        fmt.Printf(\"is present? %v\\n\", present); // doesn't work - as expected -\nleaving element present\n}\u003c/pre\u003e",
