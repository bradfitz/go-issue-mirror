	"body": "I'm implementing my own http2.ConnPool with some health checking done using the new `Ping()` method. My problem is that my pool doesn't have the capability to dispose client connections because there is no way to cleanly close a client connection other than keeping it's `net.Conn` on the side and abruptly close it.\r\n\r\nWhat about adding a `Close()` method `http2.ClientConn` that would send a `GOAWAY` frame and wait for the in-flight streams to complete?\r\n\r\nImplementation proposal: https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/30076/",
