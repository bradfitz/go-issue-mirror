See the report [here](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/9c853bbb54734ddc54c1d57f6315724deb1a3878a3c0ad36b6fdc0e14a7be300/analysis/1467834510/).\r\nLooking further into it, it seems it considers api.exe to contain Trojan.Win32.Ebowla.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a recurring issue. This also happens with version 1.5 with vet.exe and pprof.exe and also a few previously filed  [issues](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+trojan+is%3Aclosed).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
