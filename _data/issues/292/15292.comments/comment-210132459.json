The exciting part of\r\n\u003e the study is that it showed a situation where the use of a\r\n\u003e (stronger) static type system had a negative impact on the\r\n\u003e development time while at the same time the expected bene-\r\n\u003e fit – the reduction of type error fixing time – did not appear.\r\n\u003e We think that such tasks could help in future experiments in\r\n\u003e identifying the impact of type systems.\r\n\r\nI also see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15295 also references [Lightweight, flexible object-oriented generics](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2738008).\r\n\r\nIf we were going to lean on academia to guide the decision I think it would be better to do an up front literature review, and probably decide early if we would weigh empirical studies differently from ones relying on proofs.",
