DeepEqual is often used to compare test results, and if the results contain NaNs, one would have to special-case that situation - it might actually be more useful for NaNs to follow the \"usual\" bitwise equality of floats. Or in other words, DeepEqual perhaps should be defined to return true when comparing two NaNs that are bitwise identical.",
