	"body": "On ubuntu , my app can't reslove the domains that can not be find in the first dns but the second.\r\nIt just happened when I use **golang 1.5.1** . When I use **golang 1.4.*** , it works well .\r\nFor example,I edit /etc/resolve.conf like thisï¼š\r\n```\r\nnameserver 10.27.227.194\r\nnameserver 10.27.227.195\r\n```\r\ndomain **a.com** is defined in **nameserver 10.27.227.194** , and **b.com** is defined in **10.27.227.195** . \r\nThen my application can not connect to **b.com** because of the dns , but it can connet to **a.com** . If I exchange the location of the nameserver ,  **b.com** can be connected but **a.com** can not be.\r\n\r\nThank you. ",
