There might be other\nassumptions of GNU Make elsewhere in the system,\nbut if there is a simple way to root them out I'd\nbe interested to see it.\n\nOpenBSD support will require more than just typing\ngmake but might not be too bad--support for a new OS is\nnot too many lines of code, but you need to be comfortable\nwith low-level details.\n\nGood luck.\n\nClosing per note in comment.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
