This can occur even in cases where Read or ReadMsgIP\n// could return a complete packet. For this reason, it is recommended\n// that you do not uses these methods if it is important to receive a\n// full packet.\n//\n// The Go 1 compatibility guidelines make it impossible for us to\n// change the behavior of these methods; use Read or ReadMsgIP\n// instead.\u003c/pre\u003e",
