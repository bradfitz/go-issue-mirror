I tweaked the\nassembly enough to make it assemble with 5a and the\nresulting binary runs correctly.  I also compiled the\nprogram with 5g and the resulting binary runs correctly.\n\nI have attached the sources I am using and the binaries\nthat I got.  Please try the attached binaries\n(5.s.out, 5.go.out) and see what they print.\nMaybe there is something different between your \nexecution environment (real hw) and mine (qemu, at\nthe moment).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1240/2/x.tar.gz\"\u003ex.tar.gz\u003c/a\u003e (107611 bytes)",
