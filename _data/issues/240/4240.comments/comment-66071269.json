Might just as well do it before\nsending the buffer to gofmt then.\n\nSomething like this in the gofmt defun:\n\n(if (/= (char-after (1- (point-max))) ?\\n) (save-excursion (goto-char (point-max))\n(insert ?\\n)))\n\nThere's really no downside to this solution, and waiting for changes to diff-mode seems\nunjustified.\u003c/pre\u003e",
