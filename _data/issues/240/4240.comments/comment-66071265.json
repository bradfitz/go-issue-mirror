Perhaps go-mode should set this to something like \"visit-save\" for a\nbuffer on which it's going to run the `gofmt' function.\n\nHere's a hacky proposal, within `gofmt':\n\n          (with-current-buffer srcbuf\n+           (set (make-local-variable 'require-final-newline) 'visit-save)\n+           (set-buffer-modified-p t)\n+           (basic-save-buffer)\n\nIn order to ensure that there's a newline at the end of the file, we enable\nrequire-final-newline and force the buffer to be saved. Setting require-final-value like\nthis also ensures that saving this buffer in the future will retain a trailing newline,\nwhich might not be fair. We could bind our preferred value temporarily such that the\nprevious binding is restored after `gofmt' exits.\n\nAlternately, we could just manually check for a newline at the end of the buffer. Even\nbetter would be to teach `diff-apply-hunk' to tolerate the warning about the missing\nnewline.\n\nWell, reading further, when I look in my copy of the file diff-mode.el, I see a note\nfrom revision 1.10 from 1999:\n\n  ;; Revision 1.10  1999/09/30 15:32:11  monnier\n  ;; added support for \"\\ No newline at end of file\".\n\nSome corresponding documentation is here:\n\n  \u003ca href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/diffutils.html#Incomplete-Lines\"\u003ehttp://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/diffutils.html#Incomplete-Lines\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI came away no less confused.\u003c/pre\u003e",
