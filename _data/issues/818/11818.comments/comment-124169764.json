I've considered trying my hand at making a simple GUI toolkit (if it even deserves to be called that), possibly even abstracted over x/mobile and GLFW or similar.  It's way on the back burner at this point, but shiny seems to be in the same spirit.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things that I hope will be at least possible, hopefully easy, and perhaps even baked in.\r\n\r\n- Non-rectangular widgets:  The painted and event-receiving areas (which may or may not be identical) need not be the bounding rectangle of a widget.  I have done this in a double buffered OpenGL application by drawing a \"footprint\" in the back buffer in a color coded to correspond to the widget, for example.\r\n\r\n- Widget-local coordinate system: It sounds like the proposed affine transformations would be post-render.  I would like a natural way for a widget to have it's own extents, origin, (maybe rotation and shear) that apply when rendering to the buffer, as well as the ability to convert to and from other widget, window, and screen coordinate systems.\r\n\r\n- Aspect ratio constraints: A widget may have a fixed aspect ratio and weighted values specifying where to position the widget along the less constrained axis.\r\n\r\nI'm really looking forward to see where this goes.",
