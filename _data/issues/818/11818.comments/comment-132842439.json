For example, on phones, all apps are the equivalent of full screen and don't overlap. For X11, the expose event also tracks whether there are more exposes coming (for non-rectangular exposes), and I intend to just drop all but the last one, and make that last one just trigger a full-window repaint. It seems to work fine in practice, and if it doesn't, then as I said, we can add a Dirty field later.",
