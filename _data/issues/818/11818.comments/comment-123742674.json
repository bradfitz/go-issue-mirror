I don't have a strong sense of exactly what would be shared between them, but, as an example, the OpenGL bindings seem like a common dependency that is neither mobile- nor GUI-specific, but is required by both.\r\n\r\nPut another way, x/mobile is focused on mobile; it needs things like windows and OpenGL, but doesn't (itself) need a GUI toolkit. shiny is focused on GUIs; it needs things like windows and OpenGL, but isn't specific to mobile.",
