You should also look up GDK, because it works really similarly to this (a GdkWindow provides a window system object and you use cairo to draw to it instead of a pixel buffer (even though there are pixel buffers if you want them) but other than that), has been around for 20+ years, and is used in lots and lots and lots of applications, then try to argue that it failed :) And how does Wayland do things differently from Windows, X11, and the OS X window manager anyway? At the end of the day you have a window and a pixel buffer. Also, who are you suggesting is saying duck-typing with interface{} is a good idea? Russ? Rob?!",
