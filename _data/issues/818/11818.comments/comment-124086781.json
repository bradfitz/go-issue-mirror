Wikipedia states that in immediate mode, [in contrast to retained mode, lists of objects to be rendered are not saved by the API library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics)). The whole UI is re-rendered for each update.\r\n\r\nI agree that the underlying implementation can maintain data structures as a kind of cache for optimization purposes. And I agree that an immediate mode API can be built above a retained mode API (this is what React does), and reciprocally.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if this new GUI toolkit for Go could be an opportunity to explore a more \"transient\" API and let the app manage the state, as you wrote at the end of your comment :-)",
