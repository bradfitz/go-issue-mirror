	"body": "Context: https://tour.golang.org/methods/5\r\n\r\n`Package io defines Reader and Writer; you don't have to.`\r\n\r\nThe code in this example does explicitly define Reader and Writer, and the package is \"main\" so it can be run and not \"io\". So, the above line confused me and I'm not sure exactly what's being said. It is saying that normally Reader and Writer are interfaces defined in the \"io\" package which can be imported, but in this code snippet we're showing an example of how to define Reader and Writer ourselves?",
