We need to discuss this further, it would be best to do that when we're not under the crunch of getting a release out the door (that's a good way to make bad decisions), and in any event the people needed for the discussion (at the least, me and Brad) will not be available simultaneously again until September (Brad is away now and I will be away when he returns). There's basically no harm to delaying this one cycle.\r\n\r\nThanks for filing the new issue.",
