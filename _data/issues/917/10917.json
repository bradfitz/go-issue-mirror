	"body": "These commands go through the entire GOPATH changing anything\r\nthat refers to the moved package or renamed symbol.\r\nI see that this would work well in the Google \"one big repository\" world,\r\nbut is never what I want, as the GOPATH is filled with thousands\r\nof packages in different repositories which I do not necessarily have commit\r\nrights to.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it's not really sufficient, as I might not have\r\nall the packages that use the renamed symbol in my import path.\r\n\r\nI'd find gorename much more useful if it could rename within one\r\nrepository only (possibly with an flag to cause it to error if anything\r\nin $GOPATH refers to the renamed symbol), and there was\r\na way to update a package that imports another package that\r\nhas *already* had a symbol renamed (i.e. it is currently\r\nbroken, but renaming the symbol will fix it).\r\n\r\nInstead of gomvpkg, I would find a copy-package utility more useful,\r\nwith the scope strictly limited to the package itself, although\r\ngovers covers most of my needs here.\r\n\r\nSubmitting this as an issue because I'd really like to find these tools useful\r\nbut I have never encountered as situation where I was able to use them,\r\neven though I'm refactoring and renaming all the time.\r\n",
