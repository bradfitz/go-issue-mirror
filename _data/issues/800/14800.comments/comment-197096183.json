The bad case isn't as bad, and tip is slower for me than 1.6.\r\n\r\n| commit | build time |\r\n|-----------|--------|\r\n| 7bc40ff (go1.6) | 3.5s |\r\n| 368507b (parent of 7c18f8c) | 6.7s |\r\n| 5630cb7\t(tip) | 4.4s |\r\n\r\n(These are run with `-gcflags '-ssa=1 -d=ssa/check/off'` where appropriate. Numbers are average of 5 runs.)\r\n\r\nSo tip is still roughly 25% slower than 1.6 for me. I'm on linux/amd64.",
