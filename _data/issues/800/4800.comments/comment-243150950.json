For example, if one uses Reddit API and, having set a unique User-Agent, issues GET requests to, say, https://reddit.com/r/golang/top.json, one will get 429 Too Many Requests most of the time, because reddit.com redirects to www.reddit.com and User-Agent is quietly replaced upon redirect by `Go-http-client/1.1`, which is, being too common, is heavily rate limited. Meanwhile, in Python the same code just works. This isn't exactly what would attract beginners.",
