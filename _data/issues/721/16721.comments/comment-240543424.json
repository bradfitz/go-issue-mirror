We already have to do dynamic checking, so I don't see more dynamic checking as much worse than less - we've already thrown static compile-time guarantees out the window.\r\n\r\nAs for the performance, I was kind of assuming that people more skilled than I am and with better understanding of Go internals would be able to make it much faster :)",
