So I am not fussed about it.\r\n\r\nAs far as the proposal goes, it bothers me to add another function signature that takes interface{} to the standard library. It allows people to argue that we like them, and force people to use them and create them in their own work.\r\n\r\nI do agree that the proposed function will be easy to use, although I'd like to see the implementation and its performance before deciding whether its benefits outweigh its costs.",
