	"body": "@myitcv I understand your point completely. I agree with you that go generate is a great way to solve the problem and that it should be the preferred mechanism of the community. I'm not changing the summary. The pros and cons I listed are for solving this particular problem with code generation in general and cover more than just go generate and editor macros, which are listed as examples of mechanism. Separating the points in the summary adds nothing to the discussion of *this* topic. It just adds additional pros and cons specific to various methods of code generation, which can be discussed elsewhere.",
