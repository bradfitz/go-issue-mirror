I think I'd put the `swap` before `less`, so the `less` literal could span multiple lines, and you could write:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n     sort.Stable(sort.With(len(s), reflect.Swapper(s), func(i, j int) bool {\r\n             if s[i].Foo != s[j].Foo {\r\n                    return s[i].Foo \u003c s[j].Foo\r\n             }\r\n             return s[i].Bar \u003c s[j].Bar\r\n     }))\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`MakeInterface` might be a bit long. I like `With` or `Funcs`, but `len(s)` is not a func)\r\n\r\n",
