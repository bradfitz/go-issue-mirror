If someone can confirm that it in fact does, I'll add it to 2 and/or 6.\r\n\r\nSeparating go generate from an editor macro is just editorializing for go generate, imo: everything that applies to one applies to the other. I mean yes it is great and good, but I am trying to keep that as neutral as it is possible for me  in the interest of discussion.",
