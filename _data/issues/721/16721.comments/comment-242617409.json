	"body": "@praetergeek I'm not sure what your comment about boolean algebra in scalar fields is trying to convey. I understand that it's not exactly equivalent; that's why I made a comment about it. It should be true almost always, but if not for some case then it's easy to fall back to the other method.\r\n\r\nWhy? It's shorter (1 line per field vs 3n-2 lines), easy to understand (it says right there: sort by x then by y), *very* easy to visually parse (they line up until the field name), harder to get wrong (only 2 references to each field vs 4; all the logic is encapsulated in ThenBy), and individual field comparers can be reused if needed.\r\n\r\nBut as @joshlf recommended I think I'll save it for another proposal later if this one is accepted.",
