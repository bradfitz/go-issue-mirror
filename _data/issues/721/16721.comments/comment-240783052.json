Even if it's not changed to a function, the name should change, at least. /bikeshedding (Should I make that comment on the CL/learn how to comment on gerrit?)\r\n\r\n@twotwotwo I don't know if *another* sort package counts as a separate use case :Ã¾. \r\n\r\nA generic permuter was the only other thing I could think of as well. If (New)Swapper goes in, it would be nice to add that to math/rand: save allocating an []int for shuffle. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of algorithms that involve swaps, certainly, but I can't really think of any that *just* use swaps, so there's going to be a lot of `func doThing(slice interface{}, f func(various indicies) retType)` if they do take advantage of (New)Swapper, so this API will proliferate.",
