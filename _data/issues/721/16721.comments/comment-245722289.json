They wanted to wait for @rsc to get back from vacation and chime in.\r\n\r\nBecause the default rejection answer to standard library addition proposals is \"put it elsewhere\", I've preemptively put it elsewhere:\r\n\r\nhttps://godoc.org/go4.org/sort\r\n\r\nThe `go4.org/sort` package is now a pure superset of the standard library `sort` package.\r\n\r\nI figure people can get some experience with the proposal there in the meantime. The reflect-based `Swapper` func creator is at https://godoc.org/go4.org/reflectutil and is used by `go4.org/sort`.\r\n\r\nI still think the standard library should make sorting slices easier and permit writing sort functions inline without declaring a type, though, similar to `http.HandlerFunc`.",
