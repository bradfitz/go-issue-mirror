	"body": "@jimmyfrasche @twotwotwo To clarify something, I think that part of the pain of having to implement custom types is having to clutter up the package-global namespace with them. This probably isn't the place for this discussion, but in my personal experience, I've found myself really wanting to be able to define scope-local types *with methods* to solve this. It makes the difference between getting to use a throwaway, local name (e.g., `sortable`) and having to clutter the package-global namespace with things like `sortableWidgets` or whatever. Also, being able to define types inside of functions *and* have methods on those types would be awesome. It's very possible this has been discussed elsewhere and I'm just not aware of it (@bradfitz might know).",
