In my experience, the headache that Brad referred to in the first comment (which I have definitely felt) stems largely from the namespacing issue. Also, I disagree that this should be Go 2 territory. Supporting methods on local types feels more similar in size to something like being able to use `v.method` as a closure - it would only expand the set of valid Go programs (thus maintaining the Go 1 compatibility guarantee), wouldn't be a particularly big change to the compiler, and wouldn't fundamentally change how any normal tasks are done in Go. \r\n\r\nAnyway, my point is simply that I do think this is relevant here because it's a possible alternative solution (although probably not the best solution proposed so far, I admit).",
