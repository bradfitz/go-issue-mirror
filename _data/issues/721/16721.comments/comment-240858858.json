	"body": "FWIW, I whipped my \"proposal\" up as a tiny package for my own use and my own personal needs are 100% satisfied with this. This basically invalidates the last two motivations given by @bradfitz for my personal taste, as IMHO every project/organization/repo/whatever can just do this themselves if they need or someone can just provide one for general use (perhaps under github.com/pkg). All the usual arguments for living in the stdlib or the x/ repos (wide availability, stability, maintenance…) just don't apply for something this trivial, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThis leaves the repetitiveness of Len and Swap. To that, I personally say ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ and it doesn't justify the downsides of `interface{}` in this instance. And I also believe that the alternatives proposed here (that don't require a language change) just increase the downsides, as they require even more reflection and ignoring the type system and will thus make it even harder to explain to people why go hasn't generics but they also shouldn't roll their own.\r\n\r\nWith that I'll just trust the Powers That Be to do the Right Thing™ and will unsubscribe from this issue to not be tempted to add even more noise :)",
