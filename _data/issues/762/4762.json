	"body": "by **Matthew.Horsnell**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIt may be worth adding an explicit comment in the documentation for sync.WaitGroup that\nthe call to Add should be done before launching the go routine containing the call to\nDone.\n\nYou may never notice this race condition until shipping code, but the call to Add after\nlaunching the go routine may not execute until the go routine completes, which will\ngenerate a runtime panic as the call to Done inside the routine makes the waitgroup\nnegative.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n1. Code like \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/y_6dKky3qX\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/y_6dKky3qX\u003c/a\u003e\n2. May occasionally panic due to the waitgroup becoming negative\u003c/pre\u003e",
