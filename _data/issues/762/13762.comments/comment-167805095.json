In general this may happen when the shared fdMutex in TCPListener is taken by acceptor goroutine prior to TCPListener.Close like the following:\r\n\r\n\u003e - goroutine1: calls netFD.Close. Close sets the state to closed and increments and decrements the ref count, but decref doesn't call netFD.destroy because goroutine2 has a readlock.\r\n\r\nSee #10527 for further information.",
