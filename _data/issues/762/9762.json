	"body": "Test case: http://play.golang.org/p/9oz7e7AKzd\r\n\r\nIn the example above A embeds b which embeds c. There are public functions on b, which is shown correctly in godoc as belonging to A.  However, it seems like godoc only searches 1 level deep, and functions on c are not shown even though they are valid for calls by the compiler.\r\n\r\nReproducible on 1.4.1 and 1.3.3.\r\n\r\nReal life example: [source](https://github.com/klauspost/dawa/blob/master/query.go) / [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/klauspost/dawa#PostnrQuery). A specific query type includes \"geoJSONQuery\" which includes \"query\", and I would like to have the functions on \"query\" to show up. I would however prefer not to expose any of the internal types since they aren't useful themselves.",
