	"body": "This failure happens even in stop-the-world mode, which indicates that there's some root we're not finding on one GC cycle, but we then find the pointer on the next GC cycle (either because we do find the root then, or because the object has been made reachable some other way). In particular, in STW mode, it looks like the object we're missing is being found on the stack in the second cycle.\r\n\r\nOne possible explanation could be that the liveness maps are wrong. If this is the case, this is probably the same bug as #15747 and may have been caused by 3572c64.",
