It did use cgo however, and I'm\n   imagining that's roughly the equivalent.\n   2. Clearly there was an issue with alignment or packing and it was my\n   fault, as I did fix it with more study of the C typedefs in the package I'm\n   wrapping.  Sorry for the trouble.\n   3. It's odd (but conceivable) that the tools would yield differing\n   results depending on whether CPU profiling is enabled.\n\nI must say I've really enjoyed my experience with the language this far,\n\nJeremy\u003c/pre\u003e",
