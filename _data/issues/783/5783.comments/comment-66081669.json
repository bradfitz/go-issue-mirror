As you can see, our table includes\nEnglish only descriptions, while your system returns names in your local language.\n\nI am not sure what to do. We need English zone names for our approach to work. I don't\nsee us adding appropriate strings for every language we find. Not yet anyway.\n\nSo I am trying to find a way to translate these into English in some clever way. The\ntime zone information is stored in the registry. It is stored in\n\"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Time Zones\" key on my\ncomputer (you must use regedit program to access it). You have your non-English strings\nstored there somewhere, but perhaps you have English strings there too (they are not\nexposed via GetTimeZoneInformation api). Perhaps there is enough information there so we\ncould do the translation. Could you, please, send us the contents of\n\"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Time Zones\" key (just\nright click on the key and select \"export\" menu option and save it to a file and post it\nhere. The file will have *all* timezones from your computer. Feel free to email file\nprivately, if you like.\n\nI am opened to any suggestions from everyone.\n\nThank you\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
