I don't like dealing with un packaged blobs and\nit's not easy to follow or understand what go is trying to do. \n\n*)  It would be much better if go came out as go-x.y.z.tar.{gz,bz2,xz} and they untar'ed\nto go-x.y.z.  c.f. python:\n\nwget \u003ca href=\"http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.3/Python-3.3.3.tar.xz\"\u003ehttp://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.3/Python-3.3.3.tar.xz\u003c/a\u003e\ntar tf Python-3.3.3.tar.xz | grep 'Python-3.3.3/README$'\nPython-3.3.3/README\n\nor ruby\n\ntar tf /sw/src/ruby-2.0.0-p247.tar.bz2 | egrep 'ruby-2.0.0-p247/README'\nruby-2.0.0-p247/README.EXT\nruby-2.0.0-p247/README.EXT.ja\nruby-2.0.0-p247/README.ja\nruby-2.0.0-p247/README\n\n*) There really should be an top level INSTALL file that points right to the\ndoc/install-source.html in the source tree.  Cause your install process is not like any\nof the most common ones (autoconf, cmake, scons, etc).\n\nAs someone who builds tons of stuff, when I see something very unusual like \"make.bash\"\nI would normally take that as a signal that I'm going hit all kinds of strange build\nissues.\n\n*) Things like pointing to \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/\u003c/a\u003e  are not winning the hearts and minds of\npeople interested in learning go (well, at least speaking for myself).\u003c/pre\u003e",
