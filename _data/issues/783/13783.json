	"body": "encoding/json: Incorrect slice marshaling for slice of bytes implementing json.Marshaler:\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a type that is based on byte\r\n2. Implement json.Marshaler\r\n3. Create a slice of said byte type\r\n4. Attempt to call json.Marshal on that slice\r\n5. Observe incorrect result, yourtype.MarshalJSON() is never called.\r\n\r\nRepeat with int, works as expected.\r\nUse your original byte type, but put them in a slice of json.Marshaler, works as expected.\r\n\r\nCode showing working cases and non-working case side-by-side: http://play.golang.org/p/5xgjl4e04R\r\n\r\nSystem details: go1.5.1 / amd64",
