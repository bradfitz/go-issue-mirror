	"body": "@josharian #10797 issue is different though it might be hard to understand from the ticket itself.\r\n\r\nCurrently (with Go 1.4) Git repos from git.apache.org are correctly cloned using `git://` schema.\r\n\r\nGo 1.5 treats `git://` as insecure and tries to clone using `https://` by default. However it doesn't resolve the repo URL properly. For example the correct repo URL for `git.apache.org/thrift.git/lib/go/thrift` package should be `https://git.apache.org/thrift.git` while the current code resolves it to `https://git.apache.org/thrift/`.\r\n\r\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/10092/ fixes this problem.",
