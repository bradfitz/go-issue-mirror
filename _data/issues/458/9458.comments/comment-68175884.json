No, it hasn't bitten me in real code (I'm pretty careful about my assumptions about shared buffers because I knew it wasn't strictly guaranteed). I **did** file this because I checked the spec, Effective Go, etc after I realized it and noticed there's no note about capacities not being guaranteed or clarification about the ramifications of that fact.\r\n\r\n(Personally, I'd put a note in a spec, and discuss the ramifications in Effective Go; I'd also have `go vet` catch this where possible)",
