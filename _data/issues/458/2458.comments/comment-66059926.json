I guess sanitizing god received fds, like any other input args, is\nthe only way to get that rigth in the general case. But that's slightly out of topic.\n\nLet's hope that a better timeout api will emerge at a later time. Timeouts are always a\nbit dirty but they're also useful.\n\nThanks,\nSebastien\u003c/pre\u003e",
