I\nwould have suspected the Get/Setsockopt pair being an even more standard use case, like\nin Mikio's SO_REUSEADDR, but you must have much more points in your stat than I have;).\n\nI however feel puzzled by your statement about the uselessness of passing the fd in a\nnon-blocking mode. I'm doing that on a regular basis, by reverting the\nSetNonblock(false), and never (yet) spotted any misbehavior. Did I miss some important\npoint here?\n\nThanks,\nSebastien\u003c/pre\u003e",
