	"body": "CSV is well known for being a format ever program implements somewhat differently, like HTML in the early years of the internet. Yes, the standard says that the quote character is `\"`, but there are many programs out there that expect differently formatted data. Having a CSV package that is flexible in the way it generates output is a very useful thing. I am not sure if suggesting that every program that tries to generate CSV files which do not exactly match the standard shall just fork the `encoding/csv` package is a good idea both in terms of code-reuse and reliability.",
