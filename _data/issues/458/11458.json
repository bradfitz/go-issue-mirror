	"body": "I propose that in addition to the list of well-known domains, `go get` use the following heuristic to identify cases in which `git` is the right vcs: Split the domain into components. If any component is exactly \"git\" or \"github\", assume it is a git repo. This would cover git.apache.org (#10797) as well as most GitHub Enterprise installations.\r\n\r\n10 of the 84 domains at found at godoc.org fit this pattern, so this provides pretty decent coverage.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n/cc @adg @bradfitz \r\n",
