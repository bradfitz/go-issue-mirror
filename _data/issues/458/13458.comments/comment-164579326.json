	"body": "What's happening is that sysmon triggers a forced GC based on memstats.last_gc, but memstats.last_gc isn't updated until mark termination. Hence, once sysmon starts triggering forced GC, it will keep triggering them until GC finishes. The first of these actually starts a GC (gc 7 in your trace); the remainder up to the last print \"GC forced\", but gcStart actually returns almost immediately because it sees the GC is running; then the last may start another GC (gc 8 in your trace) if the previous GC finishes (and sets last_gc) between sysmon triggering it and gcStart checking the GC phase.\r\n\r\nThe fix is trivial. I'll send a CL shortly.",
