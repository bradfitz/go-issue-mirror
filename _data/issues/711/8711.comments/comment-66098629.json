Best link I see is:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.tipandtrick.net/ways-to-disable-or-turn-off-user-account-access-control-uac-in-windows-vista/\"\u003ehttp://www.tipandtrick.net/ways-to-disable-or-turn-off-user-account-access-control-uac-in-windows-vista/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI would use \"Method 2 – Disable UAC Using Registry Editor\" or \"Method 5 – Disable\nUser Access Control from Command Prompt\". You could also use Go to modify registry. We\nhave some registry manipulating code in time/zoneinfo_windows.go and\nmime/type_windows.go. Unfortunately both just do the reads. Or you can pinch some of my\ncode from \u003ca href=\"http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/winsvc/registry\"\u003ehttp://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/winsvc/registry\u003c/a\u003e - it is very primitive,\nbut, I think, it should do the trick. I can write a program for you, if you like.\n\n\u003e Is there some command line tool I can run? \n\nUse \"Method 5 – Disable User Access Control from Command Prompt\" as mentioned above.\nPerhaps there are others.\n\n\u003e Some registry setting? \n\nIt looks like a register setting. See above.\n\n\u003e Does it require rebooting?\n\nI don't know, but I am certain it would. It would even probably prompt you, before it\nwill let you change the registry.
