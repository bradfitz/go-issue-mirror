	"body": "I just had a look and the test fails because strace returns an error: `strace: ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, ...): Permission denied`\r\n\r\nIt happens because of a ptrace protection: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Roadmap/KernelHardening#ptrace_Protection\r\n\r\nSince strace is run asynchronously, the test does not see the error and `http.Get` timeouts. So there is two ways to fix that issue: \r\n - checking the content of /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope\r\n - using child.Run() in a goroutine instead of child.Start()\r\n\r\nI think the second fix is the best one. I can send a CL if needed.",
