	"title": "proposal: different octal base literal representation",
	"body": "## Shortly\r\n\r\nProposal is to add an alternative syntax for representing octal literals and deprecate the current syntax in Go 2+. Deprecation is not necessary, but is personally perceived to be inline with Go's idioms\r\n\r\nCurrent syntax: `octal_lit   = \"0\" { octal_digit } .`\r\nProposed change: `octal_lit   = \"0o\" { octal_digit } .`\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThe idea is directly borrowed from CoffeeScript, where the feature exists to help developers to avoid various typos in their code:\r\n\r\n* Missed `x` in `0x1234`\r\n* Missed `.` after `0` in `0.1234`\r\n* Missed `.` before `0` in `.01234`\r\n* Extra leading `0` in decimal literal as in `01234`\r\n\r\n## Personal view on the current syntax\r\n\r\nI think that the current syntax for octal literals is outdated and was simply copied from ancestor languages, because the problem it introduced there was not evident. This proposal may very well be rejected on the grounds of Go 1 compatibility promise assesment, but I guess it is good to keep the pressure for a change.",
