There is one more thing though. `072.40` is a perfectly valid floating point number and is equal to `72.40`. To me this is again a confusing language decision.\r\n\r\n\u003e If you can miss x, what stops you missing o\r\n\r\nThe deprecation of a leading `0` to denote octal (floating-point?) literals will turn it into a compilation error.\r\n\r\n\u003e And if you can type that number by mistake, what stops you from typing 11234\r\n\r\nNothing would stop me from typing mistyping any number, correct.
