	"body": "When compiling using buildmode c-archive on darwin/amd64 (targeting the iOS simulator), I run into this error when trying to link the resulting archive to my Swift code:\r\n\r\nld: illegal text-relocation to 'type..eq.[0]encoding/xml.Attr' in .../lib.a(go.o) from 'runtime.rodata' in .../lib.a(go.o) for architecture x86_64\r\n\r\nLooking at the cmd/link/internal/ld/macho.go, it seems that it currently is only checking for shared archives on amd64 when it chooses to use the DATA segment over TEXT.",
