The last one was #11331 fixed by https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/12450/, but that was before Go 1.5 and the report says the problem happened with Go 1.5.\r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot reproduce this. In addition to what's in the initial report, I need:\r\n* the exact contents of all the relevant source files\r\n* the exact command being run\r\n\r\nI have tried to guess these, in particular by running various exhaustive searches over possible ways the imports could be arranged, and I cannot find any cases where otherpkg would be allowed to import mypkg/internal/foo.\r\n\r\nIf you still have the information available, can you give us more detail? Thanks.\r\n",
