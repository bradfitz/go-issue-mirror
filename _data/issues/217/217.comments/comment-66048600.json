The channel\nneeds to be known to the \nruntime so it can signal even if the goroutine exits prematurely,  perhaps from a fault.\n That is not mere syntactic \nsugar.\n\nMarking it WontFix until such time as a full design for exceptions is underway.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
