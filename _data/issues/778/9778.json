	"body": "The [Contribution Guidelines][doc] doc says that `git mail` will automatically cc golang-codereviews on all code reviews. However I mailed the following two reviews today, and it doesn't appear as if that happened for either one:\r\n\r\n1. https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/3902/\r\n2. https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/3950/\r\n\r\nI assume that's because these aren't in the core repository. Can you confirm? And should the documentation be updated to be clearer about what to do for other repos?\r\n\r\n[doc]: https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html\r\n",
