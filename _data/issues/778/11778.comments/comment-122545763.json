	"body": "I suspect the way you are trying to use go install should fail, it's just a slightly confusing error message. When you go install mycmd, it typically installs in $GOPATH/bin, or if it's set, $GOBIN. When cross compiling, there is really no good place to do the installation. Both of those bin directories are designed to be on your $PATH, so creating subdirectories does not make sense.\r\n\r\nIn general with your own programs, you should go build cross-compiled binaries, not go install them. You can use -o to specify where you want the binary to end up.\r\n\r\nHowever cross-compile go installs of cmd/* binaries should work, except cmd/go when GOBIN is set. It looks like that's one case I missed, so I'm looking at it and improving the error message.",
