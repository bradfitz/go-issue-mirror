The problem is pretty clearly this line:\n\n0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: []\n\nHow did that get there?  It implies that 6l decided to add a library with no name. \nThere was a change a couple of months ago to permit #pragma dynimport SYM SYM \"\" in\nwhich the library has no name; is there any chance that you are somehow using a 6l which\nprecedes that change?  Check every 6l on your PATH.\u003c/pre\u003e",
