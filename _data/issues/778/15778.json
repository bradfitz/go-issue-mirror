	"body": "The buildlet, especially in reverse buildlet mode, needs to learn how to kill stray processes leftover from previous builds.\r\n\r\n(This isn't relevant for VM and container-based builders, since the VM or container kill everything when they exit)\r\n\r\nBut on OS X and other weirder builders where we run the buildlet in reverse-dialing mode, I sometimes see stray processes. Like this:\r\n\r\nNotice testgo spinning:\r\n\r\n\u003cimg width=\"918\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-05-20 at 2 32 25 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2621/15442767/f5e99af6-1e97-11e6-9e47-cba5a9477ed4.png\"\u003e\r\n\r\n(I think @ianlancetaylor fixed that bug, but still.... we should be tolerant of such bugs in the future)\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking bug to make the buildlet smarter: enumerate processes at start and end, and kill new things which didn't go away on their own, especially if they're owned or parented by us. Maybe scan the process list often during builds to learn parents, so we know if they were ours or not.\r\n\r\n/cc @zombiezen @adg \r\n",
