	"body": "From #14974, @mikioh suggested adding a BPF/eBPF package to x/net to handle compiling BPF/eBPF programs. Filing this bug to track that proposal and work.\r\n\r\nI have a BPF package in progress, which I'll send out for an API review shortly. Looking at the spec for eBPF, while the VMs have similar names the ISA is different enough that I think we should have two separate packages, and have a FromBPF() helper in the ebpf package to translate Classic BPF into the extended form.",
