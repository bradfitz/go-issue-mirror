Maybe the SSA compiler heats up the chip so the chip scales back the clock frequency during the benchmark.\r\n\r\nPlease try building both binaries beforehand, and alternate running+timing them.  Might also be worth trying the same binaries on both machines, just to make sure it's really the same code.\r\n",
