When the compiler sees the method Foo, it ignores it with an error\nmessage on line 17.  When the compiler sees the attempt to use F as a Fooer, it gives\ntwo errors on line 10, but accurate since the method Foo was ignored.  The order of the\nlines determines the order in which the error messages are reported.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
