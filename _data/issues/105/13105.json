	"body": "There are many character encoding standards such as UNICODE\\UTF-8\\UTF-16\\UTF-32\\UCS\\ANSI\\GBK\\GB2312 and so on. The default that in golang is utf-8. But many times we received others, or we need to send with others , and it's hard for us to deal with. I wonder if golang can support official way to deal with the problem, that means, we can translate the character from one encoding way to another.",
