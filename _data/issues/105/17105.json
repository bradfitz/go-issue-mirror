	"body": "As part of #17104 to improve trybot speed and get Trybots down to 5 minutes, I now see that `linux-arm` is the slowest builder, even sharded 8 machines wide.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that just `make.bash` on `linux-arm` takes 5 minutes itself, even without running any tests, so sharding 8 machines wide doesn't help much.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think about cross-compiling the `linux-arm` `make.bash` on `linux-amd64` (on Kubernetes) first (which takes about 33 seconds), and then pushing that out to 7 real ARM machines for tests? (instead of pushing out the same everything-built tarball from the ARM machine)\r\n\r\nIn parallel, we could run a real ARM `make.bash` (for 5 minutes) to verify it works, but never use its output for testing.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n/cc @ianlancetaylor @quentinmit @davecheney @minux @cherrymui ",
