	"body": "In many text/template scenarios, when creating text files (e.g. csv) for machine consumption, or text documents for human consumption, it's desirable to control the newlines output by the template. Currently this involves jumping through hoops by moving template tags around, making the template very unreadable. A simple e.g \\ character at the end of a line would be nice to escape the newline so it doesn't end up in the output text, but the template tags can still be organized nicely in the template itself.\r\n\r\nSeems there was already a request for this on go-nuts: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/H_d6P6av8nk",
