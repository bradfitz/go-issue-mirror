	"body": "Currently, after a fatal error caused by an unexpected signal during runtime execution, the runtime prints, as an example:\r\n    `[signal 0xb code=0x80 addr=0x0 pc=0x406230]`\r\n\r\nSince the runtime knows about signal numbers, it should print the signal name instead of the signal number.\r\n\r\nSee https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/_FYWG3oU6X8",
