It would be helpful to have some way to signal that we don't want a newline.\r\n\r\n1. Do we want the signal to be part of existing actions? (As in, `{{end FOO}}` where `FOO` is some token that doesn't collide with the current syntax.) Or, should \"no new line\" be an action of its own? (`{{FOO}}` for example) The former has the benefit of brevity, the latter has the benefit of being unambiguous and is probably cleaner to implement \r\n2. Regardless of the answer to question 1, what should `FOO` be? A dash (`-`) is one idea, but there are many other things we can use. Back slash (`\\`) seems more natural to me.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSome text without a {{\\}}\r\nnewline in the middle.\r\n\r\nA list of items:\r\n{{range .Items \\}}\r\n{{.}} {{end}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould produce (where `Items` is `[1,2,3,4]`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nSome text without a newline in the middle.\r\n\r\nA list of items:\r\n1 2 3 4 \r\n```\r\n\r\nHey @robpike what do you think?",
