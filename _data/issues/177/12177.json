	"body": "This issue is related to [this discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/7EwgSelVulM). [The docs](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Test_packages) say:\r\n\r\n\"go test [-c] [-i] [build and test flags] [packages] [flags for test binary]\r\n\r\n\"If the test binary needs any other flags, they should be presented after the package names. The go tool treats as a flag the first argument that begins with a minus sign that it does not recognize itself; that argument *and all subsequent arguments* are passed as arguments to the test binary.\" (Emphasis mine.)\r\n\r\nHowever, try running this command on any package that imports \"github.com/golang/glog\"\r\n\r\n    go test -v pkg -logtostderr -v=2\r\n\r\nWith go1.5rc1 (go version devel +d3ffc97 Wed Jul 29 23:50:20 2015 +0000 linux/amd64):\r\n\r\n    go test: illegal bool flag value 2\r\n\r\nAccording to the docs, -v=2 should be passed down to the binary.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, the docs should be fixed. Also, considering how common some of go test's flag names are, I think the behavior in the docs should also be implemented. However, it seems like there are probably plenty of scripts out there relying on the bad behavior. Perhaps a new directive, say \"--\" could be added, after which the remaining command line would actually be passed unmodified to the child binary.",
