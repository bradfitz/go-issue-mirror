Right now, the only way for an arg to make it into [passToTest](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/5bf1369c9ba09df6df2fbd3b8221f22b1d52d2ee/src/cmd/go/testflag.go#L117) unmodified is if testFlag() returns nil for f. I can't see any revisions where that was different, but I didn't look at all of them -- I just picked a few randomly including the initial.\r\n\r\nThe fix/feature would be to put an else [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/5bf1369c9ba09df6df2fbd3b8221f22b1d52d2ee/src/cmd/go/testflag.go#L100) that simply appends the flag to passToTest if inPkg. That would make the behavior conform to the doc, I think. Probably we'd want to change the name of inPkg to \"startedPkg\" or \"seenPkg,\" since the current name implies that you can leave once you begin.",
