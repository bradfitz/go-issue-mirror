On Solaris... ifindex+family uniquely describe this.\r\n\r\nSo, on my box there are two interfaces with ifindex: 1... one is IPv4 and the other is IPv6... the test fails because these two interfaces have different MTUs.\r\n\r\nI see two solution... fake an ifindex, or unbreak this uniqueness assumption.",
