If so, this must have been fixed in Windows 8 since I do not have the same issue with MiniRedir version 6.3.9600 (http://pastebin.com/X7ggpht5).\r\n\r\nStill, I would like to see what is going over the wire. Could you please dump the HTTP traffic between the WebDAV handshake of your Windows client with the current, vanilla litmus server in the net/webdav package? The log I dumped at pastebin is from http://github.com/rsto/logproxy but you might just as well use netcat or any other reverse proxy. ",
