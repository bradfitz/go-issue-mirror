Compile the command at \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/T_PoIzdqIY\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/T_PoIzdqIY\u003c/a\u003e\n2. Run the command on a PE file which doesn't have any symbol table. (The\nNumberOfSymbols is equal to 0 in the IMAGE_FILE_HEADER structure). Notepad.exe contains\nno symbol table on my XP machine (I can't attach it for obvious reasons).\n3. Check if the command succeeds.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nBeing able to open the PE file without an error.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\u0026quot;2012/09/30 22:05:58 EOF\u0026quot;\nAn io.EOF error, which results from a failed read operation while trying to get the COFF\nstring table in pe.NewFile.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\ngo install (6g)\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nlinux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version devel +d1beb5cd107e Sun Sep 30 10:35:09 2012 +0200\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
