	"body": "The pre-SSA backend checked the value of runtime.writeBarrier with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCMPB\truntime.writeBarrier(SB), $0\r\nJNE\t$0, 167\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe SSA backend uses:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMOVL\truntime.writeBarrier(SB), AX\r\nTESTB\tAL, AL\r\nJNE\t$0, 168\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe old version is one instruction and one byte shorter and does not use a register.\r\n\r\nI tried and failed to use the old check in CL 21817. Generating flags directly from memory does not play nicely with how we currently handle flags; see Keith's comments.\r\n\r\nThis issue is so that we don't forget, and to discuss alternative approaches.\r\n",
