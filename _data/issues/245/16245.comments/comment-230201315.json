We now observe the following test failure:\r\n```\r\n--- FAIL: TestGetfsstat (0.00s)\r\n\tsyscall_bsd_test.go:31: an empty Statfs_t struct was returned\r\nFAIL\r\n```\r\nI don't see the failure on 4.4.x, so I guess that it may be a side effect of hammer2 improvement work: http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/commits/2016-June/541618.html.",
