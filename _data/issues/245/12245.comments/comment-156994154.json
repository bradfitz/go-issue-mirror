	"body": "I had time on Sunday and ended up implementing this (what was decided on Aug 27) for my personal use (using some of the earlier prototype code I'd written). The change is on the following branch: https://github.com/sridharv/mobile/tree/multibind2\r\n\r\nThe current status:\r\n\r\n   * Tested and working on Android.\r\n   * Referring to exported types from another package supported.\r\n   * Common generation code for gobind and gomobile bind.\r\n   * Custom prefixes/package paths not tested.\r\n   * Unit tests present for ObjC but not tested in an actual app.\r\n\r\nIf this will be useful I'll write up the approach I took, test for iOS and send the CL for review. I'm happy to make any changes needed. If it's not useful I'll use it for my work now and cut over to the official version when it lands :)\r\n",
