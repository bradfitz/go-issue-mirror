That's what that code is trying to take care of.\nThe only difference between the AROLL case and the default case is:\n\nif(copyas(\u0026p-\u003efrom, v))\n    if(p-\u003efrom.type == D_CX)\n        return 2;\n\nbut here p-\u003efrom.type is not D_CX, so I don't understand why this is\nhaving any effect. Do you have any ideas?\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
