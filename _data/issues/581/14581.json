	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.6 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n(Use play.golang.org to provide a runnable example, if possible.)\r\nI read documentation at https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/#Regexp.FindAllStringSubmatch.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI expected easy to find documentation for all parameters.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nInstead I had difficulty discovering what the `n` parameter does.\r\n\r\nInitially I ended up finding my answer on a stack overflow question, but later it was pointed out that the 'n' parameter is documented in the package level documentation.  The package level documentation is well written and would have answered my question, but it is currently very difficult to find.  Part of the problem is that it is within a paragraph so it is not easy to just browse to it and searching the page for 'n' is also not efficient.\r\n\r\nTwo solutions that come to mind are documenting the parameter on the functions that use it or maybe just renaming it to something searchable like `count`.",
