More info here: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#LoadLocation\r\nIt's easy to solve on Docker:\r\n- add `zoneinfo.zip` in the image (copy from `$GOROOT/lib/time/zoneinfo.zip`)\r\n- set the `ZONEINFO` env variable\r\n\r\nBut I don't know how to do that with `x/mobile`.\r\nThe list of scanned directories is: https://golang.org/src/time/zoneinfo_unix.go#L31\r\nThey don't exist on a mobile phone.\r\nCan we embed `zoneinfo.zip` in the application package and override the `ZONEINFO` env variable with `x/mobile`?",
