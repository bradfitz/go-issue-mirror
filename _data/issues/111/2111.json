When it hits EOF, I'll sleep for a bit and try\nagain when the other process writes some more bytes.\n\nThis works fine with os.File, but not if the os.File is wrapped with bufio.Reader. The\nreason is because bufio.Reader (and bufio.Writer) store error state and just return it,\nso the EOF error code always remains.\n\nIf you guys agree that this is a bug, I'll send along a patch.\u003c/pre\u003e",
