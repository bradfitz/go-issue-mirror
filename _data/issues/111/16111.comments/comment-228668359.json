	"body": "I disagree with this change. The package claims that all \"/\" are replaced with Seperator unless otherwise specified. Some functions document the negative behavior (stating they don't replace \"/\" with Seperator). This change documents positive behavior for Clean(). But is Clean the only one that needs to re-affirm this? As a user, I can no longer reason about the behavior of other functions in the package that have neither positive nor negative documentation. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, It would be better to properly document the negative behavior for all functions and fullfill the \"unless otherwise specified\" contract in the documentation. Then the positive redundant documentation can be removed.\r\n\r\n",
