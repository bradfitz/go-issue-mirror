	"body": "@as, thanks for feedback. As I understand, you're referring to the current CL (aka, the proposed solution), and not the issue filed here.\r\n\r\nMy initial plan for the CL to resolve this issue was to simply add the phrase `Any occurrences of the slash ('/') character are replaced with Separator when returning path.` to _every_ method except the two (Split and SplitList) that don't do it.\r\n\r\nWhen I looked at the other methods, it seemed to me that they already specify that \"path is Cleaned\" before being returned. So as long as the user understands that `Clean` replaces the slashes, they can know exactly what the other functions perform.\r\n\r\nThe package document still mentions that _most functions_ do the replacement, which makes it harder to miss.\r\n\r\nHowever, now that I took another closer look at the other methods, it seems only `Join` and `Dir` explicitly say that the path is Cleaned before being returned:\r\n\r\n\u003e Dir returns all but the last element of path, typically the path's directory. After dropping the final element, the path is Cleaned and trailing slashes are removed.\r\n\r\n\u003e Join joins any number of path elements into a single path, adding a Separator if necessary. The result is Cleaned, in particular all empty strings are ignored.\r\n\r\nSo I think the CL needs to be updated to make it clear (explicitly) for all other methods that slashes will indeed be replaced.",
