The man page seems to imply that other tools need to handle it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-v, --verbose\r\n    Show unified diff between the HEAD commit and what would be committed at the bottom of the commit message template to help the user describe the commit by reminding\r\n    what changes the commit has. Note that this diff output doesnâ€™t have its lines prefixed with #. This diff will not be a part of the commit message. See the\r\n    commit.verbose configuration variable in git-config(1).\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll I could find is other projects doing this line inspection that you proposed. I'll send a CL tomorrow, as I use this option frequently.",
