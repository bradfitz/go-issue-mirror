In -v mode stdout/stderr is connected to the 'go test's actual\nstdout/stderr, so that output shows up as soon as it is generated. This is a feature.\nUnfortunately it means that you cannot tell something else has the fd open when the test\nexits. I don't see any way around this, and the bug is much less significant than the\nfeature, so it's working as intended.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
