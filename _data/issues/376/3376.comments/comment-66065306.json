Microsoft does not really believe in 'everything\nis a file'.  We should accept that and use the console writing \nfunctions for writing to the console, instead of the generic\nfile-writing function.  Detecting the console this way\nwould let us write small enough buffers (or whatever is\nprovoking this) and would also let us use the W form of the\nfunction, so that the console would understand we're writing\nUTF-8.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to **---**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
