Notably run the attached test with and without the -v to see one run pass, and\nthe other hang and eventually fail.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/6R0zNv4uAN\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/6R0zNv4uAN\u003c/a\u003e (also attached)\n2. Run test with -v, and see it pass: go test -v gotestv_test.go\n3. Run test without -v, and see it hang: go test gotestv_test.go\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nThe behavior should be the same between the two. IMO the external process shouldn't\nblock the test run from finishing, so the behavior when using -v of the test succeeding\nis the correct one.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nThe test hangs when not using -v.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nMac OS X. Also reproduced on Linux.\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo version go1.2 darwin/amd64\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/7376/0/gotestv_test.go\"\u003egotestv_test.go\u003c/a\u003e (234 bytes)",
