	"body": "Thanks @scisci. \r\n\r\nThe xcode project complains it couldn't find the module Lib (yeah, I see the xcodeproj has a link to your directory :-) I just rebuilt the framework using the build-lib.sh there. FYI, the current version of gomobile bind produces the module map, so you don't have to manually tweak the framework for use in swift any more.\r\n\r\nAnd with iPhone6 simulator (iOS8.4), I couldn't reproduce the crash. From your crash log, I guess you also tried with a simulator. I am puzzled.\r\n\r\nWhich version of go, and gomobile did you use? Does the problem still exist when you try with the tip?\r\n",
