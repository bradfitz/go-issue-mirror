At least the import/export code is very deterministic.\r\n\r\nI've tried this also with my latest devel version (not yet committed) that has better support for export format version skew detection - same result.\r\n\r\nI suspect that you still have some package files that use an outdated format somewhere. I'd recommend blowing away all installed package files and to recompile with the latest compiler. I'm reasonably confident that this will solve the problem.\r\n\r\nI have several pending changes (see #16881) which should hopefully make these errors a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nClosing for now. If you still see a problem after re-installing your packages and upgrading to the latest compiler, please re-open this. Thanks.\r\n",
