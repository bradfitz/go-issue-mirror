Unfortunately this is a private and proprietary program; I can’t share its source without at least an NDA and certainly not publicly. If it helps, according to [cloc](http://cloc.sourceforge.net) it has 121,123 lines of code (excluding comments and blanks) across 1,059 files. That’s including all vendored dependencies — as far as I can tell it excludes only the standard library. And I’m pretty sure all those files are included in compilation — we use Godep and I _think_ it only includes the specific packages that our program actually uses.",
