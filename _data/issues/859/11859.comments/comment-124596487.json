The LOC count doesn't matter as much as what the actual lines are. :) If you want to poke at it more, you can run the compiler and linker with cpu and memory profiling enabled and share your findings in case there is anything usual. However, given the slowdown level you report, I'd guess that there's nothing peculiar to your code base. I'm going to close this for now. Feel free to reopen if you have significant new info.\r\n",
