I was hoping GetConsoleOutputCP will return something different than 850, because my computer's GetConsoleOutputCP returns 850 too, but my netsh speaks English.\r\n\r\nGoing by your answer, I take it this change https://go-review.googlesource.com/20865 does not fix your problem. Does it?\r\n\r\nDo you know of any other way to fix this issue? A particular Windows API we could call. Maybe some program that we could run to determine your netsh speaks Italian.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAlex",
