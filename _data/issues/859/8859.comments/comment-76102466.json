Anecdotally, it happens more when running all.bash or the full net tests than just the lone test. I am in Portugal at the moment with flaky internet connections; it is possible that the failures are correlated to internet problems, although I have been unable to pin it down. I have also been unable to reproduce this with the test converted to a benchmark (I was hoping to use -memprofile to point to the source of the allocations).\r\n\r\nI'm running 10.10.2 (14C109) with the pprof-enabling kernel patch.\r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions for other things to try to diagnose this, I'm happy to help.\r\n",
