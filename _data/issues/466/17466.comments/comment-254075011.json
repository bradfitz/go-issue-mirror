It has same spirit as channel, it doesn't change \"color of function\", cause waiting on \"future\" is as blocking as waiting on \"channel\" is (uses same syntax and composable with channels using `select`).\r\nThis proposal doesn't change language much, doesn't introduce \"new way of writing code\". It is just convenient and useful synchronization primitive made in spirit of Go.",
