	"body": "I don't like the idea of adding new semantics to `:=\u003c-` and `\u003c-` operations. It will make code harder to read (which we value in Go), because `future` mechanics are quite different from `chan`. I also don't see how resulting solution is any better than `sync.Once + done chan`. I agree that `sync.Once + done chan` requires a bit of boilerplate code, but that is another discussion (generics, lol).",
