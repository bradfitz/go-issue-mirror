But it turns out that the mail messages generated by hg mail to\ngolang-dev get \nblocked. Worse, my ISP filtered out the \"Delivery Status Notification (Failure)\"\nmessages as spam, so I would \nnot have known, except I happened to review my weekly summary of spam, and noticed them.\n\nShould I open another Issue about this?\n\nHere is the relevant content of one of the bounced messages:\n\nHello xxxxxx (removed e-mail addess, Ken)\n\nWe're writing to let you know that the group you tried to contact (golang-dev) may not\nexist, or you may \nnot have permission to post messages to the group.
