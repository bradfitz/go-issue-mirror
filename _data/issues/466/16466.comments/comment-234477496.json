	"body": "@robpike, thanks for your quick reply.\r\nThe code you write in https://play.golang.org/p/VhCbdtJzwz looks great. As you mentioned, there is no excellent implementation reason to have Set as builtin type.\r\nI understand and accept, Golang wants to keep simple principle. On the other hand, I still think the code will be more graceful if we have Set builtin type but not via map. I hope someday someone could give an excellent reason. I will close the proposal anyway!\r\n\r\n",
