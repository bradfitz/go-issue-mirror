In particular, since it's also happening on x86, I don't think this is a memory ordering issue.\r\n\r\nWhere it happens is also scattered. It's often testing $GOROOT/test, but several are in test/run.go itself or the linker invoked by test/run.go. This makes me wonder if this is related to #11617.\r\n\r\nI worked through an informal backwards proof that we're satisfying all of the invariants that *should* ensure checknonempty never fails in trygetfull or getfull. This depended on a few assumptions, like that the compiler is correct, that our lock-free list is correct (note that the above failures cover three different implementations of the platform-dependent part, so that's unlikely to be the problem), and that there's no memory corruption.",
