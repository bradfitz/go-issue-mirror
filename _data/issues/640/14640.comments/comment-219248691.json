Because null is often used in JSON to mean “not present,” unmarshaling a JSON null into any other Go type has no effect on the value and produces no error.\r\n\r\nExample without a struct: https://play.golang.org/p/MmRj0E1bvV\r\n\r\nIf your struct has one of the nullable types mentioned above, such as a pointer, then unmarshaling `null` will set your field to nil:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/vvXkL6gFiR",
