But we don't want to run like\nthat, service have completely different environment (security and other parameters). I\nam certain our builder will have multiple problems in that environment.\n\nI think we want to do what we do now - run builder as desktop program. We should login\nas administrator and start builder program on login. We can configure windows to login\nas administrator automatically (I have never done it, but I am sure it is easy enough -\nI can ask my admin friends or google). As to starting builder on login, it is just a\nmatter of creating short-cut to the program in \"Startup\" menu.\n\n2) How do I run all.bat with exec/Command? Do I pass it to cmd.exe or something? Or just\ndirectly?\n\nOur current builder just calls all.bat, I believe.\n\n3) Does the Go build work if nobody is logged in to the console? Does it run as\nAdministrator then?\n\nOr current builder runs inside user session, with Administrator as user logged in.\n\nI see you have builders running on GCE manually already. This is a good start. Hopefully\nwe can do everything you have plans for. I don't see why we cannot.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
