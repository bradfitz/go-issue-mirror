But what I want is for us to have a general tool,\nlike:\n\n$ go tool debug --builder=windows-amd64 --hg=71b41b413359\n$ go tool debug --builder=windows-amd64 --cl=134560043\n\n.. which will then prepare that environment + patches and ssh you into it automatically,\nwith no knowledge of passwords or IP address or ssh public keys.\n\nSo if we're going to have that work for all the Unix builders, I also want an equivalent\nfor Windows, even if it's an anemic CLI environment.\n\nPerhaps we also have:\n\n$ go tool debug --rpd ...\n\nwhich brings up an RDP viewer at that environment. But I'd like to think about how we do\nssh if possible.\u003c/pre\u003e",
