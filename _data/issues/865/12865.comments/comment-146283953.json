	"body": "\u003e @cespare the error isn't coming from the code itself. The error is coming from lower than the ReadDir function. I wasn't printing the error in my original code.\r\n\r\nSo how do you know there's an error? Is the code panicing?\r\n\r\n\u003e  I'm also not aware of the paths that are available in the playground, so I threw in a random directory to read from. Surely a one line edit isn't that serious.\r\n\r\nYou can e.g. make a tempdir on the playground and populate it.\r\n\r\nOr even if your reproducer has\r\n\r\n    // mkdir /some/path before running this\r\n\r\nthen I would know what to do. FWIW, I did try changing your code to point to a dir that exists on my El Capitan machine and still didn't get any errors.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo back up one step: a good bug report has:\r\n\r\n1. Execution environment (OS, Go version)\r\n1. What you did (best is short, runnable code)\r\n1. What you expected to happen\r\n1. What actually happened\r\n\r\nI understand that (1) is Go 1.5 and Mac OS X El Capitan, but I still don't have a clear understanding of 2, 3, and 4.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to be pedantic or obtuse here -- I really don't know how I can make the problem happen on my machine. Perhaps it's clear to someone else with an El Capitan box handy?",
