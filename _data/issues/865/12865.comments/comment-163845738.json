Mine says:\r\n\r\n    ProductName:\tMac OS X\r\n    ProductVersion:\t10.11.2\r\n    BuildVersion:\t15C50\r\n\r\nRunning my C test program does not show a problem (nor did it on your machine).\r\n\r\nI took your program and replaced \"/some/path/to/read\" with os.Args[1], so I could name the path on the command line and try various directories. I was unable to make the program fail with any directory I tried.\r\n\r\nA few questions then:\r\n\r\n1. If you update to 10.11.2, do you still see the problem?\r\n2. Do you see the problem on every ParseDir, or do you have other concurrent modifications to the directory (such as removal of files)?\r\n3. Using the test program you posted, can you make it fail when reading any of the directories in the Go standard library? If so, which ones?\r\n4. If not, can you give us some other self-contained way to reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nWithout a way to reproduce the problem, I'm very reluctant to reapply that patch. It was a very big hammer, not one we really wanted to use. Without being able to poke at the problem ourselves, I'm not inclined to use it again.\r\n\r\nIf you can't show us how to reproduce it, we can leave things as they are and hope that someone else runs into the problem and has more luck reproducing it.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
