	"body": "\u003e I'm okay with us changing the DNS resolver logic to more closely match other DNS client libraries if that helps the flakiness, but I'm hesitant to do things like change default timeouts / retry logic just to appease flaky tests.\r\n\r\nFlaky tests is how I started down this path, but then I realized our DNS client just might need work too.\r\n\r\nBut looking at the cited test failures, I see one is pure Go, one is cgo, and one is `dial udp 8.8.8.8:53: i/o timeout` ... how does a UDP dial time out!? Isn't it instant?\r\n\r\n\u003e A possible testing-side fix: we could run a simple local DNS server that just knows how to respond to certain fixed DNS queries. It doesn't even need to implement proper DNS packet decoding. It just needs to copy the 16-bit query ID at the start of the packet, and then do an exact byte-string lookup on the rest to decide on a response.\r\n\r\n@adg and I started working on that once (can't find the bug) but never finished, apparently.",
