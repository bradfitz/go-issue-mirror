(see the attached file)\n\nPerhaps modifications to the signal package could make it easier to use. If you have a\nproposal, discuss it on golang-dev. Otherwise this is working as intended as far as I\ncan see.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/865/1/signal.go\"\u003esignal.go\u003c/a\u003e (419 bytes)",
