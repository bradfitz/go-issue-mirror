I'd be surprised if the time\n\u003e to\n\u003e rebuild everything in your GOPATH was greater than the time it took to\n\u003e rebuild your go install, or download a packaged one.\n\nA concrete example for what I meant by \"every time\".\nI have a special GOPATH that has a broken symlink as pkg so that\ngo install will never work for that GOPATH:\n$ ln -s $GOPATH/pkg $GOPATH/pkg\n\nBecause I don't have any cgo packages in that GOPATH, I don't feel\nthe need to every go install anything..... I switch go versions very\nfrequently\nfor that GOPATH, so even if I installed the packages, go build will almost\nalways rebuild everything.",
