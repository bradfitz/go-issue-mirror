So that no rebuilding ever happens -- the user has two copies of the necessary stuff right from the start.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I'm not familiar with Go internals, just conveying what would seem to be logical to a layman.  I mean, until the 1.4 release I had no idea that building a Linux binary with \"static DNS lookups\" (via `-tags netgo`) actually implied rebuilding a part of Go itself.  Of coure, what I'm talking about looks like a special case but oh well... ;-)",
