	"body": "In Go 1.4 we changed \"go build -a\" so that it no longer builds the standard library (issue #8290).  Prior to Go 1.4, programmers who wanted a fully static binary that uses the network routinely built their programs with \"go build -a -tags netgo\".  That no longer works.  There is no longer a simple way do achieve this desirable goal.  We should fix this for 1.4.1.",
