The section on conversions http://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Conversions mentioned above clearly says that T(x), if representable at all, is a *constant* and that it is the *rounded value* after rounding according to IEEE 754 round-to-even rules, if T is a floating-point type.\r\n\r\nFor float64(-1-1000), the rounded value according to these rules is -0 which is not representable as a constant (or so we have concluded separately).\r\n\r\nWe probably need to augment the conversion rule to exclude -0.",
