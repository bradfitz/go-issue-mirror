The compilation of the binary distribution\nuses /usr/local/go.  If you want to install elsewhere, you can set GOROOT\nbut that doesn't change the source file names in the binaries' debug info.\n\nThe only way to fix the source file names is to rebuild from source in\n/opt/go (or with GOROOT_FINAL=/opt/go).\n\nSorry.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
