I believe\r\nthat the http server keeps the connection alive and accepts subsequent\r\nrequests on the same connection, which might explain the low goroutine\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nWhat I had been doing yesterday when this struck was working on this\r\nserver, trying out various things, making changes to the code and bouncing\r\nthe server to try again. When I said it been up a while, I meant it did not\r\ncrash immediately.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately (for this bug), I haven't seen the crash since.\r\n\r\n-Dan\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Jan 13, 2015 at 8:59 AM, Dmitry Vyukov \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n\u003e It had been running for a while.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e Are you sure?\r\n\u003e The crash dump has only two goroutines with ids 1 and 5, so it seems that\r\n\u003e the app has just started and accepted its first connection.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e â€”\r\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\r\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/9576#issuecomment-69778214\u003e.\r\n\u003e",
