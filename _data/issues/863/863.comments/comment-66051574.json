A\nbuilder is a python process that continually checks the Go source repository for new\nrevisions, and when one appears it will attempt to build it and update the dashbaord\nwith its status.\n\nThe instructions are under $GOROOT/misc/dashboard. It's pretty straightforward and\nrequires a small amount of CPU time on aggregate.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-freebsd**, **dashboard**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **HelpWanted**._",
