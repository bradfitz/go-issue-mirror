	"body": "We need some kind of probe phase to gather sub-benchmark information.\nIt would be nice if that phase were clearly identified, for example by b.N==0.\nSome benchmarks have tests that assume there was at least one iteration,\nand those would need updating. We've now updated the standard library.\n\nThis is something people would have to update tests for, but of course non-test\nprograms continue working fine. And the testing package has never guaranteed\nthat b.N \u003e 0. We do break code that depends on things it shouldn't, for example\nwhen we updated sort.Sort in Go 1.6. But we don't want to break too much.\n\nIf, based on beta testing, we decide that there are just too many benchmarks\nin real-world code that will need updating, then we should back off to using N==1\nas the subtest probe.\n\nDecide based on beta testing though, not by guessing now.",
