	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nWindows AMD64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n```\r\n\tres, _ := filepath.Glob(\"C:\\\\*\")\r\n\tfor _, match := range res {\r\n\t\tfmt.Println(match)\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n```\r\nC:\\$$PendingFiles\r\nC:\\$Recycle.Bin\r\nC:\\AudioSwitch\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n```\r\nC:goplay\r\nC:goplay.go\r\nC:liteide\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that it lists content of the $PWD, and then blindly prepends `C:` to stuff.\r\n\r\nThe workaround seems to be to use double slashes `C:\\\\\\\\*`, so that only one separator would get trimmed off.",
