That proposal was vastly more complex.\r\n\r\nI think we should do this, or else provide another mechanism for users to detect that a key was missing. (Another mechanism could be a Decoder mode a la Use Number.)\r\n\r\nIn fact, I thought we already had an issue for this, but I cannot find it now.\r\n\r\nI wrote this in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/6901#issuecomment-210728870:\r\n\r\n\u003e Today, I'm aware of two workarounds:\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e * Separately unmarshal the object into a map in order to obtain and inspect the key set.\r\n\u003e * Use pointers for all field values. For example, the github.com/google/go-github API wrapper [uses pointer fields](https://github.com/google/go-github/blob/dc287189c098690cab775b75e22cf0482d47f9ac/github/issues.go#L21-L39) as a rule for this reason. (But even then, you can't distinguish between \"k\":null and a missing key.)",
