	"body": "by **nick.khanov@yandex.ru**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nPlease, check out the unit tests in the attached patch.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nCurrently []byte{1,2,3} json.Marshals to `\u0026quot;AQID\u0026quot;` (base64 encoded string), but\nif I have my own type:\n\ntype MyByteSlice []byte\n\nthen MyByteSlice([]byte{1,2,3}) marshals to `[1,2,3]`.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nlinux\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\ntip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI suspect that this is a common use-case, to have a type defined as a synonym of []byte.\nI have a\n\ntype ObjectId []byte\n\nin my code to implement a couple of interfaces. It would be neat if it were handled the\nsame way as plain []byte in json: with base64 encoded strings. The attached patch\nimplements the necessary changes for this (it's only a few lines of changes; I also have\nunit tests for this case).\n\nI realize that this change introduces a slight incompatibility in the behavior, but I \nthink that the new behavior is more logical and uniform. And it is quite hard to achieve\nthe desired result in other ways.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2163/0/json-namedbyteslice.diff\"\u003ejson-namedbyteslice.diff\u003c/a\u003e (2717 bytes)",
