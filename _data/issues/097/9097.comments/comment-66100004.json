But using a different syntax than a slice\nliteral has ({[key:] value, ...})? But without the possibility to set len and cap? How\nit's supposed to handle maps? `pm := new(map[t]u, 1, 2, 3)`? What is the key and what is\nthe value? Or map types, as an exception, do not qualify as a 'Type'? Etc.\n\nI think this all shows how much of a bad idea this proposal is.\u003c/pre\u003e",
