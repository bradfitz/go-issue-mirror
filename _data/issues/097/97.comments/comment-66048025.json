If you use GNU\nautoconf, they understand portability and handle all the shell and C portability\nissues very well. At the very least in bash use \"set -o posix\".\n\nThe godefs dependency on gcc 4 is: \n\na) Remove -c option, since usage says -c|-S|-E are mutually exclusive.\n\nb) gcc 3.3.5 does NOT support \"-o-\", instead you need to do \"-o -\", which in godefs\nrequires splitting the option and parameter over two entries in av[]. This will be\npart of my patch set.\u003c/pre\u003e",
