Thankfully I build sendmail regularly from\nsource and it relies on m4, though Bison appears to depend on gm4. This is why I've\nbrought up the portability and requirements issues.\n\nOpenBSD defaults to a POSIX conforming shell (public domain Korn shell) and the make\nsupports many of the conditionals, but prefixed with dot, ie. .ifdef instead of just\nifndef. I don't know if gmake recognises both .ifdef and ifdef, if so, then it would\nbe best to use the common syntax.\n\nThe shell and makefiles should make use of macros for tool names like $BASH, $MAKE,\netc so that they can be substituted easily.\n\nAlso I think I've discovered a dependency on gcc 4 vs my system's older gcc 3.3.5;\nthough I'm still working on that (godefs doesn't appear to work).\u003c/pre\u003e",
