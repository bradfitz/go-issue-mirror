	"body": "by **mksql@yahoo.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n1. Execute .pkg installer for Go v1.1.2 (on a machine with v.1.1.1 installed and working)\n2. Installer fails with error but no explanation\n3. OS X console shows message: \u0026quot;You have not agreed to the Xcode license\nagreements, please run 'xcodebuild -license' ...\u0026quot;\n\n'xcodebuild -license' resolves the issue, but the installer does not suggest this may be\nthe problem. Additionally this install was on a machine that had Go v.1.1.1 installed\nvia the .pkg without any problems, and no Xcode updates had been applied since.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nOS X 10.8.4\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo version go1.1.2 darwin/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nA message with the cause of the install failure would make locating the issue much\neasier.\u003c/pre\u003e",
