It makes little to no difference for Xcode 4 users to have the files from\nmisc/dist/xcode/4/ installed in a Xcode directory.\n\ngo4xcode.sh must be run in order to get syntax coloring to work. The user is probably\nmore likely to find $GOROOT/misc/dist/xcode/4/go4xcode.sh rather than the same file\nplaced in an Xcode library.\n\nIt makes sense to copy the files for Xcode 3, where it's just a matter of copying the\nfiles into the right location to make syntax coloring available in the IDE.\n\nHowever, most people use Xcode 4 instead of 3 now? (soon 5?)\n\n2. The user gets no choice of whether to install these files or not. It's like saying\n\"We've detected that vim is available on your system. Lets automagically setup syntax\ncoloring for you! [copying files ...]\"\u003c/pre\u003e",
