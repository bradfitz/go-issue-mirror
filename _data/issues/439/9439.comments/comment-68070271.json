However, the **exit code is 1** regardless whether:\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e\t-\t`vet` ran successfully, processed all files and found some issues to report,\r\n\u003e\t-\t`vet` did not run successfully due to packages not being installed or missing source.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e\tThere should be some (machine-readable) way to distinguish a failed `vet` run vs. a successful run that found issues.\r\n\r\nActually, that might not be correct.\r\n\r\nWhat's **most important** is that there is always a (machine-readable) way to distinguish between these 2 cases:\r\n\r\n1. A successful `vet` run that found 0 issues,\r\n2. Either successful run that detected 1 or more issues or failed to check everything because of missing packages.\r\n\r\nAnd I think that's currently the case. The exit code from `vet` seems to be always 1 even if it found no issues, but failed to import some package (meaning there may be issues found once package is successfully imported).\r\n\r\nSo, as long as you get exit code 0 with no output, you can be sure there are no `vet` issues. If you get exit code 1, you need to investigate (even if there is no output, no errors caught) until the exit code becomes 0.\r\n\r\nIf that's really the case, then this is likely a non-issue. While it would be _nice_ if `vet` could be more capable at loading/processing packages from source only and display issues right away, it's not critical as long as it can be reliably used to verify there are no issues. I'll let you decide what should be done or if this can be closed.",
