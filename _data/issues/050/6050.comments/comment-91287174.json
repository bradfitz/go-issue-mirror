	"body": "Thanks @josharian, I think the issue is that the state machine stays one byte behind the reader, so in certain cases, an error condition is allocated and cached in anticipation of a possible error on the next state transition (in other words, an error at the current position may not become evident until the next state transition). It looks like my changes will remove the need for that. I can include the test cases from #10335 in my patch to be sure.",
