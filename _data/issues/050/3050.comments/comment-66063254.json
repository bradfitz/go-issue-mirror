I\nsuspect it happens during TestFileServerImplicitLeadingSlash. If you check error\nreturned by os.RemoveAll(tempDir), you will see that sometimes it fails. File delete\nwill fail on Windows, if it is opened. You have no code that sync using foo.txt and\ndeleting it - so sometimes these two clash.\n\nI know it is pain in the back, but that how it works. People who will run this test\nmight endup with new file like 067641025\\foo.txt in their temp directory every time the\ndo that.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
