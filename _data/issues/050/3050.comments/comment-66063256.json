But, as this issue demonstrates,\nts.Close completion does not guarantee that files are closed. If you think it is wrong,\nthen, I think, you have assumption somewhere in your code that does not stand.\n\nYou could try and see it for yourself. Alternatively, if you want me to try things, I\nwill do it. But you have to tell me what to check. I had quick look myself, but I am not\nfamiliar with this code, so I got lost pretty quickly.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
