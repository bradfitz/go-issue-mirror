Example program is in a separate from\npackage directory now.\n\n$GOROOT/misc/cgo/life: still contains both life package and main program. We have\ndecided against the split until we have \"go\" program that will allow us to build these\nwithout Makefiles.\n\nI am happy to rename this into \"$GOROOT/misc/cgo/life: split source files for package\nand main program into separate directories to comply with go build rules\". But, I think,\nit is given once we change our build process.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
