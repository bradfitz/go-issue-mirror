See\n\u003ca href=\"http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-38D/SP-800-38D.pdf\"\u003ehttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-38D/SP-800-38D.pdf\u003c/a\u003e section 7.1.\n\nSince other lengths are converted to 96 bits, the expected properties don't hold. For\nexample, a random 128-bit nonce is not as safe as one would expect. It's a little\ndangerous to use IVs lengths \u003e 96 bits because of this and it's not at all clear that\nusing GHASH to compress nonces is the right thing to do vs using a hash function.\n\nDo you have some common protocol that's using large IVs with GCM?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
