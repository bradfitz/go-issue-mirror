So 128-bit nonces do, in fact, work as expected although\nlarger sizes don't.\n\nStill, I'm not aware of anyone ever using larger nonces with GCM. The IETF also defines\nGCM to have exactly a 96-bit nonce: \u003ca href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5116#section-5.1\"\u003ehttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5116#section-5.1\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWe're not painted into a corner here: support can be added without breaking the\ninterface, it's just a question of justification.\u003c/pre\u003e",
