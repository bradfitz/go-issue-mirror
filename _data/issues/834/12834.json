	"body": "https://golang.org/cl/15263 fixed a place where `quick.Check` is\r\nused without its return value being checked for non-nil.\r\n\r\nI did a quick search, and found that unfortunately, there are 6 more\r\nsimilar cases in standard library alone. (see https://golang.org/cl/15381)\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if cmd/vet should check for this case as not checking\r\nthe result from quick.Check means the automated checks are useless.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps cmd/vet should also check for other functions whose\r\nreturned value must not be ignored.\r\n\r\nI imagine that we don't want a source code annotation is similar to\r\ngcc's `__attribute__((warn_unused_result))`?\r\n(How about project specific cmd/vet rules? If there are enough\r\ninterest, we might be able to start a discussion on this topic too.\r\nI'm thinking about an example based approach, aka eg.)",
