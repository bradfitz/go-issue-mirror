It is a Windows quirk.\n\u003ca href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/263823\"\u003ehttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/263823\u003c/a\u003e has the details. Though it is\nstill not clear to me why this shows up reliably only on 64-bit\nWindows.\n\nRight now, I have to ignore the error of ReadFrom and retry on\nWindows. I cannot think of any other reasonable ways to handle this\nkind of error.\nBut the problem of this ignore-and-retry approach is I have to\ndistinguish this error from other persistent errors such as reading\nfrom closed descriptor by checking the actual error message. That's\nugly!\n\nReadFrom on Linux does not have this behavior. Does it make sense to\nyou to export SIO_UDP_CONNRESET in syscall, so that I can call\nWSAIoctl to disable this behavior?\n\nAnother option is to make this error temporary, i.e. err.Temporary()\n== true, so that I can ignore this error in a cheap and safe way.\n\nThanks,\u003c/pre\u003e",
