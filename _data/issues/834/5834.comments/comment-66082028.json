The program may not fail on\na 32-bit windows.\n\nI used net.ListenUDP, not net.Dial. So the WriteToUDP won't fail in my\nprogram. I don't think you should use WriteToUDP. The write would fail\nlocally with ErrWriteToConnected. But we want the UDP packet to be\nsent to the remote host to trigger an ICMP reset packet. It is the\nICMP reset packet that causes the following ReadFromUDP to fail.\n\nThanks,\u003c/pre\u003e",
