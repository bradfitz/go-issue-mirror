	"body": "\u003e Why maxBadConnRetries is hard coded but not a configurable option? Sometimes I do not want it to retry when connect fails.\r\n\r\nmaxBadConnRetries isn't really about connection attempts; I'd expect a driver not to return ErrBadConn on a failed connection attempt, because it hides the error message from the user.  If the user *does* want to retry, he/she can do it in the call outside of `database/sql`.  Further, setting maxBadConnRetries to 0 would mean that `database/sql` would stop cleaning up bad connections from the pool, which doesn't sound reasonable at all.\r\n\r\nWhat's the actual use case here?",
