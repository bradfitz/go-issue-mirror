(They are somewhat at odds, and I think the implementation does the best it can, clearing the pools at the start of the GC. That means that the objects used during that concurrent GC will not become available for collection until the next one, but so be it.)\r\n\r\nI believe the problems you are seeing are #11677 - the allocations are running too far ahead of the GC.\r\n\r\nAs such, I'm going to close this bug. Please follow #11677, and if you're still seeing problems after that is fixed, feel free to reopen this one (if you can, I don't know what the GitHub permission model is) or open a new one.\r\n",
