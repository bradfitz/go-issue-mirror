I've tried various versions of the command (`lissajoi.exe 1\u003e output.gif`, `lissajoi.exe \u003e output.gif 2\u003e\u00261`, etc) and nothing seems to work. I'm thinking now it's either an `os.Stdout` issue or something on Windows itself but outputting to a file like that should work :(\r\n\r\nAnyway appreciate the response and that it's not a issue with the gif library.",
