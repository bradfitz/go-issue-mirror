In particular, I think that gdk-pixbuf's LZW decompressor is at fault.\r\n\r\nFor example, the \"GIF image loader cannot understand this image\" error message comes from https://github.com/GNOME/gdk-pixbuf/blob/master/gdk-pixbuf/io-gif.c#L634 in the lzw_read_byte function, and the comment immediately above that says: \"FIXME - we should handle this case\".\r\n\r\nI filed a bug on the gdk-pixbuf project: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=765705\r\n\r\n@tanepiper, I need more information than \"it appears to be non-valid\". What programs did you try and open that output file with? What error messages (if any) did it show? Did you try various browsers: Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer?",
