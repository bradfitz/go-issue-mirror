Even so, they serve a useful purpose.\n\nWhat this test is referring to is that getaddrinfo will return 127.0.0.1 once for\nSOCK_STREAM and once for SOCK_DGRAM, even when it appears just once in the hosts file.\nIn this case it has returned it four times, and the Go code has (correctly I think) cut\nit down to two.\n\nI'm inclined to leave this as is unless more people run into it.\nIs it possible for you to get your /etc/hosts fixed?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
