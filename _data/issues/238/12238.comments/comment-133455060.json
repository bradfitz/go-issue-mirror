All other callbacks receives small data, but stat callback receives megabytes of data.\r\n\r\nIt most likely is related to the size of the frame, but it may just be bad luck (stack barriers are inserted at exponentially-spaced points in the stack, so it's hard to predict where they'll fall, but they tend to fall in the same place). What do you mean by \"stat callback receives megabytes of data\"? It's all on the heap, not on the stack, presumably? Though, a large GoBytes allocation could be triggering the garbage collector, which could be part of why you're repeatably seeing the failure at this point.\r\n\r\n\u003e Should I attach any code links?\r\n\r\nNo, thanks, though if this is happening in an open source application or tests, it would be great if you could paste commands to reproduce it.",
