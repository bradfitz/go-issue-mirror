	"body": "To be clear: in my current codebase, the crash only happens with the new code I added to go-sqlite, which introduces C-\u003eGo calls to go-sqlite. Without a C-\u003eGo transition, I cannot trigger the crash.\r\n\r\nI've walked through the call chain on a reduced test case that still involves go-sqlite, and afaict the code is well-formed and never calls any NULL C functions.\r\n\r\nI'll get back to you with the smallest repro case I can produce - hopefully one that has no sqlite in it at all, but if not, then I can at least remove the intermediate layers in my benchmark to narrow things down.",
