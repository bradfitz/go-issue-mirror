That seems designed for failure.\n\nThis bug has a real use case for using -linkmode external.  If you want to use -linkmode\nexternal and get a statically linked binary, it's easy enough to use -extldflags -static.\n\nThe dependency on runtime/cgo is a fair point but I don't think it is a major one for\nmost people.\u003c/pre\u003e",
