	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the\nlatest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/Bh8FhRu7NQ\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/Bh8FhRu7NQ\u003c/a\u003e\n2. click 'run'\n3. corollary: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/ytggyD6PGV\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/ytggyD6PGV\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nAccording to the spec, section \u0026quot;selectors\u0026quot;, point 4: \u0026quot;If x is of pointer\nor interface type and has the value nil, assigning to, evaluating, or calling x.f causes\na run-time panic.\u0026quot;\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe first call to a nil pointer allows the method on \u0026quot;s\u0026quot; to be called. The\nsecond however panics. The difference between the two structs is one byte.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g and the playground.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux, OSX, Playground\n\nWhich version are you using?
