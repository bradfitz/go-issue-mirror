Run readelf -n on the binary, looking for a system-ld generated build-id section\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nA build-id section (.note.gnu.build-id) in the ELF file, which implies that the system\nlinker was run.\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nNo such section.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version devel +267bb9854177 Wed Apr 03 18:23:43 2013 -0700 linux/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThis does seem to work for binaries where cgo is involved. go and gofmt have these\nsections, but gofmt does not.\u003c/pre\u003e",
