Like struct{} is the struct with no fields. It's just\ncompletely regular syntax. You are free to define \"type Interf interface{}\". But\n\"Interf\" is ugly.\n\nAnd again, Java is really the worst example you could take to explain your concerns.\nYou can already find a lot of blog posts explaining all of this (just like you post\nlinks to all those blogs), so I'm stopping here.\u003c/pre\u003e",
