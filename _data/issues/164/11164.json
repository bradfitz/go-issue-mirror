	"body": "Creating pipelines using os/exec is somewhat tedious.  There are a couple of good external packages that provide higher-level interfaces:\r\n  http://godoc.org/gopkg.in/pipe.v2\r\n  http://godoc.org/github.com/ghemawat/stream\r\n\r\nBrad asked me to file an issue to think about making this better for Go 1.6.\r\n\r\nRelated: it's common to want the text of stderr on failure, but not as CombinedOutput.  The pipe package calls this DividedOutput: http://godoc.org/gopkg.in/pipe.v2#DividedOutput",
