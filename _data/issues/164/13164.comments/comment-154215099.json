You say that you have a shell script running \"go test\" in a loop.\r\n\r\nIs that Go program using os/exec?\r\n\r\nHow exactly are you starting the program whose signals are blocked?\r\n\r\nWhat does the C++ daemonizing application have to do with this?  Is that the test, or is that the production system?\r\n\r\nWhich signal(s) exactly are you using?\r\n\r\nDo you have a small reproduction case that you could share?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
