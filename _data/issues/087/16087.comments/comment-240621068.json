He's saying that by the time we have an int128 type (distant future), only then would we care about the year 2262, and if we had an int128 anyway, then we wouldn't need to do anything in this issue, because nanoseconds would again be sufficient.\r\n\r\nJokes are funnier when they're explained, I know. Sorry.\r\n",
