Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.7\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\nI just want to code a log analyse tool. Since log files are huge , it's not possible to decompress to plain text and analyse .\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nI want to locate/seek to the position as os.open does.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\nSince gzip has no seek function , I tried using seek func on os.open or say io.reader object, and send to gzip.newreader.  But when I tried to bufio.readbyte, it raised  panic runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference.\r\n\r\n",
