Would people prefer for section 4.2.1.3 (Key Usage) to use language closer to the language for extended key usage? \r\n\r\nhttp://lists.shmoo.com/pipermail/hostap/2014-February/029519.html\r\n\r\n\u003e and EAP-TTLS (RFC 5281):\r\n\u003e    Clients and servers should implement policies related to the Extended\r\n\u003e    Key Usage (EKU) extension [RFC5280] of certificates it receives, to\r\n\u003e    ensure that the other party's certificate usage conforms to the\r\n\u003e    certificate's purpose.  Typically, a client EKU, when present, would\r\n\u003e    be expected to include id-kp-clientAuth; a server EKU, when present,\r\n\u003e    would be expected to include id-kp-serverAuth.  **Note that absence of\r\n\u003e    the EKU extension or a value of anyExtendedKeyUsage implies absence\r\n\u003e    of constraint on the certificate's purpose.**",
