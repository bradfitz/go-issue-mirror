Could it be that if I set GOARM=7 in the first run those object files are then compiled with GOARM=7. It seems those object files are then also used for all other builds even though I e.g. porvide GOARM=6. \r\n\r\nDeleting `$GOROOT/pkg/linux_arm` actually fixed that issue for me.\r\n\r\nAlso: I found the error messages/hints in 1.4.2 much better (as they hint to using a different GOARM setting)",
