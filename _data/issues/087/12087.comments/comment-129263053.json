Stop setting GOROOT. In an overwhelming number of these reports, setting GOROOT, no matter how well intentioned, was a contributing factor. \r\n\r\nIf you are building Go from source you can follow a procedure like http://dave.cheney.net/2014/09/13/how-to-install-multiple-versions to achieve what you want.\r\n\r\nIf you are not building from source, and using the tar version of Go, then you can place different versions of Go into something like /usr/local/go1.4, /usr/local/go1.5 and use a symlink, `ln -nfs go1.5 go` to place the version of Go you want in the correct place temporarily, or just move the directories around.\r\n\r\n2. Please make sure that your go 1.5 iinstall, /usr/local/go/pkg/ contains no `linux_arm` artifacts. It should not, but if you have made your user the owner of this directory the go tool could have written there (or if you used the sudo hammer).\r\n\r\nThis advice does _not_ apply to Go 1.4 and earlier, in fact, the opposite is true.\r\n\r\nI noticed that in your sample above \r\n```\r\n$ GOARM=6 GOARCH=arm go build -o ./ts-pi-cc\r\n$ file ./ts-pi-cc\r\n```\r\nDid not print a warning about a missing math.a file. Which, while a bug which i'm going to raise, is an indication that your go1.5 installation has been altered and this may be contributing to the issue.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDave",
