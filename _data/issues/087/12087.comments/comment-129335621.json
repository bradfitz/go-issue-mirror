	"body": "\u003e It seems that for cross-compilation go creates some object files in $GOROOT/pkg/linux_arm but only the first time I cross compile. Could it be that if I set GOARM=7 in the first run those object files are then compiled with GOARM=7. It seems those object files are then also used for all other builds even though I e.g. porvide GOARM=6.\r\n\r\nThis would happen if you used `env GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=n go install` _and_ `$GOROOT` was writable by you user.\r\n\r\nAfter Go 1.3 (maybe even in Go 1.3) GOARM stopped being applied at the link stage, and was applied at the compile stage (when the runtime is compiled) which meant the compiled packages in `$GOROOT/pkg` were then customised for the `GOARM` version.\r\n\r\n\u003e Deleting $GOROOT/pkg/linux_arm actually fixed that issue for me.\r\n\r\nThanks, closing\r\n\r\n\u003e Also: I found the error messages/hints in 1.4.2 much better (as they hint to using a different GOARM setting)\r\n\r\nCan you please log a separate issue for this.",
