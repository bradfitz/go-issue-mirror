With a lot of boilerplate code, I could add some of this myself.\nStill, I have no idea how I can get column type information with the current\ndatabase/sql in all cases I listed.\nFor SHOW queries, adding them by hand by reading the manual will require a lot of code\nand quite some time in the depth of the MySQL documentation (including which SHOW\nqueries to leave out because they were added in Version X or added two new columns in\nversion Y). But knowing the types used in user specified queries is still harder.\nFor JOINs, it can probably be done by parsing the SQL and inspecting the table structure\nwith SHOW queries. Concerning aggregation functions, I have no idea what approach I\nshould take.\u003c/pre\u003e",
