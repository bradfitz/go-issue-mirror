The drivers may\nhave access to additional information, e.g. the column type, creation comment, character\nset and collation, precision for decimal types, ...\n\nAfter the driver's native row iterator (driver.Rows) is stored in sql.Rows or sql.Row,\nthe available information except for the names cannot be accessed any longer, but it is\nuseful for applications:\n * deriving the SQL needed for ALTER TABLE statements when a column should be changed\n * using the closest matching type when data is serialized (e.g. numbers in JSON)\n * formatting table columns for an html export by column type\n * generating code to scan into structs from any query\n * exploring unknown databases in tools not coded for a specific database\n\nWith the changes proposed in the issue, drivers can provide functions like\n  func ColumnTypes(rows *sql.Rows) []reflect.Type\n  func ColumnSql(rows *sql.Rows) []string\n\nThe proposed change intends to enable drivers to add such functions to a driver but to\nhide the native driver implementation from everything but the driver and to keep the api\nof database/sql as is.\n\nThe only way to do this right now uses unsafe to access the rowsi field in sql.Rows.\n\nAdding all the functions to database/sql is the wrong approach because the available\ninformations varies by used DBMS.\u003c/pre\u003e",
