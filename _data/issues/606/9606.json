	"body": "On Unix systems, Remove/RemoveAll will work even if the files are chmod 0600. On windows, Remove/RemoveAll will not remove a file marked as read-only. If you want to write a Go program that deletes a file, you need to take special care on windows. That's sad.\r\n\r\nSince we determine the semantics of Remove/RemoveAll, we could make this \"just work\" and save our users some effort.\r\n\r\nDiscussion started here: https://go-review.googlesource.com/2930",
