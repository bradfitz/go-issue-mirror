Just added the work around and can finally run builds on windows with proper disk cleanup at the end :) I don't really run the server on windows except when developing it, where disk cleanup is not that important. Lucky thing that I was looking at 1.5 milestone issues for no real reason, just to find this.\r\n\r\nNotes if anyone gets this same one in the futures: I ended up using the cmd.exe work around. \"del\" did not work as I wanted to remove directory that had 1-N git repos inside it down the tree. The dir recursion to change the read flag is potentially heavy if you have big repos.\r\n\r\n```cmd := exec.Command(\"cmd.exe\", \"/C\", \"rmdir\", \"/S\", \"/Q\", dirPathWithWindowsSeparators)```\r\n\r\nEnded up using that. Just make sure the folder exists or you'll get an error from `cmd.Run()`.",
