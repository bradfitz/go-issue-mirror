	"body": "Your argument is \"os.Remove must make every effort to delete the file\". Isn't it?\r\n\r\nBut, if we assume that premise, then we should do the same on every platform. For example in my example above:\r\n\r\n$ rm a/f2\r\nrm: cannot remove `a/f2': Permission denied\r\n\r\nshould we try and change 'a' directory mode and try to delete a/f2 again? Because that is what you're effectively proposing for windows os.Remove.\r\n\r\nTo me it is all about being reasonable here. The \"read-only\" flag is set for a reason. Lets not delete the file until we understand that reason.\r\n\r\n\u003e To put it another, should the API refrain from deleting any file not\r\n\u003e writable by the current user on other platforms?\r\n\r\nI say we should leave thing as they are. We use \"standard\" system API. Whatever it does is most correct for general case scenario.\r\n\r\nAlex",
