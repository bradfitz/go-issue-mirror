It also prevents from the file to be deleted.\r\n\r\nC:\\tmp\\aaa\u003eecho \u003e a.txt\r\n\r\nC:\\tmp\\aaa\u003eattrib +r a.txt\r\n\r\nC:\\tmp\\aaa\u003edel a.txt\r\nC:\\tmp\\aaa\\a.txt\r\nAccess is denied.\r\n\r\nC:\\tmp\\aaa\u003eattrib -r a.txt\r\n\r\nC:\\tmp\\aaa\u003edel a.txt\r\n\r\nC:\\tmp\\aaa\u003e\r\n\r\nOn linux it would be similar to:\r\n\r\n$ ls\r\n$ mkdir a\r\n$ touch a/f1\r\n$ touch a/f2\r\n$ ls -l\r\ntotal 4\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 brainman brainman 4096 Jan 16 10:54 a\r\n$ rm a/f1\r\n$ chmod a-w a\r\n$ ls -l\r\ntotal 4\r\ndr-xr-xr-x 2 brainman brainman 4096 Jan 16 10:54 a\r\n$ rm a/f2\r\nrm: cannot remove `a/f2': Permission denied\r\n$ chmod u+w a\r\n$ ls -l\r\ntotal 4\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 brainman brainman 4096 Jan 16 10:54 a\r\n$ rm a/f2\r\n$ rmdir a\r\n$\r\n\r\nBasically you have to change the flag before you will be allowed to delete the file.\r\n\r\nAlso some explanation from http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/samba/book/ch05_03.html\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\r\nDOS filesystems are not designed for multiple users, and so its designers decided that read-only means \"protected against accidental change, including deletion,\" rather than \"protected against some other user on a single-user machine.\" So the designers of DOS prohibited removal of a read-only file. Even today, Windows file systems exhibit the same behavior.\r\n\u003c\u003c\u003c\r\n\r\nI don't see wining this argument, but I am trying.\r\n\r\nAlex",
