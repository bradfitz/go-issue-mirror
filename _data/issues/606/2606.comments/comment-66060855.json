For example in my app (gocode) I use os_posix.go and os_win32.go files for OS\nspecific code. Goinstall can't handle that at the moment and this is the only thing that\nstops me from making my app goinstallable.\n\nOf course I can do that at runtime, but it should be done at compile-time.\u003c/pre\u003e",
