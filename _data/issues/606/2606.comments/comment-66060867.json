I see the new go tool does stuff under\n/tmp now, so maybe it breaks that plan...\n\nUse case: with the current Go Makefiles, we compile all our packages and test binaries\nin Jenkins, archive them as artifacts, and then we have other Jenkins jobs that farms\nout the test binaries to separate machines that run them and see if they pass.\n\nIt's also nice to just be able to quickly check if all the tests in a big project build\n(without running them... not all our machines even have the right hardware to run all\nthe tests) before you push a smallish fix to a repository.\u003c/pre\u003e",
