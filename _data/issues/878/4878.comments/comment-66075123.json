Check whether the first word\nof the TCP points at itself.\nBefore tcp_fixup, it does. Afterward, it does not. The signal handler can use this to\ndecide whether there is a valid m and g worth loading. The new \"run Go on C threads\"\ncode can do the same.\n\nThat should eliminate the need for the pthread_create hook hack.
