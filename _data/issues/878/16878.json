What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\ngo version go1.7 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nStart a HTTPS server with ListenAndServeTLS\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nHandling a lot of short connections\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nNot handling a lot of short connections\r\n\r\nSo basically, the TLS handler is bad at handling large number of short connections,\r\nand works a lot better when I removed the \"tcpKeepAliveListener\" from this line:\r\ntlsListener := tls.NewListener(tcpKeepAliveListener{ln.(*net.TCPListener)}, config)\r\n\r\n(I disabled KeepAlives with SetKeepAlivesEnabled anyway)\r\n",
