But it just\nrequires some special circumstances to occur.\n\nThis is quite risky to push it in into Go1.1. So I think it is at most Go1.1.1.\n\nIan, what do you think about the patch?\nRuntime can not sustain arbitrary messing with system environment. For example, C code\ncan setup own signal handlers and that would break the runtime as well. So this change\nis somewhat questionable. But I think we need to at least assert that SP belongs to\ngsignal stack.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**, **go1.1**._\n\n_Owner changed to @dvyukov._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
