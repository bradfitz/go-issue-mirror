Similarly for subbenchmarks, but at least it\r\nshould be faster to probe for subbenchmarks with b.N = 1.\r\n\r\nThat is, to query all the tests, we basically have to run all\r\nthe tests once. I think this drawback negates all the benefit\r\nof querying for a list of tests in the binary (because we can\r\nalways parse the test output if we are allowed to run the\r\ntests.)\r\n\r\nOne compromise solution is this:\r\n-test.dryrun: it only outputs a list of top-level tests and\r\nbenchmarks that will be run if -test.dryrun is not given.\r\nsubtests and subbenchmarks for included tests are not\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nAny opinions on this?\r\n\r\n(Update:)\r\nWe can also add that if the -test.run or -test.bench\r\npattern uses the subtest/subbenmark matching format\r\n(i.e. including '/'), then matched subtests and subbenchmarks\r\nwill be included.",
