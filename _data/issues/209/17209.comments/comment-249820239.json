	"body": "Indeed it won't work with subtests and only partially with benchmarks. I thus think that they \"-dryrun\" flag is a bit misleading. You can now achieve the same by using \"-benchtime=1ns\".  This also more accurately indicates what is going on in reality.  BTW, we actually thought for a moment to have the trial be N=0 instead of N=1, which would have made this more feasible, but it caused too many incompatibilities.\r\n\r\nHaving a feature that just lists top-level tests, benchmarks, and examples without running might still make sense, but adding -dryrun for displaying either matched subtests or sub-benchmarks doesn't make sense to me, especially as you can't do anything more than what you can do today.\r\n\r\nI could imagine doing something like only \"probing\" tests/benchmarks if static analysis shows that it will call Run. This will go a long way in providing the wanted functionality , but I'm not sure that we want to go there.",
