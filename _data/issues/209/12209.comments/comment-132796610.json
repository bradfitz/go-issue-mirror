	"body": "Hi @ip. I would very much like to support windows. I have been putting it off as we have had higher priority work, but now that the big ticket gomobile work is done I intend to have a look. In fact, the windows-related code being contributed under x/exp/shiny may make this easier.\r\n\r\nI can't promise when it will get done unfortunately, as there are a couple of other interrupt tasks that take higher priority, but it is something I would very much like to do.\r\n\r\nThis issue is a duplicate of #9306, so I'm going to close it. Please follow along there.",
