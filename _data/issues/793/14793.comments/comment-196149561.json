As such, the comment at https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/regexp/syntax/regexp.go#L71 should be corrected.\r\n\r\nThe `regexp/syntax` documentation does not describe `\\Z`, so it might not be helpful to mention it when describing `$`. https://golang.org/s/re2syntax does describe `\\Z` as \"at end of text, or before newline at end of text (NOT SUPPORTED)\".\r\n",
