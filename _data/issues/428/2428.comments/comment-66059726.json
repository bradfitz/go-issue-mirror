If those methods are exported, then they are exported.  If they are not,\nthey are not.  Your example of a.(one.inner) is separate from the copying of the\ninterface methods. Since one.inner is not exported, that expression is invalid.\n\nEmbedding a struct in another struct means that the fields and methods of the first\nstruct become methods of the second struct.  If the methods are exported, then they are\nexported.  That doesn't mean that you can refer to the first struct if it is not\nexported.\n\nI think this is all clearly described in the spec and I don't see the inconsistency.\u003c/pre\u003e",
