In fact, the alignment before - while it may look\nbetter in some places - was not symmetric (depending on which way the field width\nchanged - up or down on the page)  alignment would change or not.\n\nThe way out is probably to enforce that the latest version of gofmt is used before\nsubmits.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
