We ran the external linker with those flags in the directory for the\npackage.\n\nIn the new world, we just remember them and hand them to the eventual final link\ncommand, which runs in a different directory. \n\nThe only fix I see is to start parsing those strings in order to recognize and rewrite\nrelative paths.\n\nI think that's too big a change for Go 1.2 at this point.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **go1.3**, removed **go1.2**._",
