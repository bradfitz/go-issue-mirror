Of note:\n\n- rolling back to go1.0.3 fixes the issue\n- I do not run into the problem on the darwin_amd64 platform; only on the linux_amd64\nplatform. \n\nHaving the LDFLAGS within cgo comments in a go src file in a package be interpreted\ndifferently depending on where the client build was started seems pretty problematic for\ncreating packages that bundle and use external dso's via cgo.\n\nHow should a developer arrange the files for such a package so that it can be reliably\nincorporated into a client go application using go's internal build system?  In\nparticular, the relative lib search paths needed to find the external dso when the\npackage is built in its own directory vs. as part of a client build must necessarily be\ndifferent?\u003c/pre\u003e",
