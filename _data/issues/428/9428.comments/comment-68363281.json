There are no threads like on the\nother Unix-like systems.\n\nNotably, if you call os.Chdir and then the runtime moves\nyour goroutine onto another proc, the working directory\nwill not have changed. This also happens if you call\nos.Chdir in another goroutine that runs on another proc.\n\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/HPJ_3_82EP\n\nTo fix this, we'd have to change os.Chdir to notify each\nruntime proc that working directory needs to be updated.\n\n(The same problem occurs with with os.Getwd, os.Getpid, and\nos.Getppid.)\n\nI will fix this but it's not going to be pretty. I'll\neither have to send each runtime proc a note or somehow\narrange for the runtime to set the working directory\nwhen a goroutine becomes runnable. I think Russ will\nhurt me if I try the latter, though. :)",
