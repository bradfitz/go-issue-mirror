	"body": "Right now it's quite tempting and perhaps obvious to use C.GoString() on C struct fields that are declared as `char field[N]` (especially in light of issue #12427). However this usage is wrong in a subtle and dangerous way, because the traditional common definition of such fields is that their contents are not null-terminated if they contain something exactly N characters long. Use of C.GoString() thus risks running off the end of the field and into unrelated and possibly unallocated memory under rare circumstances.\r\n\r\nIf you know about this issue it is possible to work around it in Go code (call C.GoStringN() and then remove everything after the first 0 byte). However I think it would be better to provide a support function for this both to make the issue visible to people using cgo and to make it easy to do the right and safe thing.\r\n",
