	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eStatic slices generate two symbols, one for the slice header and one for the backing\narray. These could be combined into a single symbol, laid out with the slice header\nfollowed by the backing array. This would reduce binary size, particularly for the\nunicode tables.\n\nThis does not make sense to do unless \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/7599\"\u003eissue #7599\u003c/a\u003e is also done, otherwise the backing\narray will be needlessly loaded during init.\n\nSee \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/78870047/\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/78870047/\u003c/a\u003e for more discussion.\n\nSomething similar could probably profitably be done for strings and string headers,\nalthough there is a different approach under discussion at \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/7384\"\u003eissue #7384\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e",
