Some servers will do it and some clients will do it, but not all, so we\nintentionally disallow it, to prevent surprises.  It's easier for us to relax this\nrestriction in the future if we discover we're wrong (spec references and comprehensive\ntesting of all major clients \u0026 servers welcome!) than it is for us to allow it now and\nthen take it away.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
