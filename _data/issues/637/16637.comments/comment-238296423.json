It looks like you're running an older machine although I'm not sure the exact model. `cat /proc/cpuinfo` should give me the information I need.\r\n\r\nIt's too late to change this for 1.7. If the machine were a z10 then it may be possible to create a patch to remove uses of the newer instructions. Anything earlier than z10 is a very big task because they don't have the load-relative-long family of instructions (e.g. `LARL`). The Go compiler makes heavy use of these instructions.",
