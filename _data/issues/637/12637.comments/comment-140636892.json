It writes the expected things to STDERR but no complain form the race detector.\r\nTo test if the race detector was working correctly I ran the example shown here: \r\n\r\nhttps://golang.org/doc/articles/race_detector.html\r\n\r\nand the race detector did show the expected error.\r\nDoes this mean that my program does not have a race? Or I cannot see the race detector output because my program is writing to STDERR?\r\n\r\nI look forward to your suggestions.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nJuan Montenegro",
