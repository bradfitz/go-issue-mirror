At least two of them can sign and verify commits and tags with GPG, so if you solved the key distribution problem, it would be easy to write a simple wrapper around `go get` (name suggestion: `gogpggetgood`) which will download *and* verify GPG signatures (that's what I'm doing for [StableLib](https://stablelib.com), although I have no key distribution problem, as the repository is centralized).",
