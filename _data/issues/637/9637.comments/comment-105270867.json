	"body": "Downloading packages over a secure connection is helpful, so I support this change.  But note that it still leaves the user vulnerable to attacks on the servers, and online code servers are unfortunately vulnerable to a wide variety of insider and outsider attacks.\r\n\r\nIt is generally much better to provide public key signatures on the package itself, since the signing process can be done in a much more secure offline environment.  With robust signing and verification, you wouldn't care how the package was distributed.\r\n\r\nI don't see any evidence after a quick browse that go packages can be signed via gpg/pgp.  Is that possible?  Could it be required for official packages?\r\n\r\nOf course the big problem with signatures is how to verify that a trusted key was used to generate the signature, since the web-of-trust model is unwieldy.  But we're making progress on that front with the rollout of DNSSEC making portions of DNS a good place to securely retrieve keys from, and the gpg --pka-lookups and --pka-trust-increase options.   See e.g. [Publishing PGP Keys in DNS](http://www.gushi.org/make-dns-cert/HOWTO.html).\r\n\r\nHas that been discussed?  Does it merit a new issue?\r\n",
