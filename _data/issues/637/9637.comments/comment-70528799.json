The Java/Maven community went through this last year, too. \r\n\r\nI also knew somebody who was given an offer to avoid jail time by instead writing active MITM tools to replace downloaded software over http. And that was 15+ years ago.\r\n\r\nBut I too am belaboring the point. Now that I'm also at fault for voting, let's **stop adding votes to this bug**. Votes can go here: support@github.com and tell them they should add silent voting support for Github Issues.\r\n\r\nThe obvious counter-argument to doing this is compatibility and user confusion, but I think a new flag to proceed anyway, and proper error messages would suffice. The other argument is less complexity and fewer flags, but I think security wins that argument.\r\n\r\nFWIW, every notable code hosting side I can think of does TLS. As for discovery on custom import paths, camlistore.org is TLS (so I don't care myself), golang.org is TLS, but https://rsc.io/x86/x86asm isn't up, so anything importing @rsc's stuff with this would need a flag to bypass. I think having a TLS cert is a valid burden to pay for having a custom import path.\r\n\r\nI am not a decider, though. I will mark this 1.5 for at least a decision either way.\r\n\r\n/cc @adg, @rsc, @robpike, @ianlancetaylor \r\n",
