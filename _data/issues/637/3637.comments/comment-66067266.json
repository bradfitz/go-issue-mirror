Using *server to\ninitialize another global will read it during the init phase (when\nfunc init runs and globals are set up), which is before main.main's\ncall to flag.Parse.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the values aren't available earlier, but you\ncan't determine what the flag values are set to until you know what\nall the flags are (it influences how you parse the command line), and\nyou don't know that until all the packages have gotten a chance to\ninit themselves and potentially create flags.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
