	"body": "4b2774f made sysmon-triggered GC concurrent instead of STW. This means that sysmon will asynchronously signal the forcegc helper, which will asynchronously trigger concurrent GC. Prior to this CL, the forcegc helper synchronously ran a STW GC, which is why we needed the forcegc helper. Now it's unnecessary and sysmon should just trigger concurrent GC directly. This isn't entirely trivial: sysmon can't simply call startGC(gcBackgroundMode) because the bail-out condition at the top of startGC will trigger and nothing will happen.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is to simple eliminate the sysmon-triggered GC.",
