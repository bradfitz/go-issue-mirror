	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. '6g funcequal.go' (attached)\n2.\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nCompiles without error\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nfuncequal.go:16: invalid operation: doCompare == foo (type func(v1 int, v2 int) int ==\nCompareFunc)\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux, amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nd558ddfffe1d+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThe function pointer for doCompare is assigned to a variable which silently converts it\nto the compatible type, CompareFunc.  That variable is then compared with the original\npointer, which seems like it should be possible, given the previous assignment. The\ncompiler errors out because the two function pointers are of different types.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1070/0/funcequal.go\"\u003efuncequal.go\u003c/a\u003e (319 bytes)",
