	"body": "The rsrc tool seems to use an old trick:\nthe internal linker doesn't check the file\narchitecture, so it's possible to link 32-bit\nCOFF object files into 64-bit programs.\n\nso I think the rsrc tool only creates a 32-bit\nsyso file to embed the resources, and it\nworked fine with internal linking (and prior\nto Go 1.5, Go on windows only supports\ninternal linking). This is safe as the COFF\nfile contains only resource, not any code.\n\nNow that Go 1.5 supports external linking,\nand it uses external linking for any code\nthat uses cgo, this problem manifests itself.\n\nBefore akavel/rsrc#11 is fixed, I suggest\nyou use a proper tool to generate two\nsyso files, one for 32-bit and one for 64-bit\nand bundle them with docker.\n",
