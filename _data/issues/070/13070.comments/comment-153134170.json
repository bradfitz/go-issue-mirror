	"body": "@jhowardmsft Yeah, that's what I'll try to do as a quick workaround (?) but the problem is, such a project becomes then somewhat strongly tied to exactly 1 architecture (amd64 in this case), making it significantly more annoying to build on e.g. 386, or potentially some, uhm, Windows RT? or some other arm stuff in the future? [Raspberry Pi maybe](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/windows-10-for-iot/)?\r\n\r\nAs another workaround, I'm thinking if maybe doing something like shown below might maybe work (? untested), but *boy is it ugly*:\r\n```\r\n$ find amd64 386 -t f\r\namd64/rsrc.syso\r\namd64/dummy.go\r\n386/rsrc.syso\r\n386/dummy.go\r\n$ cat rsrc_amd64.go\r\nimport _ \"myproj/amd64\"\r\n$ cat rsrc_386.go\r\nimport _ \"myproj/386\"\r\n```",
