In the\nmach-o world everything in the file must have a valid vmaddr and vmsize, so the __DWARF\nsegment should have an address that comes after the __LIN\u0010KEDIT section (0x75000 +\n0xaef0), and the vmsize must be set correctly so it encompasses all of the \"__debug_xxx\"\nsections. Also each address and size of the \"__debug\" sections should be set to\ncorrectly fall into __DWARF segment range of [vmaddr, vmsize).\u003c/pre\u003e",
