	"body": "by **jonas@pfenniger.name**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIt seems that the go syslog package emits syslogs in a different way than other programs\ncreating variations in the output format.\nThe problem is that there is some duplication in the output that's not necessary.\n\nHere are outputs on different machines. The first lines comes from my go socketmaster\nproject ( \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/pandastream/socketmaster\"\u003ehttps://github.com/pandastream/socketmaster\u003c/a\u003e ) and the second line is just\nsomething else for comparison:\n\nOn Ubuntu Precise amd64 (ryslog 5.8.6-1ubuntu8.4 with default config):\n\n    2013-06-27T22:03:18.480508+00:00 i-5954eb33 2013-06-27T22:03:18Z i-5954eb33 socketmaster[15089]: Listening on tcp://:8080\n    2013-06-27T22:26:22.306421+00:00 i-5954eb33 nginx: - 10.198.69.201 - - [27/Jun/2013:22:26:22 +0000] \u0026quot;-\u0026quot; 400 0 \u0026quot;-\u0026quot; \u0026quot;-\u0026quot; \u0026quot;-\u0026quot;\n\nOn OSX 10.8.4:\n\n    27/06/2013 22:57:58.000 2013-06-27T22[-1]: 57:58+01:00 Big-Whoop.local socketmaster[4807]: Listening on tcp://:8080\n    27/06/2013 22:46:25.576 GitX[82631]: Loaded 5287 commits in 0.100447 seconds (52634.723275/sec)\n\nGo 1.0 and 1.1 produce the same output.\n\nAfter looking around a bit in the code it seems that:\n * Go uses /dev/log or /var/run/syslog instead of the syscall that the other programs use\n * Go writes a full network-formatted syslog line even for localhost\n * It seems that the system logger then prepends it's own info which explains the duplication\n\nSo I guess my question is, would it be possible to change the go runtime to use the\nsyscall like everyone ?\n\nCheers,\n  Jonas\u003c/pre\u003e",
