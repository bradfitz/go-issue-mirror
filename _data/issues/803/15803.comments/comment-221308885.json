	"body": "Having to pass the address all the time is confusing for new users and since it's static and related to the i2c device you are targeting. The part I don't quite understand tho is how/why the proxy would know about the address to implement the `Opener` interface, more specifically the `addr` argument:\r\n\r\n`glcd, err := grovelcd.New(\u0026grovelcd.WebProxy{\r\n    URL: \"http://192.168.159.121:8080\",\r\n})`\r\n\r\nShouldn't the `addr` be available on the package already and therefore the interface could be simplified to:\r\n\r\n`\r\ntype Opener interface {\r\n    Open() (Conn, error)\r\n}\r\n`",
