Try removing the float64 or int conversions in the example and\nsee what happens.\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n\nHowever, removing the float64 conversion doesn't break the script, it looks like the int\nis promoted to a float64 without any issue.  Reading the text implies to me that this\nline would break if it is changed from:\n\n    var f float64 = math.Sqrt(float64(3*3 + 4*4))\n\nto\n\n    var f float64 = math.Sqrt(3*3 + 4*4)\u003c/pre\u003e",
