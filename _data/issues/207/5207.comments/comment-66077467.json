I have to tease it out\nof the datastore so that it can be run standalone, and haven't finished that yet.\n\nFor now, I'd attach three files to the Issue.\n\n- Old implementation of SafeStore (*.bak.go)\n- New Implementation of SafeStore (still causing invalid memory error)\n- Test I had, which cannot reproduce the error\n\nMaybe something will jump out. BTW, with the new safe_store.go, I don't get the hang\nanymore that I reported in \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/5207\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/5207\u003c/a\u003e\n\nHowever, I still see that the value of SafeStore.useLock is seeing false (even though I\nexplicitly set it to true at creation time, and never change it).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5207/13/safe_store.go\"\u003esafe_store.go\u003c/a\u003e (7143 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5207/13/safe_store_test.go\"\u003esafe_store_test.go\u003c/a\u003e (2752 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5207/13/safe_store.go__04052013_104845.bak.go\"\u003esafe_store.go__04052013_104845.bak.go\u003c/a\u003e (7003 bytes)",
