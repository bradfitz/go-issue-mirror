Perhaps this is something in your environment or specific build or something I'm\nnot seeing because I'm using a binary package.\n\nAre you able to provide any errors that may help diagnose this? \n\nIf you are really keen for latest weekly, we have an openSUSE_Factory maintenance repo\nfor Go language, devel:languages:go and I can attest the latest weekly build from there\nis fine, it's at:\n\n    \u003ca href=\"http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/go/openSUSE_12.1/\"\u003ehttp://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/go/openSUSE_12.1/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nand the build service project is located at:\n\n    \u003ca href=\"https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=devel:languages:go\"\u003ehttps://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=devel:languages:go\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIf you install the latest weekly from there you should source the environment script:\n\n    source /etc/profile.d/go.sh\n\nNote that this will set your $GOPATH to $HOME/go, you may wish to override this in your\n.bashrc to set it to what you were used to. This *may* change before Go 1 release.\nThere's a few of the more popular and useful libraries in that repo, not all of them are\nbuilding right now but the OpenGL, mgo packages should have built ok after the weekly\nupdate.\n\nIf you have any issues with the packages from the repo, bug reports to\nbugzilla.novell.com please unless you think it's a language bug.\u003c/pre\u003e",
