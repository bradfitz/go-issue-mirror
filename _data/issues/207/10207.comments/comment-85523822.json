I think the only case\nwhere it will fail is when the foreign thread is started by static\nconstructor.\n\nIn this specific case, I don't understand why our current solution is\ninadequate.\nwe block all signals just before pthread_create, and the new thread should\ninherent the parent threads's signal masks, so no signals will be sent to it\nuntil it explicitly unblocks the signals, but at which point, g is\nguaranteed to\nbe set in its TLS slot.\n\nI still think something is wrong, either lldb's signal handling or the\nkernel\nfails to honor the signal masks.\n",
