	"body": "This happens when C code calls into Go code before any Go code calls into C code.  For example, it could happen if a C++ global constructor calls a Go function.  I don't think there is any other way it could happen.  In a program that uses cgo,  needextram is initialized to 1.  It is set to 0 in the first cgo call, and is never to set to 1 again.  The error occurs when a call from C code to Go code sees that needextram is still set to 1.",
