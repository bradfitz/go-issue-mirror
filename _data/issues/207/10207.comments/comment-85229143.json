	"body": "Huh, badsignal uses cgocallback.  That can't possibly work.  It will fail any time a program that uses cgo starts a new thread that receives a signal before it makes any cgo calls.  This isn't a matter of the signal mask or of the new thread preparing itself to receive signals.  The only question is whether the program has made any cgo calls yet.  If it hasn't, it is doomed.  The comment in badsignal explains the situation well enough, without bothering to point out that this can happen for any signal, not just SIGPROF.\r\n\r\nI think the only possible fix is for mstart1 to say something like\r\n\r\n\tif needextram == 1 \u0026\u0026 cas(\u0026needextram, 1, 0) {\r\n\t\tnewextram()\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nbefore calling initsig.  And then the check in badsignal is not needed.",
