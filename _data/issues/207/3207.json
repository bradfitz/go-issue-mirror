But all previously installed packages were of course lost. That was stupid and I\nsuppose most people just overwrite instead of deleting so not sure if anyone noticed or\nif it's just me but \u0026quot;go get\u0026quot; doesn't fully successfully work with any packages\nout there that I tried.\n\nI read in the go-nuts mailing list of a work-around to export GOPATH to a newly created\nempty directory just before \u0026quot;go get\u0026quot;ting... this \u0026quot;worked\u0026quot; for\nlaunchpad.net/mgo but not for stuff such as\n\u0026quot;github.com/paul-lalonde/Go-OpenGL\u0026quot;.\n\nGuess will have to revert to 2012-02-22 for now. I'm on openSuse 12.1 64bit if that\nhelps.\n\nI also saw in the release notes indeed that the whole go build/get/install system has\nbeen \u0026quot;substantially redesigned\u0026quot;. Well looks like those are breaking changes\nfor 100s of packages being in Real Use Today out there... but maybe I just missed some\nother secret magic guru workaround sauce such as export GOPATH to somewhere it's not\nreally meant to point to?\u003c/pre\u003e",
