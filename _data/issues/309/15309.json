	"body": "Context: http://tour.golang.org/moretypes/7\r\n\r\nI was going through the Go Tour and got to your explanation of slices: http://tour.golang.org/moretypes/7\r\nIt says, \"A slice points to an array of values and also includes a length.\" That makes it sounds like a Slice is an Array with a length value – which I'm pretty sure is wrong. Arrays' types have lengths and slices' don't have lengths (see http://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals which says \"Unlike an array type, a slice type has no specified length.\")\r\n\r\nApologies if 1) I'm just misunderstanding – entirely possible – or 2) this is the wrong component to file the bug\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) review the explanation of slices in the Go Tour: http://tour.golang.org/moretypes/7\r\n2) compare to the explanation in your blog post: http://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals",
