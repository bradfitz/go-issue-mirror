Whether `C.malloc` may support comma error return or not has something with consistency. There are a lot of C functions that has no defined or uesless `errno` such as `C.malloc`, `C.free`, .... It is consistency to support comma error return regardless of advantage of that `errno`. I think unnecessary consistency is a consistency for consistency.\r\n",
