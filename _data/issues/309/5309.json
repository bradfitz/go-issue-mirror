It's a\nsample program for an IRC library. It connects to Freenode and attempts to log in, but\nreceives the (0, nil) before the first line of output from the server.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nOccurs on both OS X and Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version devel +d58997478ec6 Mon Apr 08 00:09:35 2013 -0700 darwin/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nIf you uncomment the SSLConfig setting in example.go, which forces it to use RC4, the\nproblem disappears.\u003c/pre\u003e",
