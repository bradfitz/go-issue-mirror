	"body": "Quite apart from the fact that the syscall package is frozen, ioctl is a problematic system call for Go.  I think we need to handle it the way we handle setsockopt: by providing a set of functions that take different types, rather than providing a single unsafe Ioctl function.  As much as possible, we would like people to be able to use x/sys/unix without having to themselves import unsafe.",
