Thanks for the hint on the FlagSet, after\ntaking a look at the source I managed to make it work perfectly in my use-case and thus\nmy initial request makes no sense, it was just my poor knowledge of the API. Maybe some\nexamples using directly FlagSet.Parse()  and not the plain Parse() would help a little.\n\nThank you!\u003c/pre\u003e",
