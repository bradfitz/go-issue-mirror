Think I've nailed it down to the symptom:\nreq.Body.Read()\n\nYou're using io.Copy(ioutil.Discard, req.Body)\n\nHowever when I changed that to using Read(), it triggers the problem (tried raising the\nbuffer size to 2*contentLength also, but made no difference)\n   buffer := make([]byte, req.ContentLength)\n   req.Body.Read(buffer)\u003c/pre\u003e",
