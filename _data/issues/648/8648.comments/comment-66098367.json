The issue here isn't about chunked\nencoding or empty responses, but entirely about reuse of connections after a write error.\n\nBut even with the fix to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/8534\"\u003eissue #8534\u003c/a\u003e, the client/server test programs in this bug won't\ndo anything useful.\n\nLet me know if I missed something.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Duplicate**._\n\n_Merged into issue #8534._",
