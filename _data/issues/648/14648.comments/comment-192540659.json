I'm not sure about replacing what's in the suffixarray package with it, Robert is suggesting that moving from n to 2n memory use in cl/20241 is already too expensive for some uses, and divsufsort comes in at 5n.\r\n\r\nI have some other work I need to focus on, but if you end up with some code I'd be happy to try it out in the linker for you.",
