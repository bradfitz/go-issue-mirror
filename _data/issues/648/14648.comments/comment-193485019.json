Suffix arrays are certainly fairly heavy weight and known to be fairly slow (probably the reason of bzip2's decline in recent years).\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be better to try and solve the string-deduplication problem with a different approach? I was thinking an LZ77-inspired approach would possibly work. It probably won't catch as many deduplication opportunities, but will probably be significantly faster. I don't have the bandwidth currently to take this on, but it's something I can look into later.",
