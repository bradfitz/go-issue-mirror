It seems like this is where the bug is and that it should remain a non-constant byte. Looking in to a fix.\r\n\r\nEdit: After looking further into things and understanding a bit about the compile it appears that the code in cgen.go expects ```\"0\"[0]``` to have been handled by the frontend. Maybe a fix should generate code similar to the way a non-constant string is indexed? Apologies if I am off, still trying to learn the compiler code.",
