	"body": "This file has a list of constants for TLS cipher suites:\r\n\r\nhttps://golang.org/src/crypto/tls/cipher_suites.go\r\n\r\nThe list is incomplete, for example the ChaCha20-Poly1305 ciphers are missing. It would be useful to either (a) complete the list of ciphers and, or (b) document how the list of ciphers is curated.\r\n\r\nIf (a), there should also be some mechanism to keep the list up-to-date over time.\r\n",
