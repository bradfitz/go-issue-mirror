What do you see instead?\nShould be: \ntimes f1() called = 1\ntimes f1() called = 2\ntimes f1() called = 3\na1b2c3\ntimes f1() called = 4\ntimes f1() called = 5\ntimes f1() called = 6\na4b5c6\n\nGet:\ntimes f1() called = 1\ntimes f1() called = 2\ntimes f1() called = 3\na3b2c1\ntimes f1() called = 4\ntimes f1() called = 5\ntimes f1() called = 6\na4b5c6\n\nLooking at the assembly output, you can see that the function, f1(), is\ncalled left-to-right three times and the results pushed on the stack. Then\nthe results are popped off the stack and concatenated to form string s1,\nmaking it look like f1() was called right-to-left.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux, 386\n\nWhich revision are you using?
