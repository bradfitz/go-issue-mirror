If it doesn't agree with the analytic result, it's\nwrong. It's that simple. Floating points, computer implementations, they all have\nerrors. If you get the sign totally wrong for a non-zero result, then it's a problem\nwith the implementation, not mathematics.\n\nAnd let me add that acos *has* as discontinuity when passing the boundary on the\nimaginary part, so it's no revelations, and there is nothing wrong with that. See the\nplot in \"Properties \u0026 Relations\"\n\u003ca href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/ArcCosh.html\"\u003ehttp://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/ArcCosh.html\u003c/a\u003e\nfor instance.\n\nAnyway. Think/believe as you like. I tried to explain. However, it's not my\nresponsibility to get it right.\u003c/pre\u003e",
