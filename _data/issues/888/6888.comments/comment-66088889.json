But it appears that it's not the case here.\n\nFor \"normal\" domain, we (normally) have\n\u003e\u003e\u003e cmath.acos(0.5)\n(1.0471975511965979-0j)\n\nbut...\n\u003e\u003e\u003e cmath.acos(2)\n-1.3169578969248166j\nwhoops, we suddenly got an extra minus here.\n\nI don't think there is no such thing as \"predated work that later became standard\npractice\", it's mostly like just people copying each other's code.\n\nOf course, the answer is not wrong (cos is an even function). But there is an\ninconsistency.\n\nMathematica is consistent overall.\u003c/pre\u003e",
