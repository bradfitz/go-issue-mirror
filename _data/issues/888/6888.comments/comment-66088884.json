Furthermore, c99\nhas a definition of how these functions are supposed to behave.  If we believe what is\nclaimed in the cephes documentation, we should observe that behavior too.\n\nMathematica is a different computing environment from either Go or C.  Trivially, it\ndoes not use hardware floats and it probably does not have a notion of a signed zero. \nBoth of these features are important as far as the implementation of the complex\nelementary functions and their branch cuts are concerned.  More fundamentally, its\nimplementation decisions likely predated work that later became standard practice\n\nFor example\n\n$ python\nPython 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) \n[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e import cmath\n\u003e\u003e\u003e cmath.acos(2)\n-1.3169578969248166j\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
