That \"branch choice\" is well-established since more than 100 years ago.\nsqrt(-1) is *the* definition of i in mathematics. That log expression itself is written\nwith that definition in mind.\n\nAnd even if you're living in an alternate universe where i is -sqrt(-1), you must stick\nwith that definition from the beginning to the end.\n\nIn general, asin expansion given there is OK. You should be careful when combining\nsquare roots when using complex numbers however, see\n\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_hyperbolic_function#Logarithmic_representation\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_hyperbolic_function#Logarithmic_representation\u003c/a\u003e\nfor a note related to acos (acosh there).\n\nThe math is known, it's all analytic, and there is no need to involve anything computer\nspecific here.\n\nAnyway, I don't understand the resistance here, and I'm already tired about discussing\non well-known simple elementary math. I find it pointless to further trying to convince\nyou. As a final note, just let me say that Wolfram probably knows math better than you,\nand if python/libc/you/whatever disagrees with Mathematica on the output of an\nelementary function, it's mostly likely that Mathematica is correct. Good day.\u003c/pre\u003e",
