This, as\nwell as the unused variable errors, should not be errors.  The compiler should be smart\nenough to strip these out and compile the program anyway, since it makes exploratory\ndebugging much easier.  There is really no reason for the compiler to be so picky.  It\ncan issue warnings.\n\nAnd it full on stops even in situations when it is wrong, like this one.  That's\nespecially frustrating.\n\nI find this code to be more consistent and readable than the other:\n \n    if x == 0 {\n        return 5;\n    } else {\n        return x;\n    }\u003c/pre\u003e",
