	"body": "Hi,\r\nI think it could be useful to have at least three new methods in the log package:\r\n- AsyncPrint(v ...interface{})\r\n- AsyncPrintf(format string, v ...interface{})\r\n- AsyncPrintln(v ...interface{})\r\n\r\nthese methods should produce the same output of the respective synchronous methods, but the operations will be performed in a separated goroutine.\r\n\r\nThe same methods should also be added to the Logger type.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of these methods can be realized using a buffered channel in which messages to be logged are written and a consumer goroutine reads the requests and write the logs. The maximum limit of requests in the buffer should be configurable.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMassimo\r\n\r\n\r\n",
