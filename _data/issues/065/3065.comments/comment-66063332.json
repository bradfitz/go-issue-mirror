It looks like the only time you'd notice the\ndifference between GetenvError and Getenv is if you pass an empty key, or if you want to\ndistinguish an unset environment variable from an empty-but-set one. The former case is\ntrivially checkable from callers; the latter case can either use syscall.Getenv\ndirectly, or use os.Environ and parse/iterate themselves.\n\nJust my 2Â¢.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-go1**, removed **priority-triage**._",
