The problem is that `ii` is not grouped with other bss symbols.\r\n\r\nSee https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/UVBznzrj5S4 for much more discussion.\r\n\r\nPossible fixes include (1) somehow getting the linked symbols organized correctly and (2) teaching the race detector to find all C symbols.\r\n\r\nI'll send a CL with a disabled failing test shortly. I'd love help fixing this. I'm not even sure where to start.\r\n\r\ncc @crawshaw @ianlancetaylor @mwhudson @dvyukov \r\n",
