A proof of concept outside the standard library would be a requirement to adding anything to the standard library anyway.\r\n\r\nLet's move this discussion to a forum (see https://golang.org/wiki/Questions) for now, though, because I imagine this has come up before.\r\n\r\nIf the golang-nuts@ thread yields any new info, the summary of that information can be posted here and we can reconsider.",
