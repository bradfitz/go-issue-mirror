	"body": "This bug is pretty undefined.\r\n\r\n@devnev, can you explicitly describe what you want to see here, being more explicit than \"implementation of the HTTP2 spec's shutdown behaviour\"?\r\n\r\nNote that we already have #4674 open to track Server's graceful shutdown. That applies to HTTP/1 and HTTP/2. The details differ, but not much.\r\n\r\nWe don't plan on adding API around the http2.Transport sending GOAWAY frames. There's no real reason for a client to send GOAWAY. Even gRPC doesn't seem to care, considering that https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/460 is still open. We already have Transport.CloseIdleConnections, and https://golang.org/cl/30076 to do graceful shutdown of Transport connections.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this until I know what this bug is about.\r\n",
