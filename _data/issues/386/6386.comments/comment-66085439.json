If it would have to have constant semantics then its run time costs\nare the same as today, only hidden.\n\n        const c = []byte{1}\n        a := c\n        a[0] = 42\n        b := c\n        fmt.Println(b[0] == 1)\n\nThe above can print 'true' only if the c's backing array is copied in assignment to 'a',\nhowever the const declaration gives an illusion of always using the same backing array -\nlike is the case of a string's backing array.\n\nIOW: 1. nothing is gained by const []T and 2. run time costs get hidden and thus\npotentially confusing.\u003c/pre\u003e",
