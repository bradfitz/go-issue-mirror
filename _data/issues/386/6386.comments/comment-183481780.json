To have a chance of even just being considered, there would need to be a full proposal together with a detailed analysis of cost and benefit.\r\n\r\nIn this specific case, extending the concept of constants to other than just basic types would be a significant change with all kinds of repercussions. I like to add also to the comment in the initial issue report that the current situation is _not_ a \"defect\" in the spec - it was conceived as is pretty much from day one, for very good reasons.\r\n\r\nLeaving open for a future Go 2 if there will ever be one.\r\n",
