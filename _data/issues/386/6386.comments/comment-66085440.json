This should be sufficiently const that it could, in the right environment, go into\nrom or the code segment.  That is, be immutable, ideally.\n\n2. I should be able to type it without getting RSI from repeating '[]byte' for every\nword.\n\n3. For byte structures like this, it isn't absolutely necessary that we would be allowed\nto enter arbitrary runes, although that would be technically feasible, and useful. \nEspecially for those who aren't English-language programmers.  And it would be\nconsistent with the rest of Go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
