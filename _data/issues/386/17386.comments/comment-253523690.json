Another point which I can't shirk is that I need to compare one user's name with hundreds/thousands of other names very often (at the moment accomplished by looking it up as part of a map).\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I'd very much enjoy being able to get the canonical/key/casefolded version of a given string somehow, and this would make me very happy indeed. Thanks for your work on this cool language :)",
