I'm not saying we copy the solution there, as I'm not entirely happy with it, but we could copy the terminology, where it is called Key.\r\nSo something like CompareKey or Fold, rather than canonical would make more sense. \r\nat the very least, I would not go overboard with growing the API surface too much. Maybe just having a AppendCompareKey() or the like is sufficient. But haven't given it too much thought.",
