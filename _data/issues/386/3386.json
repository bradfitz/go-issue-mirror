	"body": "by **trolleriprofessorn**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe current godoc server (baeb068aac25+ tip) generates directory listings on startup and\ndon't update them on reload. This is inconvenient when you use the server to browse the\ndocumentation of your project during development.\n\nIf it's not possible to address this before the Go 1 release, I suggest making the\n-timestamps flag true by default. This will help new users discover the behavior and\nexperienced users can easily turn timestamps off.\u003c/pre\u003e",
