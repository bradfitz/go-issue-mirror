I'll guess that the answer of which source tool needs speed improvements differ depending on who uses what often. \r\n\r\nBtw, It's probably better to have separate ignore files per tool for flexibility, one can always use symlinks to use a single file if the format is the same.\r\n\r\n(and... thanks for the very much speedier goimports)",
