The function's name is __ieee754_rem_pio2.\n\nPorting __ieee754_rem_pio2 (and __kernel_rem_pio2 called by it) over should be\nsufficient to fix this issue.\n\nThen there are routines __kernel_cos(r, dr) that assume these conditions on r and dr and\ndon't have to worry about r being too large.\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/k_cos.c\"\u003ehttp://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/k_cos.c\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
