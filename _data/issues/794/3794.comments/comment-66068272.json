If there were never any\nunquoting to do, then maybe we could treat the input as uninterpreted 8-bit ASCI++\n(let's call it Latin-1). However, when we see \u0026#xFF; (a code point 0xFF) we need to know\nhow to turn that into a byte sequence in the encoding of the surrounding document. If we\naccept Latin-1 in the surrounding document but assume UTF-8 here (as we really must),\nyou'll end up with hybrid output that is part Latin-1 and part-UTF-8.\n\nIf you want an accurate conversion, you really do need to do the Latin-1 to UTF-8 and\nback in the calling code.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
