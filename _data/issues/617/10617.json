	"body": "https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/DashboardBuilders is manually maintained and sometimes goes stale.\r\n\r\nI think we should move the descriptions of all new-style coordinator-managed builders into dashboard/builders.go (into a new description field) and then add a new URL like:\r\n\r\n   http://farmer.golang.org/buildertypes\r\n\r\n... which lists them.\r\n\r\nThen the wiki page can link to /buildertypes primarily and have a much smaller augmented list, which will eventually be zero.\r\n\r\n/cc @crawshaw ",
