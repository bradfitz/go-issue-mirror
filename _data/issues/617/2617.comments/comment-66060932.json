There should probably be a Group type, with the group name, group ID, and a\nuser list.  LookupGroupId would take a group ID and return the group information.\n\nWe should also have a function to return the list of groups for a user.\n\nThis would have to work for Windows also.  I have no idea what groups look like on\nWindows.\u003c/pre\u003e",
