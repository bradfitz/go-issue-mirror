My suspicion is the\nnumber would be quite small, so this patch would turn out to be a net positive for\nalmost all compilations.\n\nRe: sharing *Mpints, I did a very quick summary of the different numbers in tables.go\n(see attached), and while there is a lot of duplication, there are close to 200k lines\nin the file, unless sharing an Mpint cost very little, I don't think this would save\nmemory, or time.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4617/3/tables.txt\"\u003etables.txt\u003c/a\u003e (3503457 bytes)",
