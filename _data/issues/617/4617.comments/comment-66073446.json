There\nare no NaNs.\n\nTwo possibilities that come to mind:\n\n1) Add a new val.ctype = CTINT64 and add a int64 field to the val union. Make sure that\nCTINT is only ever used for values that do not fit in an int64.\n\n2) In lex.c, at the ncu: label, before allocating an mpint, look in a hash table (can\nreuse lookup probably) to see if we've seen this number before, and if so, reuse the\nMpint from the last time.  (They are not modified once craeted.)\n\nI think (1) is more work but will end up significantly cleaner and more robust. I think\n(2) is a small amount of work but might introduce subtle bugs and may not work at all.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
