As far as I can tell heapBitsSetType can be invoked in parallel regardless of the setting of gcphase, and it's possible, albeit very unlikely, for two different threads to collide on the bitmap when allocating memory.  In fact I don't see what gcphase has to do with anything in heapBitsSetType at all, since it's only called from mallocgc.  It seems to me that that should be either always safe, or never safe, regardless of what the GC is doing.  What am I missing?",
