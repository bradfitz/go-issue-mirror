	"body": "The issue here is that map code is broken for value = struct{}. In general things do work fine with struct{}. For example new(struct{}) is fine. Map code is the exception here, maps with struct{} values are very common, and we need a simple, targeted fix for this specific problem for Go 1.4.1.\r\n\r\nIt is true that if you have a non-zero-size struct type that has a final zero-sized field, taking the address of that field can give you a pointer beyond the allocation. That's really a separate issue and is a much less common case. Please discuss this more general problem on #9401 and leave this issue for the map problem.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
