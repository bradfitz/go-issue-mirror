Encoding integer values\nbelow 2^53 as integers would probably help the common case but just push off the\nsurprise from 1e6 to a higher value.  Given json.Number, maybe the right way to go about\nthis is to always encode float64 with a decimal point so that JSON parsers never\ninterpret the values as integers.  It is slightly more inconvenient, but it would\ninvolve the least surprise when your program happens to get to large integer values\n(where \"large\" is either 1e6 or 2^53).\n\nIt would probably also be good to make this more explicit in the documentation.\u003c/pre\u003e",
