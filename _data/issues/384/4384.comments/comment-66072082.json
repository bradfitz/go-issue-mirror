Linux counts # of ESTABLISHED incoming sockets as backlog.\n\ncf. tcp_v4_conn_request in net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c:\n        /* Accept backlog is full. If we have already queued enough\n         * of warm entries in syn queue, drop request. It is better than\n         * clogging syn queue with openreqs with exponentially increasing\n         * timeout.\n         */\n        if (sk_acceptq_is_full(sk) \u0026\u0026 inet_csk_reqsk_queue_young(sk) \u003e 1)\n                goto drop;\n\nOther BSDs doesn't, it counts both SYN-SENT and ESTABs.\nNot sure for Windows.\n\n\nQ. Why we're able to connect more than SOMAXCONN on Linux?\n\nA. Because latest Linux on multicare/SMP works great on lock-contention!?\nHi fullung, which kernel version are you using?\nI failed to repro the issue on 3.2.0-32-generic Ubuntu.\u003c/pre\u003e",
