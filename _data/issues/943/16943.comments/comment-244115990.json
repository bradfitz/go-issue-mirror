	"body": "SGTM. Line numbers have never been sacrosanct; preserving the quirks of existing behavior is not a priority. Matching gccgo would be a nice bonus.\r\n\r\nI'm curious how well the SSA handling of line numbers preserves your rules.\r\n\r\nOne small data point I'd like to see is binary size before/after. The pclntab is the single largest component of binaries, and its size is tied directly to line-numbering decisions in the compiler. I don't expect much change, but it'd be good to keep an eye on it.\r\n",
