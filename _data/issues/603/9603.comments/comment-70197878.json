Then again, it's likely freetype\nwill move soonish. (right @nigeltao?)\n\n\u003e\n\u003e    - darwin builders: missing OpenGL/gl3.h, CoreText/CTFont.h : Need for\n\u003e    a special darwin builder with necessary libraries installed?\n\u003e\n\u003e That can also be arranged.\n\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e One option is to exclude mobile subrepo entirely by default. But I don't\n\u003e want to avoid it if possible. There are some packages and tools (eg.\n\u003e gobind?) that should work without the platform/library dependencies.\n\u003e\nIt should definitely be tested. If we decide we don't want the go builders\nto do it, then maybe we could use Travis CI? But I would prefer to just\nmake it work in the go build infrastructure.\n\n(cc @bradfitz)",
