In general you can't do anything between fork and exec without\nlots of care, especially in the presence of other threads.\n\nFor your case: you can exec a program to set the rlimit, and then have that program exec\nthe final binary.\n\nIt's possible we could add some rlimit-like stuff to exec.Cmd.SysProcAttr\n(*syscall.SysProcAttr) but it seems unlikely.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
