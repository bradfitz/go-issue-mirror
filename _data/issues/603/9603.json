	"body": "build status of mobile subrepo never looks good in build.golang.org\r\nThat's mostly because some code in mobile repo has exernal package/library dependency.\r\n\r\n- some builders complain lack of 'hg' tool, for go get code.google.com/p/freetype-go/freetype\r\n  : Should we require the builders to have 'hg' tool?\r\n- some packages work only on darwin/linux. (app,gl,font, ..)\r\n  : Need proper build tags.\r\n- darwin builders: missing OpenGL/gl3.h, CoreText/CTFont.h\r\n  : Need for a special darwin builder with necessary libraries installed?\r\n\r\nOne option is to exclude mobile subrepo entirely by default. But I don't want to avoid it if possible. There are some packages and tools (eg. gobind?) that should work without the platform/library dependencies.",
