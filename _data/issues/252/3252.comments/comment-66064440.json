When using data descriptors (which the command-line zip tool doesn't write,\neven in streaming mode to stdout!), we need to use the unofficial header for them.\n\nThe spec says:\n\n      Although not originally assigned a signature, the value \n      0x08074b50 has commonly been adopted as a signature value \n      for the data descriptor record.  Implementers should be \n      aware that ZIP files may be encountered with or without this \n      signature marking data descriptors and should account for\n      either case when reading ZIP files to ensure compatibility.\n      When writing ZIP files, it is recommended to include the\n      signature value marking the data descriptor record.  When\n      the signature is used, the fields currently defined for\n      the data descriptor record will immediately follow the\n      signature.\n\n\nI verified that this change to archive/zip writer.go fixes it, and Finder can open the\nzips then:\n\n        // write data descriptor                                                                                                               \n        var buf [dataDescriptorLen + 4]byte\n        b := writeBuf(buf[:])\n\tb.uint32(0x08074b50)\u003c/pre\u003e",
