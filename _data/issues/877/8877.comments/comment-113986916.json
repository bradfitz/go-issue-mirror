The proper way to do DNS on Android is to ask the local DNS proxy cache on the device for it, but that necessarily involves Binder calls and whatnot, and the details of how aren't a public interface AFAIU. (as least they weren't awhile ago).\r\n\r\nThe number of cases where you'd want a Go binary to do its own DNS lookups is rare. In those cases, we can do the whole getprop thing I suppose, but I'm not even sure I understand the advantages to not using cgo once our toolchain and linker are happier with Android stuff.\r\n",
