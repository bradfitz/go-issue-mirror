	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIt would be nice if RUnlock() panicked if called when the mutex is not read locked,\nsimilar to how Unlock() panics when the mutex is not write locked. As it is, bugs\nrelated to mismatched rlocking are harder to find. The documentation states that\n\u0026quot;It is a run-time error if rw is not locked for reading on entry to RUnlock.\u0026quot;\nwhich I interpret as we intended this to panic.\n\nGo v1.2.1\n\nThe program:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/GmAqwC5WJo\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/GmAqwC5WJo\u003c/a\u003e\n\nNow prints:\n\nRead locked\nAlso, write locked\n\nWhile I would expect it to panic on line 10.\u003c/pre\u003e",
