We've all been so focused on the Go 1.6 dashboard and nobody triaged this for a few days when it came in (oh, Dec 29th), dooming it.\r\n\r\nI made a demo here: http://play.golang.org/p/aGv7ijAOx_\r\n\r\nIn summary, CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey is currently basically this (simplifed):\r\n\r\n```go\r\n    func CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey(s string) {\r\n        if strings.Contains(s, \"_\") { // or other bogus stuff\r\n             return s\r\n        }\r\n        // else actually canonicalize it....\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think we should probably add underscore as an allowed byte. We'd just not mess with the case of the following the byte like we do for hyphen.\r\n\r\n/cc @rsc \r\n\r\nMaybe this can still be Go 1.6 material?",
