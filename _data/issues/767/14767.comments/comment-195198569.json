	"body": "In general fork does not work with multi-threaded processes, and Go programs are always multi-threaded.  A simple fork/exec that does not call any Go code between fork and exec should work.  An attempt to call Go code after fork will generally fail, as you are seeing.\r\n\r\nThere is really no way to fix this, so I am going to close this issue.  If you want to discuss this, please use a forum, not the issue tracker; see https://golang.org/wiki/Questions.",
