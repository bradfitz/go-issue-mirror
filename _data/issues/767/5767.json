This yield true especially since Dan\nKaminski's dns vulnerability discovery.\n\nFor the source port, net seems to depend on the kernel's source port randomization where\nI'm not sure if they are unpredictable or whether go should explicitly generate a\nrandom, unpredictable port as well.\n\nAttached is a naive fix, replacing math/rand by crypto/rand. I'm happy for suggestions\nin case there is a better way to fix it.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5767/0/replace-math-rand-by-crypto-rand-for-dns-id.patch\"\u003ereplace-math-rand-by-crypto-rand-for-dns-id.patch\u003c/a\u003e (1312 bytes)",
