It's been like this for ages.\n\nThe http client ultimately uses net/url.Parse which unescapes the path.\n\nThe workaround has been documented at \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/net/url/#URL\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/pkg/net/url/#URL\u003c/a\u003e but not on\nurl.Parse, nor on http.Get and friends.\n\nPerhaps we need a new url.ParseRaw or something which is documented to guarantee to\nround-trip (String-\u003eParse-\u003eString), parsing into the url.Opaque field as needed to\npreserve the guarantee.\n\nThen we can adjust net/http to use url.ParseRaw instead.\n\nAssigning to Russ for his opinion, and he can assign back to me to implement if desired.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @rsc._",
