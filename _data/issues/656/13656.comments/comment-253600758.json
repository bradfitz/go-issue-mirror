I could see possibly adding something like unsafe.Slice(p, n, m) with the right types (p is pointer to T, result is []T). That would be a language change.\r\n\r\nI guess we could add reflect.UnsafeSlice(t, p, n, m) to return an interface{} or a Value holding a slice of type t with pointer p, len n, cap m. It's not really reflect but maybe it's fine. I guess it's more reflect than Swapper, although that's not a great argument.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't mind writing `*(*[1\u003c\u003c30]T)(unsafe.Pointer(p))[:n:m]`.",
