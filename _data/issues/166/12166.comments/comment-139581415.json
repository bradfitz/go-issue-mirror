I have test code that could be improved with the use of the proposed features.\r\n\r\nI find the discussion of subbenchmarks in the proposal somewhat lacking in context. The example refers to variables `allMethods` and `smallSet` that are not shown, which makes it difficult to understand what the example code really does.\r\n\r\nI would like to see some discussion of how subtests can be accomplished with the existing testing package. How far can we get without this proposal? I have some idea from my own experience, but I think the proposal should make the comparison more directly.\r\n\r\nIn short, I like what I see, but we should be thorough.",
