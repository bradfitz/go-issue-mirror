Sometimes you want your XML to be human readable, and encoding \", ',\n\\\\, \\n and \\t as entities effectively prevents that.\n\nAlso, I don't see any reason at all why they should be encoded, except in attribute\nvalues. Perhaps I should file another issue, titled \"do not encode anything that needs\nnot to be encoded\".\n\n\u003e It should be possible to do this in the program by having the XML code write to a\nWriter that translates the byte sequences where appropriate.\n\nThere is a simpler and more efficient way - to fork the code and amend it. I don't want\nto go for it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
