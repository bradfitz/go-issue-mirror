If it doesn't do that now, it can't start. People surely depend on\nnew(struct{}) != new(struct{}). \n\nSlices are a special case because we dropped == on slices and you also can't take a\npointer to an element since there are no elements. Roger's suggestion of not letting the\ncompiler rewrite make into new in these cases seems to me the right one.\u003c/pre\u003e",
