	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIn tip, there's support for using SWIG through the build tool. This works actually\nreally well now, but one problem is that if one wishes to pass compiler options to the\nC/C++ compiler, none of the flags supported by the build tool seem to support that. \n\nAn example workaround is to run:\n\n    \u0026quot;CC=gcc \u0026lt;flag1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;flag2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;flag3\u0026gt;\u0026quot; go build\n\nbut it's rather awkward. Something similar how Cgo handles compiler flags, perhaps.\u003c/pre\u003e",
