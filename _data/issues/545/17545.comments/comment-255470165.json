	"body": "First, I suggest that you not care about a failure in the time package when building Go 1.4 solely in order to build a later version of Go.  A test failure of that sort doesn't matter.  Don't worry about it.\r\n\r\nSecond, I'm afraid that I simply don't believe that your 1.4 sources built before you applied the change in https://golang.org/cl/29995 but then failed to build in the way that you describe after you applied that change.  That change could not cause that failure.  Either that failure existed before you applied that change, or you changed more than just that one file.",
