	"body": "\u003e First, I suggest that you not care about a failure in the time package when building Go 1.4 solely in order to build a later version of Go. A test failure of that sort doesn't matter. Don't worry about it.\r\n\r\nThanks for the advice. We'll skip that test.\r\n\r\n\u003e Second, I'm afraid that I simply don't believe that your 1.4 sources built before you applied the change in https://golang.org/cl/29995 but then failed to build in the way that you describe after you applied that change. That change could not cause that failure. Either that failure existed before you applied that change, or you changed more than just that one file.\r\n\r\nIntriguing.\r\n\r\nOur packaging [0] alters the Go sources in these ways:\r\n1. Delete some tests that require networking, which is not available in the Guix build environment.\r\n2. Disable some other tests that all seem to be related to Unix shell operations. I didn't make that part of the packaging, so I don't know off-hand how they fail.\r\n3. Patch paths to a variety of dependencies.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid that I'm simply not a Go programmer, so I can't say if these changes would cause the failure in question when combined with the fix for https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17276.\r\n\r\nHowever, our 1.4.3 package does successfully bootstrap 1.7.1 and 1.7.3, which I do use to build working Go applications.\r\n \r\n[0] If you see anything amiss, I'd be very glad if you told us.\r\nhttp://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/gnu/packages/golang.scm?h=core-updates\u0026id=f08add0c5a3f1f7200b0a00e17ed880692d2244b#n47\r\n",
