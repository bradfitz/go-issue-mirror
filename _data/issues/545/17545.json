That is, the name of the time zone used in the test has changed in tzdata 2016g. However, the fix suggested in that ticket does not work for 1.4.3. When I apply the patch that fixes the bug for the 1.7 release series, compilation fails like this:\r\n```\r\n # Building C bootstrap tool.\r\ncmd/dist\r\n\r\n# Building compilers and Go bootstrap tool for host, linux/amd64.\r\nlib9\r\ngo tool dist: missing file /tmp/guix-build-go-1.4.3.drv-0/go/include/fmt.h\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nA successful test suite.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\nA failure of TestLoadFixed.\r\n\r\nWhat do you suggest for distributions that use Go 1.4.3 to bootstrap later versions of Go?",
