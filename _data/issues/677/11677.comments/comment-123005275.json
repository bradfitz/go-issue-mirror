It shouldn't be possible to miss by that much. We're probably mis-accounting something. We spent less than a microsecond in assists (probably we spent no time in assists), which should have acted as the back-pressure against the heap going this far past the goal.\r\n\r\nAnother odd thing here is that the duration of the mark phase was 7.4 ms, but we only spent 1.46 ms of CPU time in GC during that phase. Those times are small enough that it's possible it's just scheduling noise delaying the start of the mark workers (from the OS, the runtime, or both), but that shouldn't impact assists.",
