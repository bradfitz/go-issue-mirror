We don't enable assists until the concurrent mark phase, which means there's some time between when we hit the GC trigger heap size and when we finish the scan phase and go in to mark during which the mutator can continue to allocate without back-pressure. With my prototype fix for the \"no work\" problem, I see that when we still go over the heap goal, we're over by exactly the amount that was allocated between the GC trigger and the beginning of concurrent mark.",
