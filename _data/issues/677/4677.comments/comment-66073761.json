For desktop, you can be wasteful and use TCP keepalives to mitigate this too.\nFor mobile, it wakes up the radio and maybe costs money, so you shouldn't do that and\njust deal with it. We close persistent connections after a fixed period to minimize the\ntimes we get these errors. For mobile, we do deferred socket closes (wait for the radio\nto wakeup due to other HTTP requests, and then close all timed out sockets).\n* If you pipeline requests and get a transport error, we pray that HEADs and GETs are\nactually idempotent and retry.\u003c/pre\u003e",
