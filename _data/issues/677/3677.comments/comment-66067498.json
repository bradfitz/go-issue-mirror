You can\nchange this under \"Tools\", \"Internet Options...\", \"Advanced\", (scroll to the bottom),\nuncheck \"Use SSL 2.0\" and check \"Use SSL 3.0\" and \"Use TLS 1.0\".\n\nOn a wider note: if you're running a secure, production server with Go then terminating\nthe SSL connections with something else is probably a good idea. The Go TLS stack has\nbeen substantially written by me and hasn't received any of the security review that\nsomething like OpenSSL has. OpenSSL and the like will also use less CPU and include all\nthe quirks needed to support browsers like IE6.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
