I'd like to remove the current requirement to have dedicated temporary registers and it will be cleaner to do this once the old backend is gone.\r\n\r\nI think everybody wants to see the old backend deleted straight away for similar ease-of-cleanups reasons. Having two backends makes things trickier everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
