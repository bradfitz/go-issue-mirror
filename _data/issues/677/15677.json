	"body": "I'm writing a toolexec-able program for which I want to know the full package path for whatever code is being operated on. The code to figure out this package path is currently a pile of hacks. E.g. for compile, look for the `-p` arg. For asm, use `-trimpath` to figure out $WORK and then slice that off the `-o` arg. This breaks down entirely for invocations of cgo with `-dynpackage`.\r\n\r\nI would like to have cmd/go pass extra information when toolexec is in use. For backwards compatibility, I propose to do this via an environment variable, something like `TOOLEXEC_PKG_PATH` (improvements welcome). There might be other, similar bits of data to add in the future.\r\n\r\nFeedback and suggestions requested. I'm going to hack this in myself anyway, it's just a question of whether I should plan to mail a CL at the end (for 1.8, of course).\r\n",
