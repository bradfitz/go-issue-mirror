The gc toolchain expects\nthat the struct and function argument frame alignments match. The stack frame \nbarely matters, since we don't take pointers of stack variables anymore, but that's\nhard too.\n\nThis only really matters for atomics, and we do guarantee 64-bit alignment for the\nbase of an allocated struct or slice, so that will have to be good enough for now.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-someday**, removed **priority-soon**, **go1.1**._",
