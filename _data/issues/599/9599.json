	"body": "I think the basic functionality should work with ssh-based gerrit access.\r\n\r\nIt seems we only use gerrit api for submit, but not many people can use\r\ngit submit anyway.\r\n\r\nPS: I think gerrit also support ssh based API too.\r\n\r\nBackground: I set up a Gerrit instance for some Go localization projects.\r\nas I'm using the github plugin and use Github OAuth to authenticate\r\nhttps, it's not possible to support https-based Gerrit API access with\r\npassword (it seems once the github plugin is enabled, all https login\r\nrequests will be forwarded to github.)\r\nHowever, ssh should work fine, and Gerrit supports SSH public key.\r\n",
