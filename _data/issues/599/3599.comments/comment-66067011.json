I have used nate's npipe package for quite some time now. It works well and is\nvery robust in my experience.\n\nAs this is a Windows only feature, I'm doubtful it belongs in the standard repo. Perhaps\nin net sub-repo at best? I for one am fine with it as a go-gettable package, though I'd\nhate to see it disappear if nate did.\n\nI would vote to just recognize the status quo and close the issue. Get this feature\nfrom: gopkg.in/natefinch/npipe.v2\n.\u003c/pre\u003e",
