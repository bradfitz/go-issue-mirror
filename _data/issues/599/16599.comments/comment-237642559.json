Makes sense, and since SIGKILL nor SIGSTOP cannot be stopped, we don't have a way for go run to catch this signal and then kill its children.\r\nFor those that need a way to kill these zombies `lsof -i :\u003cPORT\u003e`\r\n```shell\r\n$ lsof -i :4567 | awk '{ print $2 }'\r\n$ # Then find the PID and kill it with -9 e.g\r\n$ lsof -i :4321 | awk '{ print $2 }' | awk 'if ($2 ~ /[0-9 { print $1 }' | while read F;do kill -9 $F;done\r\n```\r\nUnless @bradfitz or @ianlancetaylor think something else can be done, then this is working as intended.",
