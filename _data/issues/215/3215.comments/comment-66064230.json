Windows\ninstallation instructions (currently entirely missing) should definitely mention how to\nset ENV (temporarily or permanently) because that varies a bit depending on which\nversion of m$win you're using.\n\nWas surprised that speed of sample project build was still sub-second on this midrange\nnotebook.
