The 'run'\nfor the hello world program does not work.  I get a 'Error communicating with remote\nserver.' on the page and in the DOS box I see:\n\n2012/03/06 20:48:05 GetFileAttributesEx c:\\go\\compile: The system cannot find th\ne file specified.\n\nClose browser, and DOS box hangs.\n\n3) Write hello.go, and 'go build'.  I get an executable named 'hello'.  I had to rename\nit to 'hello.exe' for it to run.\n\n4) Uninstall works: C:\\go is gone, and the shortcut is gone.\n\n5) Second install looks clean.\n\n6) Set 'GOPATH' and put the hello.go program in %GOPATH%\\src\\hello.  Then 'go install\nhello' works.  This time I do get 'hello.exe' in %GOPATH%\\bin.\n\n7) Same no 'hg' observation as described above.  Ditto 'git'.  I tried to alleviate this\nby sticking c:\\cygwin\\bin in %path%.  Same result for 'hg'.  'git' tries but eventually\ndies with:\n\n    \u003ca href=\"http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using.html#using-pathnames\"\u003ehttp://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using.html#using-pathnames\u003c/a\u003e\nCloning into C:\\Users\\gmallard\\Documents\\gowintest\\src\\github.com\\gmallard\\stomp\nngo...\n    137 [main] git-remote-https 3872 child_info_fork::abort: data segment start:\n parent(0x3C5000) != child(0x5E5000)\nerror: cannot fork() for fetch-pack: Resource temporarily unavailable\n\n8) Second uninstall is also clean\n\n9) Third install is clean\n\nGeneral comments:\n\nI can probably obtain a native 'hg' install ..... Tortoise maybe.\n\n'git' .... not sure.  Maybe Msysgit.  I have never used it.\n\nI am an habitual Cygwin user for *Nix functionality on Win.  I do not mind flip/flopping\nbetween DOS and Cygwin command lines, but that is not going to work very well (if at\nall) in this case.\u003c/pre\u003e",
