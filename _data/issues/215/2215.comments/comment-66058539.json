This will\nalso present a new public net.LookupProtocol() function, which will invoke\ngetprotobyname. I prefer to use the reentrant version on Unix -\ngetprotobyname_r, however this is technically not POSIX. It works on Linux\nand I suspect it will work on the other Unixes supported by go, since it was\nin the original BSD, however I don't have easy access to those platforms to\ntest on. Please let me know if you think that using getprotobyname_r would\nget the patch rejected.\n\nI will also add the relevant tests. I fear the patchset may look a little\nlarge but I want to do it right.\u003c/pre\u003e",
