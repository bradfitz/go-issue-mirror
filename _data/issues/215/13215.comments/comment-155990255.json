	"body": "Indeed.  Unfortunately, this is tricky.  Perm also side-effects r, and making this change will affect the final state of r.  I don't think we can do that for compatibility reasons.\r\nYou could start the loop at 1 and call r.Intn(1) (or Int63()) before the loop.  Then add a big comment as to why that call is there and that we should remove it for Go 2.\r\n\r\nToo bad Intn(1) wasn't originally coded to do the n==1 shortcut.\r\n\r\nCare to make a patch?\r\n",
