For example, ppc64le requires a much more recent kernel, and I\nremember we also require a very recent kernel for the s390x port (due to a\nkernel bug exposed by Go.)\n\nIf we do document the minimum linux kernel for each architecture, it makes\nsense to have a builder at that version to catch regressions. I think it's\nhighly unlikely that all.bash could actually pass on 2.6.23 today.\n",
