The current document provides a summary of the syntax and the differences with what is explained in that document, and describes the peculiarities that apply when writing assembly code to interact with Go. \"\r\n\r\nSo until someone suggests a replacement (and a better way to contribute to the website) this part of Go's implementation is now missing documentation.",
