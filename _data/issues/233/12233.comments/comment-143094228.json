	"body": "@rowland, I don't see why the panic you pasted is related to this issue. It looks like a NULL pointer dereference in C code. That would also support why go tool addr2line isn't working, since that only reads Go line tables. You could try just \"addr2line -fipe talent-search 0x403750\" (not the go tool). Or, if that doesn't work, use \"nm -n talent-search\" and find the function that contains 0x403750.",
