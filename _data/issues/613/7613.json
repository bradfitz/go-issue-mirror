	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eInclusion of images that require resizing but need to maintain the original aspect ratio\nwould be greatly simplified if only a single dimension were requires in a .image\ndirective.\n\nThis bug is a proposal to alter the .image directive to allow a single underscore for a\ndimension that can be calculated from the remaining given dimension and the dimensions\nof the image. e.g.\n\n.image images/foo.jpg _ 600 # 600 pixel wide jpg with aspect ratio of original.\n\n(As an aside, why does height (y) precede width (x)?).\n\nFrom reading the template as it stands, this can be achieved as a workaround by\nspecifying a 0 width or height, but an underscore lends readability to the source. The\nCL would just be to parseArgs to parse a field == \u0026quot;_\u0026quot; as int(0).\u003c/pre\u003e",
