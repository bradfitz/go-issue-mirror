I want the instructions that shift a 64 bit register right/left, but shift in\nbits from another register rather than zeros.\n\nIt turns out this is stupidity on my part. Looking at the code in\nmath/big/arith_amd64.s, I see that double precision shifts are handled like:\n\nSHLQ CX, DX:AX\n\nand that I was erroneously assuming that I should use the Intel instruction names. Sorry\nfor the noise, and please feel free to close this issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
