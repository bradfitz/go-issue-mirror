	"body": "@bradfitz Oh yes, host.go. I'll describe what was going on in depth and we can take it from there:\r\n\r\nI was goofing around with git-http-backend (git ends up using chunked requests) and ran into issues using `net/http/cgi`, but noticed that in most other servers like Apache the request chunking gets handled transparently when passed to CGI scripts. While troubleshooting that some I noticed that the request body was a `chunkedWriter` and the docs seemed to say that it would handle chunked requests transparently, so I pulled the host.go file over, ripped that conditional out, and tested it, and it seemed to work fine in this instance.\r\n\r\nI took a quick stab at getting a patch over to you guys, but simply ran out of time and figured it'd make more sense to mention it here in case anyone could fix it more quickly than I can. It looks like host_test.go will need some updates as well to cover the fact that chunking would be supported as well.",
