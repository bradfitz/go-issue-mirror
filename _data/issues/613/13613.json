	"body": "Hi.\r\n\r\nruntime.ReadMemStats() calls stopTheWorld inside(), so it is very expensive to call it often (see https://github.com/mkevac/debugcharts). Especially in a production system.\r\n\r\nI would like to see cheaper but maybe not so accurate alternative if it's possible.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
