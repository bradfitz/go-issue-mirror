	"title": "go/types: function call has invalid type just because an argument is undefined",
	"body": "For a function call such as `fmt.Print()`, the type checker infers the type `(n int, err error)`.  But for a call with an invalid argument, such as `fmt.Print(undefined)`, the type checker infers an invalid type, even though the result type is known and is independent of the arguments.  This happens for single-result function calls (like `fmt.Sprint`) too.\r\n\r\nI couldn't see an obvious mistake in the go/types/call.go code.\r\n\r\n",
