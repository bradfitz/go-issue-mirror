But IMHO the installer is for users how are happy with single version of Go installed into c:\\go. If you want something different you should build from source.\r\n\r\nInstaller adds your %GOROOT%\\bin directory to the %PATH%. If you use installer to install 2 different versions of Go into 2 different directories, the installer will add both ...\\bin directories to the PATH. How are you going to run the Go version you want?\r\n\r\n\u003e TestDirWindows and TestEnvOverride fails in net/http/cgi test.\r\n\r\nFeel free to create new issue for it. Tests shouldn't fail just because you don't have PERL installed.\r\n\r\n\u003e Now GDB dumps core in TestGdbPython and TestGdbBacktrace.\r\n\r\nSame.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to run all tests to \"build\" your Go installation from source. Just running make.bat should do.\r\n\r\nAlex",
