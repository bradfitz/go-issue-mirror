	"body": "Most companies these days release 'major upgrades' for their product (eg: an new MSI that upgrades a previous MSI installation).  When running the upgrade it will silently remove the previous version of the product behind-the-scenes before installing the new product (or it could install the new product first and remove anything that's orphaned from the previous version at the very end of the upgrade).\r\n\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa369786%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255\u0026MSPPError=-2147217396\r\n\r\nI downloaded 1.6.2 and 1.7 and confirmed the UpgradeCode UUIDs are the same so any upgrade will remove the previous version from the system.\r\n\r\nTo @bradfitz, the ProductCodes have changed between 1.6.2 and 1.7 (also another factor in developing an install as a major upgrade to a previous product release).  The ProductCode changes, the ProductVersion changes, and the UpgradeCode stays the same.\r\n\r\nThere's ways to hack this, but you'll break any future upgrade path possibilites.  Not something I'd advise.",
