I've manually inserted ___chkstk_ms stub into race runtime:\n\nI don't think it is right. But I am no mingw expert.\n\n\u003e ... But mingw inserts calls to it, and then nobody actually links it in. Who should be\nlinking it in?\n\nI don't know much about mingw, but, from what I remember over time, calls to\n___chkstk_ms are inserted by gcc when compiling particular fragments of C code (large\narrays or something). Cgo used to struggle with detection of such tricks, because it was\nworking on source code level (maybe ___chkstk_ms were inserted by the gcc linker). I am\nsomehow under impression that everything works now, so, if you remove your ___chkstk_ms\nimplementation, it will just work. Perhaps minux knows more. Ping him.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
