I find the headings misleading.\r\n\r\nCurrently, (go1.4.2),  $GOPATH imports are alphabetically intermingled with packages from the standard library under a heading \"Standard library\". Further down the page there is a heading \"Other packages\" where I'd naturally expect my imports to be listed. It's not a clear structure.\r\n\r\nI feel that separating Standard Library documentation from GOPATH would make more sense, but even if it's deemed not, the headings need to reflect the structure more accurately.",
