	"body": "No, it does not. I am trying to get the ErrorLog handler to be more generic - basically the error logs that server.go:2259 is throwing are useless as they are in English and have no way to pass along the net.Conn that caused the issue nor an Error code that could be used to generate a localized string in the logs. My suggestion is to actually have an ErrorHandler(net.Conn, error, ...interface{}) that is called if set, and the current processing done only if the ErrorHandler isn't set. Basically, the ErrorLog interface is flawed, and I am suggesting a workaround to not break current compatibility. I want to know about the errors and want to be able to look at the net.Conn's TLS ConnectionState() and find the SNI for example to generate more informational logs and ErrorLog cannot do that.",
