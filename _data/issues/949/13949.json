	"body": "gc is not generating DW_AT_name according to the spec.\r\nDW_AT_name is \"a string representing the name as it appears in the source program.\"\r\nMangled names should go in DW_AT_linkage_name.\r\nI've seen names like these:\r\n  package.functioname for functions\r\n  package.(type).functionname for methods\r\n  package.functioname.func1 for closures\r\n  package.type for types\r\n\r\nThese should all be the linkage_name. \r\n\r\nWe should probably represent packages as DW_TAG_namespace. Functions and types should be children of the package. Methods should be children of the type. Anonymous functions should only have a linkage_name and not a DW_AT_name.\r\n\r\nIt would also be good to fix variables to represent what's in the source, e.g. no '\u0026foo'.",
