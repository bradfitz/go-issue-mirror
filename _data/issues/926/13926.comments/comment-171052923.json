I believe line 5 of the stack trace refers to this function, which is invoked from a C library (the sendmail milter library): https://github.com/Freeaqingme/gomilter/blob/master/gomilter.go#L211\r\n\r\n\u003e  Is it possible that that bug applies to your system?\r\n\r\nI did see the issue, but hadn't related it because the fix was applied well before this kernel was compiled. I'll see if this particular build included the fix for that bug report.\r\n\r\nFtr, I'm not entirely sure where the bug would be. In theory it could be a locking issue in my application code (or so I was told on IRC), but I'm really not able to find it there. It _could_ of course also be an issue with the kernel, but determining where exactly still goes a little over my head.",
