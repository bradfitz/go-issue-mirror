There is a set of values that have been seen, and a set of values that have not been seen.  While executing the body, one of the key/value pairs that has been seen--the most recent pair--was assigned to the variable(s) of the range statement.  There is nothing special about that key/value pair, it's just one of the ones that has already been seen during the iteration.\r\n\r\nI think that once you understand that the meaning of any operation involving the \"current\" entry is clear.",
