I added opinions to goimports, because I made goimports for me, and for use within Google, and inside Google we sort our imports in groups.\r\n\r\nBut FWIW, gofmt won't revert goimport's extra opinionated changes. The output of goimports is still gofmt-compliant.  So it's not like things are flipping back and forth. With enough time and non-zero developers using goimports, all the code should converge on the goimports style.\r\n\r\nI'd really rather not add options to either gofmt or goimports, and I'd rather not remove the goimports behavior.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether we want to make gofmt have the same opinion, though.\r\n\r\nPersonally I puke up a little in my mouth when I see \"github.com\" sorted between \"fmt\" and \"io\". It just looks weird to me.",
