	"body": "The parts of the calling convention I have most recently struggled with doing the RISC-V port are what the exact stack layout looks like. There is reserved space for params and autos, and on some arches Ctxt.FixedFrameSize() reserves space for the return address. Does that space go between the params and autos? Where should the SP point on function entry? I still haven't quite figured out the answer to these questions.\r\n\r\nSome of these questions have more to do with the handling of CALL and TEXT in the assembler, and shouldn't affect programmers writing assembly.",
