I mean we\nhave to support Markdown as well as the current convention simultaneously. it may be\ndifficult that they coexist.\n\nIf we look at other languages, for example, Java, which is considered as one of the most\npopular languages (\u003ca href=\"http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html)\"\u003ehttp://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html)\u003c/a\u003e,\nhas the Japanese API documentation (\u003ca href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/jp/7/api/)\"\u003ehttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/jp/7/api/)\u003c/a\u003e. There will\nbe no reasons that we should neglect localization if we want to make a language more\npopular.\n\nNow I am contributing to an activity to translate the Go official website into Japanese\n(\u003ca href=\"http://godocjp.herokuapp.com/)\"\u003ehttp://godocjp.herokuapp.com/)\u003c/a\u003e to spread the language to more Japanese developers. The\nlanguage support for godoc is mandatory to complete the activity.\u003c/pre\u003e",
