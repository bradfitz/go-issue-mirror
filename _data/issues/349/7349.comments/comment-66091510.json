All we might\nget are more false positives. \n\nDoes anybody have a large and representative corpus of Go packages\nto do some statistics? If dropping the uppercase for the first letter\ndoesn't produce any false positive on 10^6 common Go packages there is\nno real need to enforce it.\n\n(My first proposal for headings was to require _two_ blank lines\nbefore a potential heading. I still do like this as the vertical\nspace in the source looks well to me and shows that something new\nis coming. But this was considered as a step too close in the\ndirection of some formating syntax.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
