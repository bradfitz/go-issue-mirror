	"body": "This was on my radar before I got busy with other things, though I was only looking at `adb -d` and `adb -e` flags for one-off convenience.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, right now `gomobile install` only deals with android, but that may not be the case in the future given the implicit `-target=android`? In that case, polluting the accepted args with adb specific flags seems not great.\r\n\r\n@yyoon your actual use case should be addressable without any change using the env var `ANDROID_SERIAL`. For example, I just tested this and it works ok while also having a hardware device connected:\r\n\r\n```\r\nANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554 gomobile install\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs far as slowing down the build/test cycle, it looks like `gomobile install` always performs a build so you'd actually want to do something like\r\n\r\n```\r\ngomobile build\r\nadb install -s \u003cid0\u003e -r app.apk\r\nadb install -s \u003cid1\u003e -r app.apk\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of calling `gomobile install` multiple times.",
