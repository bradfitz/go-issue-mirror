It is equivalent to removing\nthe file entirely, and you'd see the same results with rm b.go.\nLike many build tools the go command assumes that if the\ninstalled binary is newer than any of the source files, then it\ndoes not need to be rebuilt.  There is no way for it to know\nthat the file is gone, because it has no record of the file.\n\nWe could store information in the installed binary listing the\nfiles that were used to compile it, and then extract that in\nthe build tool to compare against what's now in the directory,\nbut that would be a significant cost - opening all the packages -\nthat is almost always unnecessary.  I am inclined to leave\nthings alone for now.\n\nIf you are doing this frequently, you can use\n    go clean -i\nto delete the installed binary.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
