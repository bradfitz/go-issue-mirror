	"body": "Yes.  We have to be a bit careful, though.  I think there is some confusion (in my head, at least) if Bounded marks a pointer that is non-nil, or a dereference which will not fault.  The former could be on any op that generates a pointer, the latter would only be on OIND or ODOTPTR (any others?).  The tricky part is we need to pick one or the other, a mix won't work.\r\nBounded for bounds checks uses the latter meaning, as there is no way for it to mean the former (it would have to be on a pair of slice+index somehow).  So Bounded for pointer nilness should probably work the same way.\r\nBut that means just marking the return value of newobject isn't the right thing.  You must mark all the OIND that use newobject.  That isn't as easy.\r\nOr we add a new mark to nodes for the non-nil attribute.",
