	"body": "Actually, this isn't fixed.  There's nothing propagating the NonNil flag I added.  So when you do:\r\n```\r\np := new(T)\r\nx := *p\r\n```\r\nIt compiles to OAS(p, OCALL(...)).  The OCALL has the NonNil flag, but it never gets copied to p, so the indirection *p still has a nil check.\r\nIt's tricky to copy it to p during walk, because p may be redefined later.\r\nMaybe SSA could pick up this flag and propagate it.  Have to think about it.\r\n",
