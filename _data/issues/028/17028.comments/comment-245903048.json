	"body": "Has any investigation been done to determine if the binaries built by Kubernetes could be reduced in size?  I suggested this when the problem was first reported.  That would not only resolve your issue with ppc64le and arm but improve compile and link times, save space for your binaries, etc. etc.  I looked briefly at the packages included in hyperkube and it appeared to have many duplicate path names rooted at different locations.  Could there be new versions of some packages being added without removing the old ones that are no longer used?  Or could the binaries get split in any way?\r\nI can send you more detail on the package path names I am referring to if you want @luxas.",
