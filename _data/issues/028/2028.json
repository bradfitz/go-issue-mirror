	"body": "by **danderson@google.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Compile a normal statically linked Go binary on linux.\n2. Copy the binary to a machine (compatible architecture) running a GrSecurity hardened\nkernel.\n3. Try to run the binary. Binary crashes because the kernel enforces write XOR execute\non memory pages.\n4. Try to use the `paxctl` tool to exempt the Go binary from W^X enforcement\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nPaxctl reports successfully tagging the binary with the W^X exemption, binary runs\nhappily.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nPaxctl reports that the binary is not a valid ELF, and errors out.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g, 8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nlinux w/ hardened kernel\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThis is most likely due to a malformation of the section header table, which is the only\nserious error that elflint reports (along with a bunch of section alignment/overlap\nerrors, currently being investigated/fixed at\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/1242)\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/1242)\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nSpecifically, the PHDR section entry appears after the loadable sections, whereas the\nELF spec requires that PHDR appear before loadable sections, along with other structural\nconstraints. Fortunately, it seems that the OS runtime is lenient about those issues, so\nthey're not interfering with execution, but most tools that manipulates ELFs are less\nforgiving.\n\nI'm working on tracking down further issues and sending in patches, but cannot assign\nthe bug to myself, because I'm not a project member.\u003c/pre\u003e",
