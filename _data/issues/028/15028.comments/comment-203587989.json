Are you also planning to send a CL switching the front-end to use IsPtr?\r\n\r\n\u003e Aside: I'm wondering if IsPtrShaped should include the extra checks for single-element structs and arrays that isdirectiface has.\r\n\r\nIt's complicated. See the comment at `case OEFACE` in ssa.go's expr method, around line 1994 right now.\r\n",
