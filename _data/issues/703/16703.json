	"body": "In Go 1.7 the new http.Transport.DialContext field overrides the Dial field.\r\nThis breaks any existing code that takes the http.DefaultTransport,\r\nsets Dial and expects network calls to be made using that value.\r\nThis did actually break some of our test code that used this functionality\r\nto prevent accidental external network access in tests.\r\n\r\nFor better backward compatibility, perhaps it might be better to make Dial\r\noverride DialContext - existing code will continue to work unchanged\r\nand most new code will never touch Dial, so the override isn't so important\r\nin that case.\r\n",
