While that\nseems to be more closely following the wording in the spec, those cases technically do\nnot represent cycles.\n\nMy conclusions:\n\n1) The cases marked as \"odd\" should be considered compiler bugs and no cycles should be\nreported in these cases. This would not invalidate existing programs and thus be a\nbackward-compatible change.\n\n2) The spec should be clarified: If a function/method is not called, there's no\ndependency of that function/method on the \"contents of its body\". This would document\nthe current behavior.\u003c/pre\u003e",
