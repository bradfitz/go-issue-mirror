This would document\nthe current behavior.\n\nWhat about the case where a function/method is not called upon mention, but the value to\nwhich it was assigned is later called?  As in \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/2IvPRGSedt\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/2IvPRGSedt\u003c/a\u003e  Here,\nthere is a dependency on the \"contents of its body\", so there should be an init cycle\nerror reported; but I think you are suggesting that, because the function is not called\nupon mention, there should be no error.\u003c/pre\u003e",
