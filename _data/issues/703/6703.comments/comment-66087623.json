Since a function that is not called may be assigned later\nto some variable (at which point we have lost the actual \"identity\" of the function),\nand that variable may be called, we would loose a dependency.\n\nSo the conclusions in #11 should actually be quite the opposite:\n\n1) The cases marked as \"odd\" at the moment are actually correct. All cases marked as\n\"ok\" at the moment should imply a (potential) cycle and are thus not handled correctly\nin the compilers.\n\n2) The spec's notion of \"mention\" is the right one, but perhaps it should be phrased\nmore clearly.\u003c/pre\u003e",
