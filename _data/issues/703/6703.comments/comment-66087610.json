I believe\n\nT.m is a \"mention\" of method m, and so is\nT.m()\n\nbut:\n\nT{}.m and\nT{}.m() are not.\n\nThe latter (T{}.m) use the type of a value to determine which m is denoted, the former\n(T.m) is explicitly denoting the method m of T.\n\nOr in other words, if the latter constitutes a mention, than the following code would\nconstitute one as well:\n\nvar t T\nt.m\n\nand there are plenty arbitrary complex expressions that evaluate to a value of type T\nfor which this would hold. It gets more interesting if T embeds a type E which has an m.\nFor an x of such a type T, does x.m constitute a \"mention\" of E.m?\n\nConclusions:\n\n- The compiler is clearly inconsistent, but possibly the last example (T{}.m()) should\nnot report an error instead.\n- The spec needs to be clarified.\u003c/pre\u003e",
