I agree that it is too much to require\ndata-flow analysis.  It is much easier to assume that any mention of a function or\nmethod (whether it is in a call expression or not) could (indirectly) lead to a call of\nit.  This will result in false positives (functions which are mentioned but not called\nleading to an init cycle error), which are preferable to false negatives (functions\nwhich are mentioned and indirectly called but no init cycle error is reported).\n\nMy point is that we should not take into account whether a function is immediately\ncalled or not, because even if it is not called immediately (if it is stored in a value)\nit might be called later (via that value).\u003c/pre\u003e",
