	"body": "If I build current git master at or after commit 055ecb7be5805e07498488c59c6f01644fdacccc, it fails:\r\n\r\n    --- FAIL: TestSCMCredentials (0.00s)\r\n            creds_test.go:60: WriteMsgUnix failed with write unix @-\u003e\u003cnil\u003e: sendmsg: operation not permitted, want EPERM\r\n\r\nThis is src/syscall/creds_test.go, which contains code that assumes a net.OpError.Err field is directly a syscall.EPERM:\r\n\r\n    if err.(*net.OpError).Err != syscall.EPERM { .... }\r\n\r\nThis assumption is false after the commit. Now the syscall.EPERM is now wrapped up inside a SyscallError that's the result of calling os.NewSyscallError() in src/net/fd_unix.go's writeMsg().\r\n\r\nThe entire test here is conditional on os.Getuid() not being 0. I assume that the buildbots are running in some environment where os.Getuid() returns 0, which means this entire subtest in TestSCMCredentials() is being skipped. That may be a bug in itself (and there are a number of other tests that are conditional on the UID not being seen as 0).",
