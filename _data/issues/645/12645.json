	"body": "This code works with Go 1.5.1, but on the Playground it fails with \"process took too long\" error:\r\n```go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n\t\"fmt\"\r\n\t\"time\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tc := time.Now().Add(12 * time.Hour * -1)\r\n\tn := time.Now()\r\n\tfmt.Println(c)\r\n\tfmt.Println(n)\r\n\tfmt.Println(n.Sub(c))\r\n}\r\n```\r\nPlayground: https://play.golang.org/p/6_gCBYeLLO.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, it works fine if you remove the trailing newline added by \"Format\". But if you press \"Format\" again and try to run it, it will still time out.\r\n\r\nEDIT: This was first discovered by [bo-banane on Reddit's /r/golang](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/3l5rvq/play_bug_process_took_too_long/).",
