	"body": "Re $PATH:\r\n\r\n(1) I'm pretty frustrated by the tone here, and I worry that if this is what new Go users encounter when they propose things, we may be turning away more people than I realized. I reported a real problem that I encounter regularly, and the response is basically like saying I'm holding my phone wrong. Please try to be more constructive in general.\r\n\r\n(2) Having . in your PATH is not a \"Plan 9 thing\". It is a _Unix_ thing. The original Bourne shell in 7th Edition Unix had a default path of \":/bin:/usr/bin\" (see [usr/src/cmd/sh/msg.c](http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Trees/V7/usr/src/cmd/sh/msg.c)), the leading empty element meaning dot is searched first. Kernighan and Pike's The Unix Programming Environment talks about $PATH a half-dozen times over the course of the book, and every example has dot (implicitly) at the beginning. Searching the current directory in $PATH is a _very_ common setting, even if it has fallen out of favor as the default in Linux distributions. So I'm _not_ holding my phone wrong, thank you very much.\r\n\r\n(3) I am aware of the oft-repeated security arguments. They don't prove I'm holding my phone wrong either.\r\n\r\nEnough about $PATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
