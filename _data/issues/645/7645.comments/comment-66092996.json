It writes\nas much as it can until the socket buffer is full, then it returns the number of bytes\nwritten. EMSGSIZE is only returned for SOCK_DGRAM sockets.\n\nAttaching a simple example that uses UnixConn.WriteMsgUnix() with a large buffer.\nHere is the output i get from it:\n$ go run sendmsg.go\nResult from WriteMsgUnix, bytes written: 1073741824, error: \u0026lt;nil\u0026gt;\nread 219264 bytes\n\nThis is with a completely empty socket queue. If there is less space in it less would be\nwritten.\n\nIn this particular case you can use Write() instead, but in my case I need WriteMsgUnix\nbecause i need to send some oob data too (file descriptor passing).\u003c/pre\u003e",
