If they plan to use a tool, let the tool do the work after the developer decides what they want to test and what they want to not test. Some will want to run dependency tests especially when if multi-platform. Others may decide they don't want the tests. Then the default behavior falls out.\r\n\r\nDo people really not want to make their tools do this work?",
