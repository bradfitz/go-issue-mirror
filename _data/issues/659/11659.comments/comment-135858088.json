If I test the whole project with `go test ./...`, it tests the whole package Y. I don't need to test all of Y, and worse, it will fail if I did not add its recursive dependencies, which I don't need for package X.\r\n\r\nYou may ask why I add the all of Y if I only need X. The reason is that I use git submodules to add the repo, and `go get` behaves the same way.",
