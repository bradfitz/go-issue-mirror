For example, it's useful (at least to me) to be able to run `go list ./vendor/...` and see everything that's been vendored.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the current behavior is ok. It hasn't really been a problem for me (though I understand why some find it inconvenient). For example, when I run interactive commands to test or vet packages, I type `go test` or `go test ./foo ./bar` or maybe `go test ./foo/...` since I generally want to test only one or two packages at a time. Our automated testing system tests all our packages, using a command like `go test $(go list ./...|grep -v vendor)`. This would be inconvenient to type by hand, but there is more than one way to make it convenient. Complicating the behavior of the go command probably isn't the best way.",
