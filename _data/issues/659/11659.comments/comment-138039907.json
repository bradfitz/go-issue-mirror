	"body": "But I said `go list all` specifically, not just `go list`.\r\n\r\nI have multiple tools that use the output of `go list all` to navigate and open Go packages. For example, if I want to go to `github.com/russross/blackfriday`, I expect there to be just one. With vendoring as is, there may be 10, 20 or 30+ matches for blackfriday in various vendor folders.\r\n\r\nAll tools that prefer to preserve previous behavior of not including vendored package copies (e.g., like they did not include the vendored packages in `Godeps/_workspace` subfolders) need to be updated to perform `go list all` and then try to filter out vendored copies. Even if `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT` is not enabled.",
