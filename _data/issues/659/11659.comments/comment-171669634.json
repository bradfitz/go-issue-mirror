Would that be reasonable? I don't think so, because presumably you've verified that the Go release you're using is good and you know net/http isn't changing out from under you.\r\n\r\nI feel things in `vendor/` can be treated similarly: on add/change, verify it works for you, then be sure the vendored code doesn't change.",
