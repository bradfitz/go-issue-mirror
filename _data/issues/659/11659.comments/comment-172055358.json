I'd love to know, concretely, why some folks are so resistant to this idea. Is it because running more tests is slower? (If so, see @rsc's last comment above.)\r\n\r\n\u003e It's a dirty workaround for something that should work out-of-the-box.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, it does work out of the box. That's because I like to run the tests for my dependencies. Of course, anyone is free to prefer otherwise, but that preference doesn't necessarily imply that the go tool's design is wrong.",
