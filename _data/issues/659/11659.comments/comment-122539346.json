	"body": "A couple reasons I would prefer `go test ./...` not include things in `vendor`:\r\n\r\nWhen I choose to take on a dependency, I've already verified it serves my need. That includes verifying automated tests are run by that dependency's overall project, running them myself, or similar. With things in `vendor` likely changing infrequently relative to my project it doesn't feel right to run the same tests for unchanged things every time. This is the same logic I use for feeling comfortable using, say, `net/http` in my project without running its tests every time.\r\n\r\nSecond, It's possible a dependency's tests will never build, work, or be relevant in my particular environment. This could be due to the way the tests are written, differences in developing vs deploying platform, etc. I develop projects on my OS X laptop that use libcontainer that would probably be good examples for this.",
