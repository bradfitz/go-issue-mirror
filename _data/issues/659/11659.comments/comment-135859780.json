I think it is telling that at least godep has always used an ignored `_workspace` path, even when using `godep save -r` which made saved dependencies valid import paths as the vendoring experiment does.\r\n\r\n@bradfitz that is what I figured. I fear if it takes a major release to change the experiment's behavior enough momentum (whether because it's good or not) will be built with the current behavior that it will be unlikely to ever change.",
