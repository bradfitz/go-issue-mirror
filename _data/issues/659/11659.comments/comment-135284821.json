So while I think I understand what you are saying, I don't follow your logic.\r\n\r\nI don't believe this is true, Go 1.4 will see `.../vendor/...` as a valid path and attempt to build, test and install code it find inside it. If the path were `.../_vendor/...` it would be ignored by Go 1.4.2.  Am I misunderstanding how Go 1.4 works ?\r\n\r\n\u003e It would appear you think that tools shouldn't exclude test files should the author request it. Is that true? Could you explain why?\r\n\r\nI am sorry that I gave that impression. I am saying the opposite.",
