One additional point I'd like to make is how vendor code is handled. Many people like to think of vendor code per repository, tools are easier to build using this assumption. I like to think of vendor code per package. The difference is extremely important. When thought of as per package it becomes natural to exclude main packages unless they are requested. It is also a natural extension to exclude files based on if they are test files or other build tags. But if you think of vendor code versions and copying as per repository choosing the packages you want out of the mix becomes much more problematic.\r\n",
