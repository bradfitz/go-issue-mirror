	"body": "@griesemer suggested this was worth looking into, as does a TODO by @rsc in syntax.go.\r\n\r\n@josharian described some initial attempts at this [last year on golang-dev](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/iOF44IL_i1M/CWI9U8XFKsEJ).  @rsc also pointed out that a nil `[]*Node` takes up 3x as much space as a nil `*NodeList`, so it might be desirable to use `*[]*Node` for variables that are commonly nil.\r\n\r\nI've been playing around with this with some success.  One small gotcha I've noticed is that the \"Phase 2\" and \"Phase 3\" typecheck calls can append new Nodes to xtop, so those phases must not use `range` iterations otherwise they'll stop prematurely without iterating over the newly appended Nodes.\r\n\r\nFiling an issue to track discussion/progress.",
