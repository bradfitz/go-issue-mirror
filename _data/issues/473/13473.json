	"body": "The three variables os.Stdin, os.Stdout, and os.Stderr are all *Files, for historical reasons (they predate the io.Writer interface definition).\r\n\r\nThey should be of type io.Reader and io.Writer, respectively. This would make it easier to do interesting things with special input or output processors. For instance, one could say\r\n\r\nos.Stdout = bufio.NewWriter(os.Stdout)\r\nos.Stderr = bufio.NewWriter(os.Stderr)\r\n\r\nand all output, including from log.Printf and fmt.Printf, would be buffered. Much more imaginative things would also be possible.\r\n\r\nAlso, *File is the root of a large dependency tree that simple programs would be able to avoid.\r\n\r\nCan't change it now, but we could in Go 2.",
