	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe current .a files generated by go pack have an entry named __.SYMDEF.  However, the\nformat of this entry is not the same as the format described in the ELF standard, nor is\nit the format used by the older BSD ranlib program.  The effect is that the GNU ar\nprogram, as found on GNU/Linux and other systems, can not be used to examine the\ncontents of the .a file.\n\nThis could be easily fixed by simply renaming __.SYMDEF to something else, as GNU ar and\nother programs recognize the entry by name.\u003c/pre\u003e",
