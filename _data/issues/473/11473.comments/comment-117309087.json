	"body": "Today (2015-06-30,  day with a leap second), the length of a day is 23 times the length of a standard hour, plus the length of the last UTC hour.  That's how long a day is, in terms of questions that we are already willing to answer, combined using operations that we understand.\r\n\r\nIt's also safe to say that someone is more likely to notice a leap second when they happen to ask for a minute spanning the leap second boundary than when they ask for a day spanning the leap second boundary, yet somehow this ambiguity does not prevent us from supporting minutes as a Duration.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, quite a few places (Google and Amazon among them, as well as quite a few financial exchanges, according to the article cited above) are smearing the leap second anyway, so actually *all* our larger-than-second durations at Google (or at Amazon, etc) are slightly wrong today anyhow.\r\n\r\nDo we have a better reason than this alleged ambiguity for saying \"no\"?  Pushing the eat-your-antiambiguity-spinach all the way out to the command line seems user-unfriendly.\r\n",
