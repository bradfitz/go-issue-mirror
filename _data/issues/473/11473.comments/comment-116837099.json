Yes, we have timezones and Daylight Savings times, and yes we have leep years, and yes we have leap seconds.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I brought this up knowing full well that in \"36h\" from now we would have a leep second \r\nhttp://www.timeanddate.com/time/leap-seconds-future.html\r\n\r\nBut remember I said above \"Any discussion about leap seconds, or leap years is orthogonal because it could happen across any Hour boundary as well.\".\r\n\r\nSeriously can we have a flag to specify days in the future.\r\n(Like please show me graphs from the last 90 days).  We really don't care about hours or seconds at that point, we want to show the last 90 days of graphs.\r\n\r\nHaving to specify \"2160h\" to mean 90d is just stupid.\r\n\r\n",
