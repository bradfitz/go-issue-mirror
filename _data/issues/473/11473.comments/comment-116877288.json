I think that the readability argument is more compelling there.\r\n\r\nHowever, `flag.Duration` support strongly suggests `time.ParseDuration` support, which in turn suggests `\"time.Duration\".String` support, which looks superficially like a slippery slope to `time.Day`. Although there are already strings that `time.ParseDuration` can parse that `\"time.Duration\".String` does not generate, like `\"5us\"` and `\"5m3m\"`.\r\n\r\n@bradfitz do you know whether `flag.Duration` support for days also been previously discussed and dismissed?\r\n",
