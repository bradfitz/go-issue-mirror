The patch is at:\n\n    [1] \u003ca href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/8354072/\"\u003ehttp://paste.ubuntu.com/8354072/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nand this is the section of the bug comment referring to it:\n\n4. Improving the Go standard library\n\nImproving the Go standard library appropriately will take a little while as all the code\npaths leading to resolution will need to be refactored to provide a timeout, and\ndifferent APIs will need to be used in different operating systems, and the current hack\nmay need to moved closer to the ones that do not support a better API for this.\n\nWith that said, here is an incipient patch for Linux [1], tested on Ubuntu 14.04. As you\ncan see it makes use of the new getaddrinfo_a function, and enforces the documented\ncapping of 30 seconds. The test suite passes with it, and my cooked failure examples\npass as well. It obviously has seen little real world testing so far, so if you decide\nto use it I'd recommend playing with these edges a little more before the release. It's\nalso important to observe that getaddrinfo_a is a GNU extension and the patch changes\ncode that is common to a number of operating systems, including Mac OS. If the Go\ncompiler is not linking with glibc, the file cgo_unix.go file will need to be duplicated\nso that the proposed changes only affect Linux, and equivalent changes are done using\nspecific APIs for other relevant operating systems.\u003c/pre\u003e",
