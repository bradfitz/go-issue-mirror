That's why I did not submit the patch upstream, despite knowing how\nto send CLs.\n\nYou're also right in that I misread the timeout option as being a total, rather than per\nserver.\n\nThat said, getaddrinfo_a does seem to avoid the bug, and the right fix (for Linux, at\nleast) could build on it by providing the real timeout for the resolving function:\n\n\"The call blocks until one of the following occurs: (...) The  time  interval  specified\n in  timeout  elapses.\"\n\nI don't understand your question about reporting the \"real bug\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
