If getaddrinfo didn't hang,\neverything would work fine.\n\nIf there were a portable mechanism we could use to add a timeout to getaddrinfo, it\nmight be worth pursuing for better efficiency.  But as far as I can tell we can only add\na timeout on GNU/Linux; I don't see any mechanism available on other systems.  And the\ncore problem here, getaddrinfo hanging, appears to be due to a bug on GNU/Linux.  So I\nthink we need to understand the GNU/Linux bug before we start trying to work around it\nby following a different code path.\u003c/pre\u003e",
