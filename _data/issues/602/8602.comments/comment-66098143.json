The\noriginal bug report is saying that many goroutines are hanging waiting on the answer to\na single getaddrinfo request that itself is hanging.  The single getaddrinfo request\nwill have a single file descriptor, so I don't see any reason to assume that large\nnumbers of file descriptors are open.\u003c/pre\u003e",
