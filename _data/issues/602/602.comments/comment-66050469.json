I set\nthis program up artificially to \ndemonstrate which statements are entered and which aren't. The main point is that if you\nuse either math.Pow() \nor another function containing a call to it, and returning a float64 (in this case the\nnumber 1) directly in the \ncondition of an if statement, it'll behave a *bit* like a NaN, but still it won't *be* a\nNaN.\n\nI'm attaching an even further simplified version of the program, to highlight the\nproblem :-)\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/602/2/foo.go\"\u003efoo.go\u003c/a\u003e (179 bytes)",
