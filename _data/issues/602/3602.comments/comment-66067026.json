Oracle bind variables are\nnames preceeded by a colon. In MySQL, DB2 and Firebird, bind variables are represented\nby question marks. In Sybase and MS SQL Server, bind variables are names preceeded by an\n@ sign. In PostgreSQL, bind variables are numbers preceeded by a $ sign.\n\"\"\"\n\nWhat do other database libraries do?\n\nWe could have a mini SQL lexer and say that any ? not in a quoted string can be replaced\nby the driver (optional hook) with the appropriate driver-specific positional bind\nvariable.\u003c/pre\u003e",
