Comments vary from system to system (--,\n/* */ ...), strings are fairly normal (''), but identifiers (\"\", []) vary as well.\n\nI'm writing several drivers where I have reason to parse the SQL at this level, but it\nis at the driver level and it is to work in multiple commands or command groups, and\nsubstituting names in the SQL to ordinal position (for postgresql, this is for the rdb\nfront-end which allows named parameters). But again, this is very unique to the driver\ncode. If a driver wants to normalize it, then let the driver do it's thing.\n\nAlso, \"re-using\" sql shouldn't be an issue here. Anything above the most trivial\nstatements will not port without changes between systems. And a common sql dialect that\ntranslates into system specific sql is well beyond this package's scope.\u003c/pre\u003e",
