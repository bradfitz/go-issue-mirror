	"body": "@dvyukov I'm sorry, I don't understand your suggestion of looking at the -fsanitize=thread flag.\r\n\r\nRight now the test script verifies that the compiler supports -fsanitize=thread.  The bug is because people are using a version of GCC that supports that option, but the generated cgo code doesn't detect it, and so the code intended to tell TSAN that there is no race does not run.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of SANITIZE_THREAD I don't see a way to fix this.  I think we have to change the test to not run when using GCC.  But if you have a better idea I would like to understand it.",
