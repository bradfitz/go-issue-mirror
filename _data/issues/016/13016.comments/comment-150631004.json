The generated source would be required to build cmd gomobile and would be included in the repository.\r\n\r\nThe platform xml in the sdk appears, at least to me, to provide the most information about how everything connects. As far as I'm aware, the conventions and format used in these xml documents hasn't changed in 4 years (if ever).\r\n\r\nParsing files in the android.jar is another option but I didn't immediately see a method to retrieve additional connectivity for validating a manifest during `gomobile build`.",
