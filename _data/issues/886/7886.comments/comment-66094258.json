[Aren't every\npair of identifiers from distinct packages considered to be different? How would they\nnot be?]\n\n\u003e That is how the language is supposed to behave.\n\nOK. I think it is silly (because of a mocking requirement and what possible benefit is\nit?), but OK: it is supposed to behave like that. I can accept that.\n\nThis issue was accepted as requiring a 'clarification' in the spec for this behaviour,\nbecause the spec doesn't say anything about it.\n\nThe revision that closed this issue makes no reference at all to this behaviour.\n\nI think the spec should say how the language is *supposed to behave*. Don't you?\u003c/pre\u003e",
