IMO the\nspec/compiler should either: disallow lower-case (private) methods in interfaces\n(preventing the exploitation of this accidental behaviour), or else introduce a defined\nsemantics for such methods, which allows implementation of private methods (in the Outer\ninterface package). I do not think the present behaviour is desirable, or very useful.\u003c/pre\u003e",
