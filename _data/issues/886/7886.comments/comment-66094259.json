And that's what it\ncomes down to for matching interfaces with implementations (and other interfaces).\n\nThe spec has been corrected to not use the word \"enumerate\" to explain embedding\nanymore, because that was clearly misleading as you have pointed out. It now uses the\nword \"add\" (of methods) which is exactly what is meant, and how embedding of interfaces\nis implemented: The methods of embedded interfaces are simply added to the embedding\ninterface (unless there's a conflict in which case an error is reported - and that's\ncovered by the requirement that interface methods must be unqiue).\n\nThe spec also mentions now that all _exported_and_imported_ methods of an embedded\ninterface are added, exactly to make this behavior of embedding extra clear.\n\nThe fact that one cannot necessarily implement such an interface is a consequence of the\nuniqueness requirement, and it's an intended and welcome side effect (and Ian has\npointed that out already as well). It permits the definition of interfaces that can only\nimplemented by using objects of the package that defines that interface. \n\nI'm considering this issue closed at this point.\u003c/pre\u003e",
