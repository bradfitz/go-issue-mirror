	"body": "Debugging a test failure. Have to stop for now but it looks like in Go 1.5 a failure during `NewGCM(block).Open(packet, nonce, ciphertext, data)` left nonce, ciphertext unchanged. But now in Go 1.6 it looks like they have been modified when the error is returned. Code that tried Open with successive possibilities for data used to be able to reuse the nonce, ciphertext for each call until one succeeded. Now it cannot.\n\nAt the least this requires a note in the release notes. Perhaps the old behavior can be restored instead. Will look more later.\n\n/cc @agl",
