For github.com/mdempsky/maligned, I wanted to measure the size of structs as they'd be implemented by cmd/compile, and I thought StdSizes was meant to be usable by users for that purpose.\r\n\r\nHowever, if StdSizes is just meant to be *a* valid types.Sizes implementation and intentionally not expected to match gc and/or gccgo's semantics, then I think it's reasonable to close as working as intended.",
