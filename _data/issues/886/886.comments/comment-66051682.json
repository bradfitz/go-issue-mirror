I guess it is assumed that\nall threads are asleep. Probably a wrong assumption.\n\nI've written a function that checks whether a null pointer exists in a cache list for\nparticular mcache and inserted it before MCache_ReleaseAll(). Sometimes it says that\nthere is no null pointer, but MCache_ReleaseAll() dies after that. Can't explain it\nother than parallel write access to the mcache.\n\nOr a horrible buffer overflow somewhere else. Any hints on that will be helpful. I'm\ndone for today. :D\u003c/pre\u003e",
