And therefore later in\n'entersyscall' it uses the same code paths in scheduler. This is why your fix affects\nthe way cgo calls behave. I can't say exactly how patch affect the behaviour, but \napparently it's _you_ who supposed to know that.\n\nIf you know someone who is familiar with scheduler's guts please ask him to review your\npatch. The current way GC interacts with scheduler (using mcpu/mcpumax) is totally\nbroken.\n\nAlso note that probably what I'm talking about causes \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/785\"\u003eissue #785\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e",
