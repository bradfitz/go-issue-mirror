For\nexample my 'gomandel' mandelbrot demo became very unresponsive, which basically means\nthat while it was doing hard CPU work, the main OpenGL thread for some reason wasn't\nactive.\n\nOn the other hand it looks like there are correct number of threads and other apps\nbehave correctly. However it gives me reasons to think that something is not the same as\nit was before. I guess we should wait till the release then and see people complaining\nabout cgo issues (if any). If there will be no complains, then good..\u003c/pre\u003e",
