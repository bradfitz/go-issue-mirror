The point i am making is:\n\n\"there are about 300 packages installed on my linux system and *none* needs \"ed\".\"\n\nsaying nothing more than *ed is commonly available* is not a point at all. there's\nlots available. do you still use xfig? how many tcl/tk progs do you run? distros even\nship dialects of basic. which shell do you expect? did you install moonlight to watch\nthe president? at least it has a wider user base. there are lots of small tools\nnobody really uses seriously. many are deprecated.\n\nsed is not obsolete because it is widely in use! otherwise, it were. however, i wrote\nthat ed is *redundant*. this is the point. it is as same redundant as hundreds of\nfurther packages on your favourite distro: because really nobody except\ntraditionalists like you seem to be using that stuff.\n\nfor example, simpleinit is deprecated and will be dropped from util-linux because\n\"nobody uses it!\" that is the reason, and not that there is ng-init or whatever more\ncomplicated available. this is why people stick with gdm or kdm and mainly ignore\nxdm. ed is just a redundant draw-in from your side. as said, i installed it only to\nbe able to install go. and this after more than 10 years of an ed-less time. think\nabout it!\n\nstop! there was another moment i installed it for short because, wtf, the first adobe\nreader for linux used it to let the user agree to the license !?\u003c/pre\u003e",
