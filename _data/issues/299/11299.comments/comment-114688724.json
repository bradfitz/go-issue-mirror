	"body": "So an OpenAL context doesn't have any explicit state or methods by itself: there's no ctx.SetFoo, or ctx.GenSource methods, or some sort of bind(ctx, src) function? Instead, 'the current context' is some sort of global state, and app code is meant to explicitly remember which of multiple contexts is 'the current context' whenever dealing with sources? Do contexts just affect sources, or do they affect buffers too? Are sources (and buffers) bound to exactly 1 context (as opposed to 1:N, M:1 or M:N)?",
