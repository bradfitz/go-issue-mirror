The OpenAL programming guide explains the relationships between Context and other objects on page 7 at http://grva.lamce.coppe.ufrj.br/labcogsdk/download/extras/openal/OpenAL_Programmers_Guide.pdf.\r\n\r\nThe audio sources are bound to the context they have created on. Buffers are shared among all contexts, so they are visible process-wide.\r\n\r\nI have also read even though OpenAL spec documents the object relationships the way above, the implementations of OpenAL are mostly broken. On Windows, I have read online reports that only a single Context can be created. Another disclaimer is that I had no time to investigate the limitations of OpenAL Soft on multiple platforms.",
