You need 2.6.27, and\n2.6.29 is strongly recommended. Before then, the atomic operations were broken in the\nkernel (armv5 needs kernel assistance for atomics)\n\nThat said, there is probably a bug with the syscall definition for sendto(2) and friends\non linux/arm.\n\nCan you please create a short code sample, just setup the socket, do a sendto or\nrecvfrom and print out the error.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-none**, **repo-main**, **arch-arm**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
