This is especially significant because the openpgp standard (RFC 4880) requires\nall symmetric ciphers to be used in CFB mode. So, among other things, this makes the use\nof go.crypto/openpgp essentially impossible for large bulk encryptions when using AES\n128 or 256 as the symmetric cipher.\u003c/pre\u003e",
