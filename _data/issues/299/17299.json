	"body": "### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.7.1 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\n`go get` a package that belonged to a repository that used a custom [git remote helper](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote-helpers).\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nThe repo was successfully fetched.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\"cannot download, \\\u003crepo\\\u003e uses insecure protocol\"\r\n\r\n### Proposal \r\nvcs.go is opinionated about what schemes are [considered secure](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/go/vcs.go#L44). If you are using a [git remote helper](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote-helpers), tools like `go get` will return an error because it thinks it is insecure. Passing `--insecure` allows the repo to be successfully fetched, but this isn't ideal because then all fetches that are pulled in from `go get` will allow insecure schemes.\r\n\r\nWe should let vcs.go be aware of the [GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL](https://git-scm.com/docs/git) environment variable to override the list of secure schemes for git fetches.\r\n\r\nOther tools like [git-codereview](https://github.com/golang/review) that are affected by [similar issues](https://github.com/golang/review/blob/master/git-codereview/api.go#L76) should also be updated.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to work on this.",
