The relevant lines from the spec are:\r\n\r\n\"If the function's signature declares result parameters, the function body's statement list must end in a terminating statement.\" (https://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Function_declarations)\r\n\r\n\"A statement list ends in a terminating statement if the list is not empty and its final **non-empty** statement is terminating.\" (https://golang.org/ref/spec#Terminating_statements, end of paragraph).\r\n\r\nThus:\r\n1) The function must end in a terminating statement since it declares a result; and\r\n2) The final **non-empty** statement is the for loop which neither has a loop condition nor a break statement and thus is terminating.\r\n\r\n@mdempsky was correct, too, because in 2015 this was still a gc bug :-) The relevant sentence in the spec changed in 2016 (https://github.com/golang/go/commit/b5ddbb9).\r\n",
