For example, in typeutil, we could add utility functions that, given a *types.Package, return a struct describing the tests within it, or a generated source file containing a main function like what `go test` would generate.  go/loader could be extended to create and type-check these packages automatically, and then the SSA package wouldn't need to know about them.\r\n",
