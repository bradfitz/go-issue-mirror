RFC 3986 is clear that dots are allowed in scheme \nnames, so server.com:443, parsed as a URL, really is scheme server.com path 443, \njust as mailto:443 would be scheme mailto, path 443.\n\nRFC 2817, which talks about CONNECT, says that the Request-URI is an \"authority\", \nwhich is to say it's a bare host:port and not a URI.\n\nI think the fix is that http handlers that implement the CONNECT method should \nconsult req.URL.Raw instead of looking at the parsed fields.\n\nPlease take a look at the two RFCs and see what you think.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
