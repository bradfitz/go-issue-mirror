Actually, I could reproduce error identical to your error. This implies the issue is a bug of Go.\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/NKrG7ctjq8\r\n\r\nThe above depicts the bug, not why happens, for these who don't live in China, such as me living in Korea.\r\n\r\nI think that the bug stems from `lib/time/timezone.zip` which Go uses to determine the information of local timezone of your computer. It may be a workaround that you do not use the information given by `lib/time/timezone.zip`, then use `time.Local = time.FixedZone(\"CST\", 3600*8)` instead.\r\n",
