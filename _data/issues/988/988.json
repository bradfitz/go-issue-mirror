	"body": "by **jdnurmi**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003ecrypto/x509 does not actually use any algorithms but SHA1WithRSA, and any attempt to\ncreate or validate one will fail.\n\nI've attached a patch that expands its capabilities to include RSA+MD5,SHA256,384 \u0026amp;\n512.\n\nIt is a breaking patch, in that anyone using CreateCertificate without having specified\nSignatureAlgorithm will get an error.\n\nIt's a rough patch that just implements that bare functionality (and test fixes).  I am\ncompletely open to fixing this for style or functionality as needed, or you can just run\nwith it;  I have verified go can verify its own generated certs, and that openSSL can\nparse them -- though I've not done extensive validation tests.\n\nI'm also by no means a crypto expert, but the places I needed to patch seemed pretty\nstraight forward.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/988/0/x509-patch.1\"\u003ex509-patch.1\u003c/a\u003e (4480 bytes)",
