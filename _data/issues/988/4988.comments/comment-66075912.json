That kind of misses the point. Of course it is easy to\nimplement functions like popcount and find-first-set with bit fiddling, but such an\nimplementation is around ten to twenty times slower than an implementation that uses a\ncompiler intrinsic that directly emits a single instruction when possible. This matters\nin some use cases. It would be nice to have bit-fiddling functions that can be\nimplemented easily with special instructions in a core package.\u003c/pre\u003e",
