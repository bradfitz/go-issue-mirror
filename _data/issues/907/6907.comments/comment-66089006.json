I've worked with enough language bindings\nto know not to screw around with the runtime like that.\n\nRather, if I'm going to have to make a copy of the string to call my API, it seems\nwasteful to create an intermediate copy with C.GoString rather than just using the\noriginal Go string as source for the copy.\n\nSimilarly, for API calls that can deal with constant string data plus a length, it'd be\nnice to be able to do so without a copy.\n\nIf there are existing ways to handle this kind of thing, would it be possible to\ndocument them?\u003c/pre\u003e",
