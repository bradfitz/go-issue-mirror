But ...\n\nI use linux to develop for windows. I build windows executables on linux\n(\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/WindowsCrossCompiling)\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/WindowsCrossCompiling)\u003c/a\u003e. Then I run them on\nwindows, collect whatemver profile I need then use \"go tool pprof ...\" on linux again to\nanalyse it.\n\nAlternatively, you could run \"go tool pprof ...\" on windows, but, obviously, you will\nneed perl, /usr/bin/file and maybe some other unix tools. My mingw has all these, so it\njust works.\n\nAlso, as shivakumar.gn said, you can get perl from \u003ca href=\"http://www.ActiveState.com\"\u003ehttp://www.ActiveState.com\u003c/a\u003e and use\nthat too (make sure perl's bin directory is in your PATH). Mind you, it does not come\nwith /usr/bin/file which determines what utils use to examine your executable. But\nshivakumar.gn posted fix for that \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/12311044\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/12311044\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nHope it helps.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
