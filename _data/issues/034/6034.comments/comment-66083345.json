Could it be the OS?\nMy OS is Win7 professional.\n\nThere are 2 problems as I see in current tool. If below 2 problems are fixed the problem\nvanishes.\n\n    # problem #1 in setting the pdb path -\u003e \n    #    \"/usr/bin/file\" is not present change to \"file\" if GnuWin32 is present\n    #    \"/dev/null\" must instead by NUL\n    my $file_type = `/usr/bin/file -L $prog_file 2\u003e/dev/null || /usr/bin/file $prog_file`;\n    if ($file_type =~ /MS Windows/) {\n        ...set pdb file \n    }\n\nIf \"/usr/bin/file\" is changed to \"file\" will work for anyone who has \"file\" in the path\n(Ex: GnuWin32 in my case).\nBut to make it work for everyone, better to check for the OS instead =\u003e assuming people\nare not doing debugging of ELF binaries on windows.\n\n    # problem #2 - executing \"go tool nm\" - redirection should be to NUL and not /dev/null\n    go tool nm $image 2\u003e/dev/null | sort\n\nIf \"/dev/null\" is changed to \"NUL\" this problem is addressed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
