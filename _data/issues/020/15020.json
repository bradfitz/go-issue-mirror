The standard library packages are in the first group.\"`.\r\n\r\nHowever godoc simply sorts imports in lexicographical order.\r\nThis makes it very hard to find the documentation of a standard package.\r\n\r\nThe order should be:\r\n1) standard library packages\r\n2) golang.org/x/ packages\r\n3) other packages",
