What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to reproduce is to run x/exp/shiny/example/basic on Mac, and use a physical mouse wheel to see the mouse direction of the event that gets printed to the terminal, then compare it to the direction that the scroll wheel scrolls the window in a non-shiny app (ie. on Chrome, in a terminal window, etc)\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n* Scrolling down with a mouse wheel sends a ButtonWheelDown (-2) event when OS X's ridiculous \"Scroll direction: natural\" option is turned off in mouse system preferences and a ButtonWheelUp (-1) event when it's turned on. \r\n* Scrolling up with a mouse wheel sends a ButtonWheelUp (-1) event when \"Scroll direction: natural\" is turned off and ButtonWheelDown (-2) when it's turned on.\r\n\r\nThis would make the OS X behaviour consistent with how the X11 et al drivers work.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nMouse wheel events send the opposite direction of what's expected.\r\n",
