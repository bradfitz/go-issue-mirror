	"body": "First of all while the shadow check is not accurate I still find it helpful especially when used interactively with an editor. From my experience accidental shadowing usually leads to unpredictable bugs that are hard to track (possibly because I am coming from Java where shadowed variables are not allowed) and any help from the tools is appreciated. \r\n\r\nSecondly the main motivation for this proposal is not to enable shadow check by default but to make it easier to turn it on by plugins. \r\n\r\nThe only way to run all vet checks (including shadow) at the moment is to invoke go vet twice. It is possible to do it from the flycheck but the plugin author is reluctant to accept such change because it adds more complexity and such approach is different from the rest of the checkers. It would be good if it was possible to have a new flycheck configuration option \"enable-shadow\" that just translates to a go vet command line flag.\r\n\r\nThe concern about any upcoming experimental features is reasonable though. I'd like to propose an alternative approach to `-extra` flag: if `-all` flag is specified then any additional checks enabled via command line flags should run together with the checks enabled by `-all` flag. E.g.\r\n\r\n- `go tool vet -all` will run all standard checks (as it does now)\r\n- `go tool vet -all -shadow` will run all standard checks *and* shadow check (currently this command runs *only* shadow check)\r\n- `go tool vet -shadow` will run *only* shadow check (as it does now)\r\n",
