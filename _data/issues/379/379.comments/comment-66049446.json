That says nothing about when\na, b, and c are evaluated, just the order in which they are \ncombined.\n\nThe order of evaluation section in the spec says that function\ncalls happen left to right, no matter what.  f(5) gets called\nfirst, then f(6), then f(3), then f(2), then f(1).\n\nWhich is what is happening.  It's correct.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
