I have changed it to\nstart with 2G and grow up to 4G max. I had to restart the system to do that. Lets see\nwhat difference it makes. I am bit concerned that we need to fiddle with the system to\nrun our builder. I hope it is new tests, not our build tools or new standard lib changes\nthat are the reason. Perhaps, I worry too much.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
