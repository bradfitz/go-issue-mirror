	"body": "The way I tested the compiler for a while was to run randomly generated code on go1.5 go1.6 and dev.ssa and compare the results. I found quite a few bugs in all three versions, and lots of missed optimizations in the new compiler. The sources of the tester are here https://github.com/brtzsnr/gostress. It's limited however to arithmetic operations and branches. No loops, no bounds checking, no calls, no slices, no strings, etc.\r\n\r\nFor speed I mostly looked at the binary size of pkg/tools/linux_amd64/* which is an indirect measure. Compilebench is also another metric. I also tested changes on my personal projects and saw a speedup of ~2% in the last week. Tracking the performance on a set of benchmarks would be a start (e.g. all benchmarks in stdlib).\r\n\r\nPerformance regressions are indeed the most problematic. For example I recently retested https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/19727/ and concluded it's now a regression. I don't know when that happened and I don't know how to test this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
