Sometimes run go install -race std before doing a race build of your command\n3. Some days after that, run gofmt over all your source code\n4. Be confused about why gofmt takes minutes instead of seconds\n\nTurns out go install -race std installed a race-enabled gofmt. Maybe a tweak somewhere\nwill save a few people the confusion I've been experiencing.\u003c/pre\u003e",
