If so, you can get a stack trace by running \none of the broken program by hand.  For example:\n\ncd $GOROOT/test/chan\n6g nonblock.go\n6l nonblock.6\n./6.out\n./6.out\n./6.out\n...\n\nIt feels like you are up against some kind of memory\ncorruption, but it is very weird that no one else is seeing this.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._",
