But making sigpanic non-preemptable all the way down is hard. \nIt calls panicstring, which calls panic, \n\nCalls to runtime.panicnil definitely look simpler and more reliable. But we need to\nunderstand how many of these are there. Calls will increase binary size as well, right?\n\nOtherwise can't we do something like -- in the beginning of sigpanic (or somewhere\nnearby) rewind PC to the beginning of function (we won't resume it's execution anyway?\nFor panic/recover we need only function return values to be alive (and anything that is\npotentially captured by defer closure).\u003c/pre\u003e",
