	"body": "The difference is that in the void* case, cgo doesn't figre out that the value does not point to a value that contains a Go pointer, and therefore inserts a check call.  In the char* case, cgo can see that the type C.char can not contain a pointer, and therefore there is no need to use a check call.  The check call causes the pointer to appear to escape, forcing buf to be allocated on the heap.",
