	"body": "by **ninkendo**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThis is on a University server (I'm the admin) and I'm trying to get Go \nworking on an NFS mount so all our Ubuntu servers can have the go compiler \non it (so students can play around with it.)\n\nI can consistently compile Go from a directory like /tmp or /usr/src, but \ncloning the hg tree to a NFS-mounted direcory always results in a segfault.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Clone the mercurial tree to an NFS filesystem\n2. Set GOBIN to any directory, on or off NFS\n3. cd to $GOROOT/src and run ./all.bash\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\nExpected build to perform the same as it does on non-nfs filesystems.\n\nInstead, get the following:\n\ngopack grc _obj/runtime.a _go_.6 asm.6 cgocall.6 chan.6 closure.6 float.6 \nhashmap.6 iface.6 malloc.6 mcache.6 mcentral.6 mem.6 mfixalloc.6 mgc0.6 \nmheap.6 mheapmap64.6 msize.6 print.6 proc.6 reflect.6 rune.6 runtime.6 \nrt0.6 sema.6 signal.6 slice.6 string.6 symtab.6 sys.6 thread.6 traceback.6\nmake[1]: *** [_obj/runtime.a] Segmentation fault\nrm reflect.c string.c sema.c malloc.c\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/nfs/apps/go/src/pkg/runtime'\nmake: *** [runtime.install] Error 2\n\nI can reliably reproduce the segfault from $GOROOT/src/pkg/runtime and \nrunning the above gopack command.\n\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux, amd64\n\n(Ubuntu 8.04.3 LTS, kernel 2.6.24-24-server)\n\nWhich revision are you sync'ed to?  (hg log -l 1)\n\nchangeset:   3975:b51fd2d6c160\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nstrace dump is included.  It looks like it's segfaulting trying to talk to \nwinbind for user authentication?  Not sure if gopack is doing any of this, \nor if it's library code... but it reliably works when $GOROOT is on a local \nfilesystem.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/48/0/strace.txt\"\u003estrace.txt\u003c/a\u003e (9011 bytes)",
