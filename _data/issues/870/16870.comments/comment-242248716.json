	"body": "The issues all appear to be in walk.go's handling of various OAS2xxx nodes.  In particular, they all assume ok to be of boolean type.\r\n\r\nOAS2RECV generates a call to runtime.chanrecv2 and pretends its return type is ok's, which is problematic if ok is interface{}.\r\n\r\nOAS2MAPR does something similar, rewriting mapaccess2*'s second result parameter type to match ok's.\r\n\r\nOAS2DOTTYPE for conversions to a concrete type generates an expression to assign to ok.  The assignment succeeds by creating an implicit conversion.  But the ok variable is used in an OIF node as the condition later, which fails.",
