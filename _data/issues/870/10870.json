	"body": "I've noticed a couple comments in Go assembly routines \"TODO replace this with a jump table in the future\" and when I tried implementing an assembly routine with a jump table I realized why it hasn't been tried yet. The assembler does not support using labels in data, so there's no easy way to construct the jump table. My incomplete understanding of x64 architecture is that jumps are signed 32 bit offsets from the instruction pointer, which seems like it would make it difficult to implement. Maybe there's also a way to do a jump to a 64bit virtual address, I don't know.\r\n\r\nAnyway if it's not too difficult, this would be a nice to have.",
