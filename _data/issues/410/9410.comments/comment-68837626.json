You can then restrict to only use one of the two Go files for a build depending on the presence of the new build tag.\r\nOlder Go 1.4 and older go tool versions won't have the new build tag and hence they will independently of the SWIG version use the old code path. Go 1.5 and newer go tool versions will require SWIG 3.0.4+ and with the new build tag will always use the new code path.",
