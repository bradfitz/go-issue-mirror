	"body": "While it's easy to get the input file name (through Getattr(n, \"infile\")),\r\nhowever, getting absolute path requires platform dependent code,\r\nand it depends on the file location, so it's not as stable as hash of\r\nthe swig input file.\r\nHow about using a hash of the swig input files just like we did for cgo?\r\n\r\nIs there any predefined hash algorithms in SWIG? MD5 is probably\r\ntoo big to import.\r\n\r\nMy current code uses SipHash-2-4, with hardcoded key. It adds\r\nabout 50 lines. But it requires uint64_t and stdint.h. Is that OK?\r\n\r\nThe changes are ready. Fully tested on Go 1.1.2, 1.2.1, 1.3.3, 1.4\r\nand tip.\r\nPlease review (https://golang.org/cl/2540 and https://github.com/minux/swig/tree/go1.5).\r\nThanks.",
