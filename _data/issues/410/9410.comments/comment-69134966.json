It's fully backward compatible\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n(Ian, do you mind me making the misc/swig/* tests a little more\r\ncomprehensive by adding some code that causes swig to issue\r\ncgo calls inside init()?)\r\n\r\nswig: https://github.com/minux/swig/tree/go1.5 (beware force updates)\r\ncmd/go: https://gist.github.com/minux/13f18a1735f51edeaf7e\r\n\r\nOne question: I'm naming the global swig_init_go_PACKAGENAME,\r\nbut what if the user uses two packages with the same package\r\nname but different import paths? I guess cmd/go should always\r\nprovide -fgo-pkgpath so that we can use pkgpath here?\r\n\r\nPlease provide review comments, thanks!",
