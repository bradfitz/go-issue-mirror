	"body": "I know of three possible approaches to fix SWIG (there is no tracking bug).\r\n\r\nThe first approach is to change SWIG to generate cgo input rather than doing the same thing as cgo.  This is the best approach because it should fix most SWIG issues for all time.  It is probably also more complicated.\r\n\r\nThe second approach is for the go tool to convert the _gc.c file generated by SWIG into Go.  This is a mechanical translation, and will not require a new SWIG release.  It's very ugly.\r\n\r\nThe third approach is to change SWIG to add the _gc.c information to the .go file.  This is not very satisfactory as the result will not work with versions of Go before 1.4.",
