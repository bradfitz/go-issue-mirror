Is the ELF format all they'll have in common, or will they contain the same information and layout, such that the tools you're producing would be able to work on core files from any of those three sources?\r\n\r\n\u003e Ideally, there will be a 'one-click' solution to get from running program to dump. One possible way to do this would be to add a library to expose a special HTTP handler. Requesting the page would that would trigger a core dump to a user-specified location on disk while the program's running, and start the heap dump viewer program.\r\n\r\nWhat information is currently missing from Linux core dumps of Go programs that would be necessary to reconstruct the heap? What is required to include that information in GOTRACEBACK=crash core dumps?\r\n",
