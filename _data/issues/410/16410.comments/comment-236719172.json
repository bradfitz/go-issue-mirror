	"body": "@tombergan I haven't had a chance to look very deeply at the API in your package yet, but it looks good.\r\n\r\nMy plan was to start by working on in support libraries for reading and understanding cores files as heap dumps into golang.org/x/tools/cmd/heapview/internal as support code. Once we're more confident about it, we can move the libraries into golang.org/x/tools/heap, but working in an internal package at first allows us some flexibility in changing the API.\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to start with your API interface (and as much of the code that's applicable to cores as heaps) golang.org/x/tools/cmd/heapview/internal and build from there. What do you think?",
