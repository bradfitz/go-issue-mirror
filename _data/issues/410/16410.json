	"body": "@alandonovan @randall77 @aclements \r\n\r\nI'd like to propose a new tool: a viewer for go heap dumps. \r\n\r\n`runtime/debug.WriteHeapDump` already provides a mechanism for writing heap dumps, but we don't provide a tool to inspect the heap dumps. We should provide a graphical tool for inspecting and analyzing heap dumps similar to those that exist for Java heap dumps.\r\n\r\nThe tool would fit best in the tools subrepo or the core repo.",
