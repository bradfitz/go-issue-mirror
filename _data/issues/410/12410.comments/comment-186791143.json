It is limited to only truetype fonts.\r\n\r\ngithub.com/golang/freetype/truetype is still current, but it now implements an interface defined by golang.org/x/image/font. The latter is independent of any particular font format. Think of it like package image in the standard library, and the former package, g.c/g/f/t, as like package image/jpeg or golang.org/x/image/webp, except that it happens to be in a separate repo, mainly because it has a separate license.",
