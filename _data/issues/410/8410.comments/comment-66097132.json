As a consequence When a map is very sparse (1 item per bucket),\nrandomization is ineffective.\n\nAnother issue is that a \"pop\" pattern: deleting an element of the map after first\niteration, will leave the map in a very unbalanced state. Popping all elements will take\na quadratic time instead of something like O(n log n) or maybe a bit more as it is in Go\n1.2.\u003c/pre\u003e",
