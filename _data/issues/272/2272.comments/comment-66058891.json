It'd be really gross to add\na second.\n\nArguably the biggest feature of DumpRequest is its Request.Body saving/cloning. \nOtherwise you could just use Request.Write.  So I assume that this function was intended\nto show the *outgoing* wire representation.\n\nShould we rename it to DumpClientRequest and add a DumpServerRequest?\n\nShould we keep the \"body bool\" parameter or make the client do that?  Perhaps exposing\ndrainBody as an *http.DumpBodySaver type?  Seems like too much package noise and too\nmuch abstraction for a debug function.\n\nI'm happy to do whatever if people have opinions.\u003c/pre\u003e",
