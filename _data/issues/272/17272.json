	"body": "Given that null references cause so much unexpected trouble, what about reporting untested entry points that could cause nil point panics on the code coverage report?\r\n\r\nThis could be limited to public functions and show as a small flag on the HTML reports.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n...\r\nvar projects, err = repo.GetProjects() [nil]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `[nil]` would actually be a report flag saying this code wasn't covered with a nil return for this value.\r\n\r\nReference: [Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake\r\n](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare)",
