	"body": "I'm looking at a machine with Sierra installed now.  The problem seems to be that `runtime.nanotime` is not consistent.  The failure I'm seeing is that `notetsleep_internal` sets `deadline` based on `nanotime` and sleeps.  It wakes up after a timeout.  It recomputes the deadline by calling `nanotime` again.  The second call to `nanotime` returns a completely different, unrelated, value, causing `notetsleep_internal` to go to sleep for a very long time.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the first call to `nanotime` returns a number like `1467928044254360339` and the second call returns `0`.",
