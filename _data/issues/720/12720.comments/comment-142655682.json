	"body": "@RomanSaveljev \"(arr, i \u0026 maxKeys)\" is not a single expression. But the point is that \"i \u0026 maxKeys\" if standing \"alone\", including standing alone inside ()'s, gets the space around the '\u0026', and otherwise it won't. Which is why we get\r\n```\r\n\tf(arr, i\u0026maxKeys)\r\n\tg(i \u0026 maxKeys)\r\n\th = (i \u0026 maxKeys)\r\n\ti = x + i\u0026maxKeys\r\n```\r\nto show some examples. That is, an expression inside a parameter list (== a list of expressions) is treated similarly to an expression inside larger expression (e.g., \"a list of terms in a sum\" as in a + b + c where each a, b, c is \"inside\").\r\n",
