Do we have to highlight in this example `sort.SearchInts(arr, i \u0026 maxKeys)` that `\u0026` is evaluated before `,`?\r\n\r\nI read the long comment for `binaryExpr`:\r\n\r\n\u003e To choose the cutoff, look at the whole expression\r\n\r\nIs `(arr, i \u0026 maxKeys)` a single expression? I might be lacking the deep insights into Go now, but from other languages I practice I remember that it is not. A generic compiler may decide to evaluate function parameters in any order and there is no precedence between them \"per se\", which might have to be highlighted. (I might have used wrong wording here and I hope my point is understandable)\r\n\r\nI am sorry, but in my opinion this error report is different from other closed reports. I could not find the answer from `binaryExpr` comment either.",
