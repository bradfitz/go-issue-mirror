In one project at CloudFlare I have implemented some code\nto recycle []byte buffers which are used to hold web pages. These were being allocated\nand released to the GC for cleanup. We now have a small package that accepts them back\non a channel and maintains a list in a goroutine of available buffers. Anyone needing a\nbuffer just receives on a channel and gets the next item from the list or a new buffer\nif none are available.\n\nThe code also keeps track of the size of the list discarding buffers if it looks like\nthere are 'too many'. The idea being that we don't keep buffers that were allocated\nduring a burst of activity.\u003c/pre\u003e",
