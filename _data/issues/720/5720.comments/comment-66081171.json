Your report of a clean compile on Raspbmc convinced\nme that there's something different about my setup causing the compile error.\n\nI tracked it down: I was building go/ on a a cifs-mounted drive living on another\nmachine. That drive has an NTFS filesystem, ie. fuseblk on cifs.\n\nWhen I untarred the go/ 1.1.1 src directly onto the Raspberry Pi's SD card filesystem,\nit compiled without problems first time. I assume that there's some file permissions\nproblem on the cifs drive which is causing a certain part of the go compile to\nmisbehave. Maybe you can shed some light on that?\n\nThanks for your help in narrowing this down. Had me foxed for a while.\n\nAndrew.\u003c/pre\u003e",
