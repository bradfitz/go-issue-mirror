So I\nbelieve that HLE is entirely implementable in the common case, which is the only case in\nwhich it can be plausibly be used anyhow.\n\nIt should also be straightforward for the compiler to annotate lock/unlock in the same\ngoroutine for the benefit of dynamic analysis, if that seems useful.\n\nNot that I'm necessarily opposed to this idea, but I think you need stronger arguments.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **release-none**._",
