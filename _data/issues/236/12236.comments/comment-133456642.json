	"body": "Thanks.  I can recreate the problem.  It's a bug in how the go tool generates the library name.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is: don't cd DIR and run \"go install -buildmode=shared -linkshared\".  Instead, run \"go install -buildmode=shared -linkshared DIR\".  The go tool is using the explicit argument to construct the library name.  When you don't give it any argument, the go tool generates \"lib.so\".  That then confuses the linker.\r\n\r\nCC @mwhudson ",
