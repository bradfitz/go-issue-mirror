If this \"excessive\" evaluation of\nparameters is really an issue, then I understand the exclusion from the Go libraries\n(although I would be interested in hearing the motivation behind this claim, especially\nwith regards to the motivation for making the default logging for the C++ library always\nevaluate its parameters).\n\nIs it just the issue of evaluating arguments? There appears to be the additional claim\nthat Go, lacking macros and a preprocessor, cannot support a clean logging package.\u003c/pre\u003e",
