No macros, for one thing.  More generally, there is no way\nto provide logging levels efficiently, since the arguments would always be evaluated\neven if the logging call is not going to produce any output.\n\nBecause these features cannot be provided well, they will not be provided at all. There\nare external implementations of logging that are prepared to make the compromise\ndifferently; perhaps they can help you.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
