	"body": "The text/template function `index` should permit integer values of float type as indexes, since there's no way to convert types in templates themselves.\r\n\r\nI hit this particular problem when using unmarshaled JSON as the template data, similar to what's done in the play link below, where an integer in one part refers to an index of a list in another part, but when parsed, the integer is converted to float64.\r\n\r\nNote that the function `eq` is also loose with types.\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/_9K1wu6THk\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n    9\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n    template: :1:2: executing \"\" at \u003cindex .a .b\u003e: error calling index: cannot index slice/array with type float64",
