You may be able to figure\nthat out by running strace or truss to see what the system call is.\n\nThe second is that gdb gets confused by the debug info for go_bootstrap.  That has\nnothing to do with the bad system call.  That may be because you are using an old\nversion of gdb.  The Go linker will generate that for objects with no type, and most\nversions of gdb do not complain.  What version of gdb are you using?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **openbsd**._",
