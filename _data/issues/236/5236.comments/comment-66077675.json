Dan, please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\u0026gt;\n\u0026gt; Postgres consists of several processes that handle ENOMEM and\n\u0026gt; continue to operate normally (instead of, say, crashing), and they can\n\u0026gt; make good use of as much physical memory as is available. At the\n\u0026gt; same time, we run a few Go processes that require very little actual\n\u0026gt; memory but take a lot of virtual memory. Since overcommit is off, the\n\u0026gt; unused virtual memory of the Go processes consumes and wastes\n\u0026gt; physical memory. We'd prefer to make that physical memory available\n\u0026gt; to postgres.\u003c/pre\u003e",
