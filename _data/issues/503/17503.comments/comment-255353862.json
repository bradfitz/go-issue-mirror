	"body": "We used the \"double barrier\" to address stack scanning issues in the IBM J9 implementation of Metronome.  It's in section 4.3 of \"Design and implementation of a comprehensive real-time java virtual machine\" by Auerbach et al, section 4.3.  In that case we were incrementalizing over many thread's stacks, as opposed to the individual stack, but it solves the same problem.\r\n\r\nIt worked well, although the extra barrier overhead was annoying.  Let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\ndavid (dfb@google.com)",
