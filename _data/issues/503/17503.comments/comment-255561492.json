I haven't checked, but I suspect we've gained more than that from other optimizations since Go 1.7.\r\n\r\nThey are harder to eliminate at compile time. I completely disabled the optimizations that don't carry over directly to the hybrid barrier and binaries got about 1% larger. We could eliminate some of these, but it requires flow analysis and the current insertion code doesn't do any flow analysis. OTOH, the places where we can eliminate write barriers with the current write barrier aren't all that common anyway (how often do you write the address of a global to something?), so we're not losing much.",
