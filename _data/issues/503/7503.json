	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThere are a few easy performance wins available for `go run run.go`. I pulled them\ntogether in \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/72590045\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/72590045\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nOn my laptop, it decreases wall time to run tests from 35.8s to 22.5s (-37%). On a\nRaspberry Pi, wall time drops from 22m55s to 18m55s (-17%, but also -4m!). Further\noptimizations along the same lines offer only minimal further improvements.\n\nFiling this issue so that it doesn't get forgotten in the next three months. Even if for\nsome reason we wanted this for Go 1.3, we should wait until \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/7344\"\u003eissue #7344\u003c/a\u003e is resolved, as\nthis CL masks that issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
