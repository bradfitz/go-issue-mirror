I am still puzzled about your\nreasoning. Thank you.\n\nI can see dave's point about it having 'temporary' flag, but I am not sure, if that can\nbe provided on windows. Even on non-windows, it could be a fickle - misconfigured DNS\ncould be a 'temporary' thing until responsible person fixes it. :-)\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
