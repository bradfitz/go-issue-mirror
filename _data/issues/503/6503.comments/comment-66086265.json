I'd like to know how to deal with the error.\n\nThe error returned on windows is whatever Windows API DnsQuery returns. Go stdlib just\npassing the message.\n\n\u003e ... Am I supposed to use a regular expression to figure out what sort of error\noccurred? ...\n\nCan you explain what do you mean by \"sort of error\". I am not sure that all possible\nerrors here can be enumerated and categorized here. And why would you? How will it help\nyou in your user program?\n\n\u003e ... Also, there is no good reason for this to be inconsistent.  If the issue is that\nit just hasn't been made consistent, that's fine, but that doesn't mean that it should\nstay that way.  If there is a different reason, it'd be nice to see that reason\nexplained.\n\nIf you are talking about net.DNSError on Unix and os.SyscallError on Windows, then, I\nthink, no one though about it until now. Ii just happend to be that way. And I don't see\nwhy it is important for these to be the same.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
