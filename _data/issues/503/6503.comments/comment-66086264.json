Am I supposed to use a regular expression\nto figure out what sort of error occurred?  Also, there is no good reason for this to be\ninconsistent.  If the issue is that it just hasn't been made consistent, that's fine,\nbut that doesn't mean that it should stay that way.  If there is a different reason,\nit'd be nice to see that reason explained.\u003c/pre\u003e",
