Once you have 9 methods, surely somebody would want to add a tenth later, but they can't for compatibility reasons. 9 methods is also hard to implement. We'd probably have to add some sort of EmptyResolver type that people could embed which just returned errors for everything.\r\n\r\nI'd start with looking at which interfaces are actually needed by the things this bug is about. Maybe you'd have 9 interfaces instead (maybe starting with 3?) and combine them as needed like io.ReadWriteCloser? I don't know. I haven't given this much thought yet.\r\n",
