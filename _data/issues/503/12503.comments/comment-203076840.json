It turned out Android uses custom dns resolver interface. https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/master/libc/dns/net/gethnamaddr.c#564 An application opens `/dev/socket/dnsproxyd` socket and uses it to resolve names. I tried `GODEBUG=netdns=cgo` and for some reason it does not work on Android.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if I can implement a custom dns resolver and tell my application to use it.  Here is similar issue from another project [1].\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-android/issues/412#issuecomment-115376055",
