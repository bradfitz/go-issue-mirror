	"body": "The -trimpath flag for the assembler tools no longer seems to work.  It looks like it's probably broken for cmd/5g, etc. too.\r\n\r\ncmd/old5a, cmd/5g, etc. use the -trimpath flag to directly set ctxt.Trimpath.  cmd/asm uses it to set a TrimPath var, which is then copied into ctxt.Trimpath.  In any case, the Trimpath field is never read from.\r\n\r\ncmd/internal/obj's LineHist struct type has a TrimPathPrefix field, but it's never assigned to.",
