You can't .(T) a slice\ntype right now, so it would not be overloading anything, and like an\ninterface type assertion it can fail or be checked at run time.\nYou can even think of it as []int containing a *[10]int the same way\nan interface value holds a concrete type, and you're extracting the\nunderlying array pointer.\n\nThat said, I don't think this is important enough to worry about now.\nThere is enough else going on.\u003c/pre\u003e",
