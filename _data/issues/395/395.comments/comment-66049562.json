The Go\nAPI uses slices heavily even though the same length is expected. Being able to get the\nunderlying array would allow usage as map keys.\n\nTwo examples I've run into recently are hashes (SHA-256) and IP addresses (as 16 byte\nslices). It seems rather wasteful to have to copy them or transform them to strings to\nhave to use them as map keys.\u003c/pre\u003e",
