I've simplified the syntax to\r\n\r\n``ArrayAssertion  = \".\" \"[\" Expression \"]\"``\r\n\r\nIf needed, `s[min:max].[max-min]`, where min and max are constants, will produce pointer with offset. (I guess this may be recognised by the compiler and optimised, but I don't have enough knowledge of the Go internals to implement such optimisations yet.)\r\n\r\nI'm ready to either mail my prototype (with the \"DO NOT SUBMIT\" tag?) or go through the proposal process once the proposal repo is up and the tree opens.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure how to mail it. The parts I have now can be divided into three separate CLs: the spec change, teaching go/ast and go/parser about array assertions, and the implementation in cmd/compile/internal/gc and runtime.",
