More information:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/go-gl/gl/pull/111\"\u003ehttps://github.com/go-gl/gl/pull/111\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe underlying OpenGL API only accepts the equivalent of, e.g, a *[4]float32, so it is\nnice to have this in the type system on our side. OTOH, a consumer of this API might be\nholding a []float32 they want to pass to us. So it would be great to find a solution to\nthis, as the current solutions are a bit messy or require the use of unsafe.\u003c/pre\u003e",
