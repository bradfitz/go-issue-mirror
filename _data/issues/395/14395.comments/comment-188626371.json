That seems like a good place to encode advice.\r\n\r\nI'm also strongly in favor of updating the docs with better guidance. In particular, I think the examples should reflect correct use of the strong/modern primitives.\r\n\r\nI've had to correct damage done by copy+pasting the [unauthenticated CBC example](https://godoc.org/crypto/cipher#example-NewCBCEncrypter) several times in the past year because that comment about `crypto/hmac` just doesn't convey the problem to a generalist developer. Even the new [GCM example](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/980364b7a2425657a5c66dcad4e52f6cd3723a77) confusingly makes ASCII strings of various lengths seem like viable AES keys.\r\n\r\nSure, a legacy system might still be using DES-HMAC-MD4 for something. That's a fine reason to have the implementations. It's not a good argument for presenting that as an equally acceptable choice to developers who aren't crypto specialists.",
