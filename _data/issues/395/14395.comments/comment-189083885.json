Much better to use higher-level\nfunctionality from x/crypto/nacl in that case.\n\nIt's quite easy to design a system with crypto/aes that has fatal\nflaws (for example, bad padding algorithm and bad mac/encrypt\nordering), and make the attacker's life much easier than bruteforcing\n56-bit key of DES or constructing collisions for MD5.\n\nGood primitive will not make bad programs secure. Unless the\ngo compiler gains the ability to statically prove that a program is\nsecure, it shouldn't tell the user it's using insecure primitives.\n",
