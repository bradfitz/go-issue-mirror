I would not want the mere fact of importing crypto/md5 to trigger commentary from Go, nor would I want us to remove them from the library.\r\n\r\nBut it's perfectly fine for us to update our own higher-level code not to invoke them without confirmation. For example crypto/x509 today returns an InsecureAlgorithmError for MD2+RSA and MD5+RSA, and I have been expecting that in some future release it will do that for SHA1+X too by default, with a clearly-named insecure way to override the default.",
