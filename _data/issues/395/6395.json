What do you see instead?\n\nExpected: if the compiler is going to offer a hint, it should say Shutdown is a\nfunction, not a method, and I don't know where it got the d. bit from, d.shutdown does\nnot match the expected interface method d.Shutdown.\n\nGot: prog.go:16: d.Shutdown is a field, not a method\n\nPlease use labels and text to provide additional information.\u003c/pre\u003e",
