However, we measured several times, and Unmount alone _clearly_ isn't responsible for the difference.\r\n\r\nI can remember we instrumented at multiple places in that code path, and no particular segment of that code path could explain the timings difference between single core and multi core machines. This is why we ended up thinking it might be a runtime issue.",
