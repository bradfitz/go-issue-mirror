We want to be able to handle the case where the client sends\nan invalid Content-Length header and return a 400 status.  We were intercepting the\nerror raised here:\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/net/http/transfer.go?name=release-branch.go1.2#212\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/net/http/transfer.go?name=release-branch.go1.2#212\u003c/a\u003e,\nand using that to do this.  Since \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/10237050/\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/10237050/\u003c/a\u003e it seems that\nthis error is no longer being raised.\n\nThe sample code we've included in this bugreport is a reduction of our reverse proxy to\nthe minimal code that exposes the problem.\n\n\nThe thing we need to be able to do is to detect an error caused by an invalid\ncontent-length header in the request, and respond accordingly.  If there's a better way\nof achieving this that would be great.\n\n\n[1] \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/alphagov/router/\"\u003ehttps://github.com/alphagov/router/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
