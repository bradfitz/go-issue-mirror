The Transport, if it sees a response before\nit's done writing, will return the response it got. This typically occurs when a client\nis sending a large file (without Expect 100-continue) and the server is replying\nUnauthorized and hanging up, rather than reading 1GB from a client just to discard it. \nIn this case we want the client to see the Unauthorized HTTP error, and not a generic\ntransport failure.\n\nProof that the Transport is still checking it: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/YdbTG7kWJF\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/YdbTG7kWJF\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIf you really want to check this, you'll need to count \u0026 buffer in your reverse proxy,\nbut be careful that you have limits, so people can't swamp your memory.\n\nAlternatively, actually read the whole body in your server handlers and return a 400\nthere if the client was wrong.\u003c/pre\u003e",
