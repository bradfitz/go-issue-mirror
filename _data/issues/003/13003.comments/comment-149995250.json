Streaming support is a good concrete example from Nigel, but we don't have a comprehensive analysis of what features we want and don't want yet. To do so involves doing some research and design work.\r\n\r\nPart of that work would be answering questions like: of the top (say) 100 apps on each platform, how many can be built today with x/exp/audio? Can the ones that we cannot build be broken down into various categories? What features does each category need? Which of those features can be implemented in a portable way? How do other APIs implement these features?\r\n\r\n(In retrospect this design work should have been done up front before any programming, but I did not yet have a good sense for how to think about portable mobile APIs.)\r\n\r\nUntil that's done, I can't judge whether a proposal about implementation details is a step forward or not.",
