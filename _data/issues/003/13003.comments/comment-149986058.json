	"body": "\u003e This is describing an implementation, but the first step is a design.\r\n\r\nCould you extend what could be the expectation from an audio player that runs on mobile devices? I have no desire to design a generic audio framework that addresses each expectation for every possible common use case.\r\n\r\nWithout any actionable feedback, our conversations about the audio player is being constantly black-holed and I cannot progress on this issue.\r\n\r\nI have a limited scope which is providing a player (plays, stops, pauses, etc) an audio source and does it effectively. If you desire to ship a framework that enables audio programmers, that's not in the scope of audio.Player and can be addressed later.\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal against audio.Player, not a proposal to replace the audio package. Please give feedback in the scope of my current improvement plan.",
