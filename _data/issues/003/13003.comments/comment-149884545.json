	"body": "I agree with Nigel and Andrew. This is describing an implementation, but the first step is a design. That includes: a high-level description of what will be possible with the API, a survey of existing audio APIs on other platforms, a list of real-world programs that could be implemented with the features described in the API, and some example programs showing how programs can do those things with the new API.\r\n\r\nWithout specific use-cases selected and prototyped, an API will end up either too general (a common complaint among people I have asked for their opinion on audio APIs) or too limited (like the current audio package).",
