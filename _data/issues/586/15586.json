This issue is to consider whether it's worth adding a vet check along the same lines.\r\n\r\nThe check would be to look for expressions of the form (x BOP x), where:\r\n\r\n* x is not of type float\r\n* BOP is one of: \u0026 \u0026\u0026 | || == != - / % ^ \u0026^\r\n* x is a side-effect free expression (see the boolean conditions check)\r\n\r\nThese expressions are either redundant or have a constant value (with some very rare exceptions, like division and the smallest negative integer), which indicates that they are probably a mistake, and in any case would be better written in another way.\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @robpike for opinions\r\n\r\ncc @valyala in case you are interested in playing with more vet checks :)\r\n",
