	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n1. install go\n\ncd $GOROOT/src\n./all.bash\n\n2. cross compile mingw runtime\n\nexport GOOS=mingw\ncd $GOROOT/src/pkg/runtime\nmake clean\nmake install\n\n3. cross compile my simple program\n\ncd ~/test\ncat test.go\n\npackage main\n\nfunc main() {\n\tprint(\u0026quot;hello world\\n\u0026quot;)\n}\n\nexport GOOS=mingw\n~/bin/8g -o _go_.8 test.go\n~/bin/8l -o test.exe _go_.8\n\n4. copy resulting binary test.exe to Win2000 pc and run it, it output\nnothing and exits.\n\nWhat is the expected output? \n\nhello world\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n\u0026lt;nothing\u0026gt;\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n\nGOARCH=386\nGOOS=linux\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\n36e71486f51f+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI figured the problem is that the executable built by 8l, doesn't have\n\u0026quot;import table\u0026quot; and Win2000 loader is not smart enough to implicitly link\nkernel32.dll functions, used by runtime. The reference that helped me here\nis: \u003ca href=\"http://www.phreedom.org/solar/code/tinype/\"\u003ehttp://www.phreedom.org/solar/code/tinype/\u003c/a\u003e. That's the only ref I could\nfind.\n\nI have made the change to the PE building code, and it seems to be doing\nthe trick. Happy to provide the code.\n\n\nThank you.\u003c/pre\u003e",
