This is presumably a method stub generated by the compiler that translates\ntcpconn.Close() into tcpconn.conn.Close().  The compiler should generate better line\nnumber information for this stub; I'm not sure what it should generate, but dial.go:1 is\nactively misleading.  If we can't think of anything else, it would be better to say\n\u0026lt;unknown\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;generated\u0026gt; than to say dial.go:1.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._",
