On further inquiry I've been told that that feature has been turned off. I don't\nsee a strong argument for making such imports work starting in Go 1.2 when you cannot\ncreate new ones. (It does appear that old ones are still available, but given that they\nwon't work with Go pre-1.2 the benefit seems marginal at best.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
