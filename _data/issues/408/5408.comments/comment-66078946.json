I just created a clone of a\ncode.google.com repo - specifically go9p. It wound up being\ncode.google.com/r/\u0026lt;mumble\u0026gt;-go9p. Attempting to go get the cloned repo yields the\ndreaded invalid code.google.com/ import path error. The obvious workaround is to create\na local copy, strip the VCS info out of it, and load it into github or bitbucket. This\nmakes contributing fixes/enhancements upstream tedious and error\nprone. Please reconsider making the go tool chain recognize code.google.com/r paths.\u003c/pre\u003e",
