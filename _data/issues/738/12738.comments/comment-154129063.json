After that, can you please run:\n\n\t$ WORK=\u003cline from output\u003e\n\t$ gdb --args /usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/6l -o $WORK/command-line-arguments/_obj/exe/a.out -L $WORK -extld=gcc $WORK/command-line-arguments.a\n\t(gdb) r\n\t... program crashes in malloc, hopefully ...\n\t(gdb) where\n\nIt may be interesting to see what the stack trace is at the failure. Another possibility would be to run `valgrind` instead of `gdb --args` and see if valgrind detects any misuse of memory from within 6l.\n\nThanks.",
