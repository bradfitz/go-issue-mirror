	"body": "Hmm. My approach seems to work well in the cases where all of the exports data is available, but falls down in cases where something includes packages that indirectly include an internal package like \"golang_org/x/net/http2/hpack\" -- hpack has a long list of other imported packages, and it's difficult to stitch/interleave those init calls into the dependence graph without being able to read its export data.\r\n\r\nAlternate proposal: change the libgo makefile to export *.gox files for hidden/internal packages (so that we can have a single mechanism for computing init priority), but mark them in some way so that the compiler can refuse to allow things in them to be imported. For example, the \".go_export\" section could be renamed \".go_export_h\", or something other such scheme. ",
