	"body": "@alexbrainman Thanks for picking up the trail on this one (and the random number one too). The goal of this change is to stop loading shell32.dll into all Go processes; this is where the expense comes from. There are at least a couple possibilities why you're not seeing the improvement that I saw:\r\n* I tested on Windows 10. It's possible (but unlikely) that in Windows 7 something else triggered a shell32 load, and so this change is insufficient to remove loading of shell32 on Windows 7.\r\n* Perhaps Go took a dependency on shell32 somewhere else since I originally opened this issue.\r\n\r\nOne idea to figure this out is to use a debugger to determine whether shell32 is getting loaded during process run before and after the change.",
