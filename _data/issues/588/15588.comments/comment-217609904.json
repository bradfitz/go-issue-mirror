We used to have a test for syscall.EscapeArg, but it's got lost over time. We would run Go process as a child of another Go process and make sure the arguments parent pass to the child match arguments received by the child. We would have a table of unusual arguments to test. We should resurrect that test. It will test your new code too. I suppose we could create new test regardless of your work. I will try and create this test if I have time.\r\n\r\nAlex",
