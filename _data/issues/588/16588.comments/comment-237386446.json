The current documentation which is misleading you is just not complete enough probably. It was only added recently.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do something fancy like this, just `import \"golang.org/x/net/http2\"` and call `http2.ConfigureServer` yourself, which will do the right thing and append itself to any existing protocol you have registered.\r\n",
