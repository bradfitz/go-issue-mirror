	"body": "On Android Kitkat and higher, the [Storage Access Framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider.html) is the only way to read/write files on an external SD card (eg `/storage/sdcard1/`).\r\n\r\nHowever, access to that is handled through URIs like this:\r\n```\r\ncontent://com.android.providers.media.documents/document/image:62\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese URIs can't easily be converted to paths [1]. We need this for syncthing-android, and have discussed this already [2] [3].\r\n\r\nGo Version: 1.4.2\r\nOS: Android, any architecture\r\n\r\n[1] http://stackoverflow.com/q/20067508/1837158\r\n[2] https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-android/issues/29\r\n[3] https://forum.syncthing.net/t/writing-to-external-sd-card-in-android-5-0-and-above/2492",
