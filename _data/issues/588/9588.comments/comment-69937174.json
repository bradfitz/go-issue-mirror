If you have to deal with it, deal it with before passing your reader to encoding/csv.  If you have a file that is not UTF-8, you will to use a translating reader anyhow, as encoding/csv, like all Go code, expects UTF-8.\r\n\r\nWhile it's true that U+FEFF is a space, the UTF-8 representation of U+FEFF is not the literal bytes FEFF.",
