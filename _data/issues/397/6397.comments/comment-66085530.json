Maybe C is going to record\nthe pointer in some data structure and use it on the next call? In general this\nabsolutely cannot work. Passing Go pointers to C is not allowed. Full stop. It's not\nmuch different than writing Go pointers to disk and reading them back and expecting them\nto still point to the same data.\n\nThe garbage collector only knows the Go heap.\u003c/pre\u003e",
