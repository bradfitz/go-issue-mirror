And I don't have write access to http://golang.org/s/windowsbuilderhowto\r\n\r\nBut, I think, winstrap is not very usable for anyone, but its authors. They use it to convert new Windows PC into fully functional builder with minimum time and effort. And for documenting the process. I don't see why anyone else would want to do that.\r\n\r\n\u003e It looks like wstrap.exe is a 64-bit binary, so it needs to be Windows 64-bit.\r\n\r\nYou're correct. But Brad and Andrew use Windows 64-bit PCs only, so it works for them.\r\n\r\n\u003e But windows 7? or 8?\r\n\r\nIt should work for any supported (by Go) Windows version. Starting from Windows XP and up.\r\n\r\nClosing as nothing to do.\r\n\r\nAlex",
