	"body": "After installing 1.6beta2, `go install myapp` results in `go install vendor/golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack: open C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Go\\pkg\\windows_amd64\\vendor\\golang.org\\x\\net\\http2\\hpack.a: Access is denied.`\r\n\r\nhpack.a exists at that path and is readable from my account, so I guess the error comes from an attempt to re-compile hpack.a in a non-writable path.\r\n\r\nIt appears as though the special case code that avoids trying to write to system paths is broken with a /vendor/ in the system path, and/or the new installer isn't setting magic timestamps on hpack.a the way it is did on the go1.5 .a files.\r\n\r\nAfter becoming superuser and touching hpack.a, `go install` completes normally.\r\n\r\nhpack.a had a timestamp shortly after its source files, so I'm not sure why `go install` is trying to rebuild it. A fudge factor to account for the poor resolution of FAT timestamps (despite the fact I'm on NTFS), maybe?",
