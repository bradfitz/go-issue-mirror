	"body": "Let's say I have a `http.HandlerFunc` or a `http.Hander` I want to benchmark.\r\nIn a real world situation, this function would received an instance of `*http.response` which implements `WriteString()`. A call to `io.WriteString(w, str)` will execute `w.WriteString(str)` instead of `w.Write([]byte(str))` which save us a unnecessary allocation.\r\n\r\nThis situation is not consistent with `httptest.ResponseRecorder` because it does not implement `WriteString()`.\r\n\r\n\r\nI propose to implement `WriteString(str)` in  `httptest.ResponseRecorder` in order to achieve more accurate benchmarks.\r\nhttps://github.com/gin-gonic/go/commit/347b0c5aa60c47ac7a7fc0c0b267c8113ce2e66e\r\n\r\nOff topic: maybe we should implement `WriteString()` in another instances of http.ResponseWriter such as: cgi.response and fcgi.response, but this is probably a different issue.\r\n",
