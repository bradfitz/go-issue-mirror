	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe instruction 48 8b 0c 25 c0 5c 07 80 is disassembled as MOVQ 0x80075cc0, CX. It\nshould be disassembled as MOVQ 0xffffffff80075cc0, CX. Addresses are signed, and should\nbe sign-extended. See the discussion in \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/7980\"\u003eissue #7980\u003c/a\u003e for details.\n\nTo reproduce, run 'go tool objdump addr31 0x2000 0x2012'. addr31 is attached. It was\ncreated by stripping a binary built from the code in \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/7980\"\u003eissue #7980\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/8000/0/addr31.gz\"\u003eaddr31.gz\u003c/a\u003e (153196 bytes)",
