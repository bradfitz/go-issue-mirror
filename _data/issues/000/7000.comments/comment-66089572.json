The masking is very dumb as I recall\n- just a repeated, 32-bit XOR mask. But it does need to be random.\n\nThere are also other cases where we need very rapid entropy: AES-CBC in TLS for one,\nwhere each record needs a random IV.\n\nIdeally, this would be a thread-local structure (or CPU-local, where the kernel supports\nit).\u003c/pre\u003e",
