The man page for urandom on OS X says:\n\n     /dev/urandom is a compatibility nod to Linux. On Linux, /dev/urandom will\n     produce lower quality output if the entropy pool drains, while\n     /dev/random will prefer to block and wait for additional entropy to be\n     collected.  With Yarrow, this choice and distinction is not necessary,\n     and the two devices behave identically. You may use either.\n\nSo it would seem that Yarrow isn't as fast as whatever PRNG Linux's urandom switches\nover to when it runs out of entropy. Makes sense.\n\nI suggest changing the websocket code to seed itself once from the cryptographic RNG\nwhen it opens the socket and use that seed to run a PRNG. (Which is in fact what the\nregular srandomdev() and random() syscalls do on OS X.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
