We've had a couple of issues reported to us at [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/3558), at least the first of which looks related, unsure on the second.\r\n\r\nIt's something we didn't have any reports of before the most recent stable release \u0026 the most recent couple release candidates for 1.7. Our data seems to back that up; there's a jump of ~40 daily Go build failures on 10.12 to 190 yesterday.\r\n\r\nIs there any chance at all of a 1.4.4 release being pushed up? Completely understand if the answer is no. ",
