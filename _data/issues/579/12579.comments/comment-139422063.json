	"body": "With `bindv6only=1`, `Listen(\"tcp\", \"[::]:port\")` is IPv6-only, and `Listen(\"tcp\", \"0.0.0.0:port\")` / `Listen(\"tcp\", \":port\")` are IPv4-only.  I would argue that `\"tcp\"` with any wildcard should always listen on both IPv4+IPv6 using either one dual-stack socket, or two single-stack sockets (unless the kernel is IPv4/IPv6-only, of course).  The issues I filed back in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9334 still stand.\r\n\r\nThe `\"tcp4\"` and `\"tcp6\"` modes allow you to force single-stack sockets.  For anything more advanced, the socket API is not a great place to put firewall rules.",
