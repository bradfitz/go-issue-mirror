	"body": "Debugging into this a bit - it seems that at least some of the offending \"branch too far\" errors are coming from calls to omovlit, when the assembler is trying to insert a load literal; hence the output of MOVD etc.\r\n\r\nThe brdist is failing because the offset between the MOVD and the literal is out of the range of a 19 bit immediate. I have yet to discover why this happens - I'm not completely familiar with this code or when/how the literal pools get flushed and adjusted as we insert ops.",
