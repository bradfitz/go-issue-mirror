Those which are complicated, \"var v1 b\" and etc, should throw syntax errors\nfor a while.\n\nWith new runtime changes, those syntax errors could begin to compile as it becomes\nsimple or possible to implement them.\n\nFor a first step, maybe only implement the reflect functionality? For example, replace\nreflect.TypeOf, with just .(type), that should be simple?\n\nI'm not an expert, but I think it could improve.\u003c/pre\u003e",
