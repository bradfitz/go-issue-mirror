However, I don't understand how returning an opaque value from a `.Context()` method would allow assignment into the `*Request`. If you did `newctx = context.WithValue(req.Context(), myContextualData, value)`, how do you put `newctx` back into the `*http.Request` such that `myContextualData` is associated with the request from here on out?",
