This works because it's a concrete type, and so doesn't fall under the Go1 compat promise, for adding stuff. AFAIK nobody needs to recreate / edit those for any reason already.\r\n\r\nThere's a couple of problems I can think of: \r\n1) kinda breaks the idiom if \"context is first argument\".\r\n2) IIRC http.Request already has a Done channel on it. so `context.Context` would need it's Done element renamed. This is possible as the .../context package doesn't fall under the compat promise (yet?)",
