	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCould we add a shutdown/cleanup mechanism to the testing package?\n\nBackground: some tests (notably: integration-style tests) require heavy setup, compiling\nthings, setting up things on disk, running child processes wired together, etc.\n\nIf you just do this once and share it per test, it's unclear when to clean up the /tmp\nfolder and shut down the processes.\n\nPeople have resorted to things like TestZZZ for cleanup (which doesn't work well with\n-test.run), or z_last_test.go (as seen in net/http), or the hoops jumped through here:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bradfitz/docker/blob/fuse/vfuse/all_test.go\"\u003ehttps://github.com/bradfitz/docker/blob/fuse/vfuse/all_test.go\u003c/a\u003e\n\n(Look at release and testsToRun and how it's calculated.)\n\nAnd also hacks in Google's code, even people so far as to fork the testing package.\n\nOr people run a child process that is responsible for cleanup, once it notices its\nparent has died. But that's a lot of work and there are portability concerns.\n\nI know a test could still crash mid-way through, so cleanup on shutdown is still best\neffort, but when it's a bunch of big processes and big files in /tmp, that's better than\nnothing most the time.\n\nWith regard to atexit-ish concerns, I'd propose the shutdown mechanism itself be subject\nto the same timeout concerns.  If the shutdown doesn't finish in N seconds, the test\nexits with failure.\u003c/pre\u003e",
