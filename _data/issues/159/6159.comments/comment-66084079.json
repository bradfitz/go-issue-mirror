You don't really need to run tests, if you just want to install Go. Of\ncourse, as you discovered, skipping tests means that some functions might not work as\nadvertised.\n\nYou can also skip tests selectively by renaming the function - all tests must start with\nTest. So, if you rename TestIPv4MulticastListener to testIPv4MulticastListener or\nsimilar, all.bat will not run this test.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
