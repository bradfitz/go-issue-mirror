So I'm not really sure what can be done with this in Go (maybe close the issue? if nothing else) Or maybe somehow make sure the error includes this fact: that either that error happened(and thus you have multicast support enabled in OS) OR that you may have manually disabled multicast support in OS.(wonder if there's some way to detect if multicast support is enabled or disabled, and have it reported as an error instead)\u003c/pre\u003e",
