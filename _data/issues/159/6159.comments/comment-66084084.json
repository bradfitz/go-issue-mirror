I only have the firewall part of comodo (with defense+ disabled - this\ncould've qualified(maybe?) as a debugger of some kind if it weren't permanently disabled\nwhich required a restart when I did it, long ago)\n\nI've also encountered the hang just now with `go test net -short` (can't kill\nnet.test.exe again)\n\ntrying with PeerBlock disabled and firewall enabled, it doesn't seem to hang so far WHEN\ninternet cable is unplugged. But when plugged in, I notice that firewall blocks DNS\naccess for svchost.exe (4 times, total 8 seconds duration) and `go test net -short`\nhangs(well it did one time), but after this \nrunning `go test net -short` doesn't hang anymore. It's almost as if it only happens\nright after plugging in the internet cable and when firewall is denying DNS to\nsvchost... so if I plug the internet cable and wait like 10 seconds (until firewall is\ndone denying svchost DNS 4 times) then run `go test net -short` it will work and any\nsuccessive runs still work. But if I plug the cable and then run `got test net -short`\n... well it still works so far :)) I guess maybe that was a coincidence that it hung\nwhen it did\n\nI really can't reproduce this hang... I just got another hang after unplugging and then\nrunning `go test net`, so I really don't know\u003c/pre\u003e",
