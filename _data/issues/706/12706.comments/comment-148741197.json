This isn't about personal preference on password prompts; it's about ensuring correct operation in that case, so it is certainly the go command's purview.\n\nI'm not particularly inclined to add yet another environment variable.\n\nPerhaps we could change the go command to leave any existing $GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT in place, so that people who really want the broken behavior can set GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=1.",
