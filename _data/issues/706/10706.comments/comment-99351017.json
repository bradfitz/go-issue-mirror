Does killing gomote process clears remote side of its TCP connection? Maybe it takes a while. You also don't check cmd.Process.Kill() returned error, perhaps, if you add more error checking / printing, we'll know more.\r\n\r\nBut if you help me with error above maybe I can reproduce it here. Thank you.\r\n\r\nAlex",
