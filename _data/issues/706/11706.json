	"body": "While trying to detect goroutines leaks from my program I noticed that runtime.NumGoroutine reports much higher number of goroutines (5) than reported by runtime.Stack (1).\r\nAfter some poking around I figured that there are, indeed, some system routines running in the background.\r\n\r\nHere is the repro: http://play.golang.org/p/WowC44lsh9\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\n1) This is only reproducible in go 1.5. Go 1.4 works correctly\r\n2) The behavior of runtime.Stack() depends on the GOTRACEBACK environment variable. If it is set to \"2\" then runtime.Stack() outputs all 5 goroutines.\r\nSo this looks like runtime.NumGoroutine() should also depend on this environment variable to stay consistent (outputting only user-created goroutines is a feature and is very welcome).\r\n",
