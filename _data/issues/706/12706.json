	"body": "The go get command was changed in 1.5 to disable git prompts universally (see issue #9341). This change reduced choice for how people want to work with the go get command (and was slightly aggrivating to track down). I'd suggest reverting the change and letting people set their own (git-standard) environment variable to disable the prompts themselves. It shouldn't be go's purview to allow or disallow prompts.\r\n\r\nEven if the previous change isn't reversed, it should be easy to check for a GO_GET_GIT_COMMAND_PROMPT env var or something along those lines to make it easier to configure. Currently, I have to make sure git knows my username and password for every place I want to download from, where it would be easier to just set an env var and say I want those interactive prompts back.",
