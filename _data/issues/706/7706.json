	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eSometimes it's required to temporary disable tests, reduce number of iterations or scale\ntimeouts under race detector.\n\nWe use this extensively for C++ race detector and memory checker in large projects that\ndevelop quickly (e.g. Chromium).\n\nCurrently it's quite difficult to do, you need to add 2 new files (+build race/!race).\nWhen the test is fixed, you need to delete the files consequently.\n\nSee e.g.:\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/44180043/diff/60001/src/pkg/runtime/pprof/pprof_test.go\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/44180043/diff/60001/src/pkg/runtime/pprof/pprof_test.go\u003c/a\u003e\nwhere we have to completely disable the test, while we want to do it only under race\ndetector.\n\nThe proposal is to add something like\npackage race\nconst IsEnabled = true/false\u003c/pre\u003e",
