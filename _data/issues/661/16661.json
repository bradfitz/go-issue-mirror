	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo1.4\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports\r\npackage golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports\r\n\timports runtime/trace: unrecognized import path \"runtime/trace\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ $GOPATH/bin/goimports\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n```console\r\n   imports runtime/trace: unrecognized import path \"runtime/trace\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeen here: https://travis-ci.org/lib/pq/jobs/151114204\r\n\r\nThis is because of https://github.com/golang/tools/commit/edf8e6fef861d8c5ecc9e394b0146d6ebba57795\r\n\r\ngo1.4 isn't *actually* supported anymore, but people do still use it, that's why `lib/pq` tests against it.\r\n\r\nIf there is interest in \"fixing\" this I can submit a CL, otherwise `lib/pq` will either have to remove the goimports test and/or stop testing against go1.4",
