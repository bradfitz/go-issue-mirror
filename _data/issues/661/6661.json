	"body": "by **manoj.dayaram@moovweb.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nUnfortunately, I have not been able to create a simple example for this.  Instead, I can\nonly offer the information on this github issue: \n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/moovweb/gokogiri/issues/51\"\u003ehttps://github.com/moovweb/gokogiri/issues/51\u003c/a\u003e\n\nTo reproduce the error (hopefully!) perform these steps in a Darwin machine:\n1) go get -u github.com/moovweb/gokogiri\n2) cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/moovweb/gokogiri/xpath\n3) go test .\n\nFor most Darwin machines, the error should show up, but there's been a couple where the\ntests run successfully.\n\nThe gist of the problem is we have a Go function that we're exporting, then in embedded\nc code in a different file on the same package, we try to declare the header for that\nfunction and use it, however, when we do, we get the below listed compile time error.\n\nThe odd thing is that we're doing this with a bunch of different functions, but the only\none that complains is exec_xpath_function.  Commenting only the usage of that functions\nmakes the compiler happy.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nTo compile normally.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\ngokogiri/xpath(__TEXT/__text): unexpected GOT reloc for non-dynamic symbol\nexec_xpath_function\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g, 6l\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nDarwin\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nFails in all go versions tried, go1.0.3, go1.1, go1.2rc2\n\nThere's a lot more info in the github issue.  Basically this only seems to happen on\ncertain Darwin systems, not all.\n\nHere are the specs for a Darwin system where the error is found:\n\n$ clang --version\nApple clang version 3.0 (tags/Apple/clang-211.10.1) (based on LLVM 3.0svn)\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0\nThread model: posix\n\n$ system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType\nSoftware:\n\n    System Software Overview:\n\n      System Version: Mac OS X Server 10.6.8 (10K549)\n      Server Configuration: Advanced\n      Kernel Version: Darwin 10.8.0\n      Boot Volume: Server HD\n      Boot Mode: Normal\n      Computer Name: computer\n      User Name: user (user)\n      Secure Virtual Memory: Not Enabled\n      64-bit Kernel and Extensions: Yes\n      Time since boot: 34 days 3:36\n\n\nAnd the specs for a system where the error does NOT appear (aka, compiles normally):\n\n$ clang --version\nApple clang version 2.1 (tags/Apple/clang-163.7.1) (based on LLVM 3.0svn)\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin11.4.2\nThread model: posix\n\n$ system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType\nSoftware:\n\n    System Software Overview:\n\n      System Version: Mac OS X 10.7.5 (11G63)\n      Kernel Version: Darwin 11.4.2\n      Boot Volume: Macintosh HD\n      Boot Mode: Normal\n      Computer Name: computer\n      User Name: user (user)\n      Secure Virtual Memory: Enabled\n      64-bit Kernel and Extensions: Yes\n      Time since boot: 2 days 16:08\u003c/pre\u003e",
