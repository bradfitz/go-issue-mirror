It seems to\r\nme that this doesn't make much difference in practice.  You already\r\ncan not assign or implicitly convert between named struct types.\r\nUnnamed struct types are rarely used, so I don't see them as an\r\nissue.  If we reverted this CL, I think it would be possible to\r\nexplicitly convert between struct types as long as the fields had the\r\nsame names and types, because the underlying types would be identical.",
