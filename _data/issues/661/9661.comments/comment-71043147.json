See: https://gist.github.com/jbenet/5c191d698fe9ec58c49d -- the outcome changes if I wait before or after the `net.FileConn(f)` call. this is similar to #3838. (( Maybe I'm just waiting incorrectly? I use `syscall.Select` because `runtime_*` is not avail. )) The same fix as #3838 is not easy, as `raddr` is not directly available.",
