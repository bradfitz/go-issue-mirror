I will take a look at the HTML 5 spec and the package\nsource.\n\n\u0026gt;I don't know about the termination condition,\nthough - for example does \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; end the\nscript if it is inside a Javascript comment or\nstring literal?\n\nThat is a very good point, so for the tokenizer to work properly, it will most likely\nhave to somewhat parse javascript, at least enough to understand comments and string\nliterals. This also brings up the problem of other script types, like VBScript and Tcl,\nwhich I am guessing will cause the same problems.\n\nI definitely understand why you moved this issue to long term...I do not know how\nactively your team is working on this issue, but please let me know if you decide on\nwhat direction you are moving in for a solution. I would like to know this because I\nwant to focus my own research in that direction. Thanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
