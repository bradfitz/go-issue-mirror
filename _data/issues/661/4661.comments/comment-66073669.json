The only space character\nthat satisfies IsPrint is the ASCII space. IsPrint gets used by things like %q to decide\nwhether to escape a rune or not. By admitting only a single space character, we make\nsure that if you see something that looks like a space in a quoted string, it really is\nan ASCII space, not some other Unicode space. This applies to all kinds of spaces, not\njust Japanese spaces. For example, IsPrint('\\u00A0') is false too.\n\nIf you want to allow all kinds of spaces, use the Unicode-defined \"graphic\" property,\ncalled as unicode.IsGraphic.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
