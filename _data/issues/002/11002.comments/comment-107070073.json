Can you add the output of \"go build -x\"?\r\n\r\nGo is probably passing the -r option (as -Wl,-r), but I doubt it is passing the -shared option.  Go 1.4 never passes a -shared option.  We need to find out where -shared is coming from, and why.\r\n\r\nI have no idea why GCC and clang would be behaving differently here.  The error message is from the linker, and normally on GNU/Linux both GCC and clang use the same linker.",
