	"body": "Thanks.  It's a very misleading message from the GNU linker.  The actual problem is the -pie option.  The GNU linker rejects using -pie -r.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the GNU linker has no way to turn off a -pie option.  So we need to arrange for clang++ to not pass -pie to the linker.  That means we need to find out why it is doing it and how to disable it.\r\n\r\nThe version of clang++ installed on my system (3.4) does not pass a -pie option.  I can't find any evidence that LLVM likes to pass -pie on systems other than Android.\r\n\r\nDoes your system have a file /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-alpine-linux-musl/4.9.2/specs ?  If so, please add it here.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I think we need to pass this to the LLVM developers.  Why it LLVM passing -pie?  How can we get it to stop?",
