	"body": "Dist's \"bootstrap\" and \"install\" subcommands both support a -s flag to \"build static binaries\", but sflag doesn't appear to be used anywhere.  Seems like either: 1) the flag should be made to work, 2) the flag should be removed, or 3) the flag should be documented that it doesn't actually do anything.",
