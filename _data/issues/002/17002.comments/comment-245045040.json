I see the columns as 'name' and 'type', and so it makes logical sense to me that a name-less field should be lined up that way. The other side of the coin is that a nameless type uses the type as the name; ergo -- it's a name and belongs in the first column.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, you can write the type twice as a workaround:\r\n\r\n```Go\r\ntype thing {\r\n    rune    rune    // a character\r\n``",
