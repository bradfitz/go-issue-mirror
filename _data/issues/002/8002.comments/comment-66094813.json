Maybe\nthere is another way to achieve the same result.\n\n2. Rather than not clearing %SYSTEMROOT%, maybe we can fix rand.Read on _windows to\nstore the the environment variables it needs in another place. Maybe, i'm not sure. On\nunix os.ClearEnv() clears a *copy* of the environment variables, the original ones exist\nin their original location, but are ofcourse inaccessible to Go code.\u003c/pre\u003e",
