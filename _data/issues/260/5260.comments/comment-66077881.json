From the same (tip) specs link:\n\n\"Implementation restriction: For compatibility with other tools, a compiler may ignore a\nUTF-8-encoded byte order mark (U+FEFF) if it is the first Unicode code point in the\nsource text.\"\n\nNote the \"if it is the first Unicode code point in the source text\", in contrast to\nyours \"in the middle of a file\".\n\nOTOH, I don't think that the source code actually contains the BOM. '\\uFEFF' is a 6\nASCII char string, so the error message is some artifact of the compiler, I believe.\n\nHowever:\n\nOn Linux, I fortunately don't have to care about BOMs prepended to UTF-8 source code,\nbut I wonder how many Windows editors and/or IDEs and/or other tools correctly support\nBOM in the middle of a file.\n\nIt's IMO necessary to fix the compiler bug while not allowing BOM anywhere else than is\ncurrently allowed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
