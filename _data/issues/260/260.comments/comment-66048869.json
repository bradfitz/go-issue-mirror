The syscall package on Linux already has a binding for\nNanosleep; I changed the Sleep() call to use that instead of Select().  At least on\nmy test machine, it appears to be the case that this can indeed sleep for \u0026lt;10ms, but\nthere is a consistent 1.5-2ms overhead to the call.  That seems like a lot to me, but\ntests resulted in the sleep taking more than 1.5ms and less than 2ms longer than\nrequested, regardless of how long the sleep was supposed to be for.  Note that this\nis as measured by the above tester program, so any flaws in my code would affect that\nresult.\n\nThis works for my purposes, but I am not sure aliasing Sleep to Nanosleep is a good\ngeneral policy.  Both are available in the syscall package anyway.  I do still\nsupport documenting the specifics of Sleep's current behavior as well as any\nlong-term guarantees it makes.  Even if the former does not belong in the official\nAPI documentation, it's still good information to have around somewhere.\u003c/pre\u003e",
