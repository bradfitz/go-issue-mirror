There is probably some measurable overhead in the\nenter / exit syscall routines called by the syscall wrappers in the go runtime.\n\nI don't think aliasing Sleep to Nanosleep is a good policy, and I agree that the best\nsolution may be to simply document the behavior, and make it clear that there is no\nreal-time enforcement (which would imply that it would return at latest the amount of\ntime you requested).\n\n--dho\u003c/pre\u003e",
