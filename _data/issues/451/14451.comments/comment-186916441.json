See https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/555\r\n\r\nBTW, `PRI * HTTP/2.0` is a valid Request-Line. It's a 400 Bad Request because the lack of `Host: ...` line.\r\n\r\nWe should probably special-case the http2 client preface as not requiring a Host header, though.\r\n\r\nI'll repurpose this bug for that.\r\n",
