	"body": "Given a block like\r\n\r\n```go\r\nif condition {\r\n  // basic block\r\n  panic(...)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe should mark `condition` as unlikely. Unlikely to make a huge difference, but many things in the runtime have guards like this; we may as well help the branch predictor. Inspired by CL 11541.\r\n",
