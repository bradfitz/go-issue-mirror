Currently only\nsupports linux, but making watchers for other operating systems should be trivial; they\nneed only satisfy the Watcher interface (see the README). Supports Modify, Delete, and\nCreate events currently. A Move event is planned, but not implemented for InotifyWatcher.\n\nLet me know if you have any feedback or concerns about this API. Repository is at\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/crazy2be/fsmon\"\u003ehttps://github.com/crazy2be/fsmon\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e",
