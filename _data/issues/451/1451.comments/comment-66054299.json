We do need to move this to golang-nuts.\n\nAlex, thanks for the links - I do have all that installed, just having some errors in\nsome tests. Hopefully will figure it out soon.\n\ncrazy2be, to receive events that a directory or subdirectory was modified in Windows you\nuse FindFirstChangeNotification/FindNextChangeNotification. It returns a handle that you\nwait on using WaitForSingleObject or WaitForMultipleObjects. You still have to use\nReadDirectoryChanges to get the specific changes - these other functions just give your\nthread a way to wake up when changes happen.\n\nI personally like the initial inotify interface using one channel. Using a channel seems\nmore idiomatic for Go. Because you can filter the events, it seems odd to break them\ninto multiple channels - you'd have channels that never have messages. Plus, multiple\nevents could happen on the same file, and I am not 100% sure but I think the events can\nbe combined.\n\nI'll start a topic on golang-nuts.\u003c/pre\u003e",
