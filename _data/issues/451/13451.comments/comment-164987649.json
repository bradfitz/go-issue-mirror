Some of your examples above look very allocation-happy.\r\n\r\nBefore accepting this proposal, I'd want to see before \u0026 after programs with numbers and profiles to show that it helps enough. There will definitely be pushback about expanding the net package's API, which many feel is already too large.\r\n\r\nThat is, convince us with data perhaps. Implement this in the net package and then show us numbers with how much it helped. We have to be able to reproduce the numbers.\r\n\r\n",
