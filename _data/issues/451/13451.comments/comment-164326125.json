SRS is really very high efficient for use writev to avoid copy and use little syscall. But SRS is single process model, for steaming server is too complex.\r\n\r\nNginx-RTMP which is a plugin in nginx, which only support 2k clients per CPU, but nginx-rtmp support multiple-processes.\r\n\r\nI create go-oryx, because I want to use the multile processes feature of golang. Right now,  after lots of performance refine, the go-oryx can support 8k by 4CPU. If golang support writev, I think the performance can improve 200% to 400%, that is about 16k to 32k clients use 4CPU. It's really awesome.",
