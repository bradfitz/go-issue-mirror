	"body": "@winlinvip, thanks for prototyping.\r\n\r\nCan you make a small stand-alone program for profiling that can do either multiple writes or writev (controlled by a flag) and link to the code so others can reproduce your results and investigate more?\r\n\r\nI also have an API idea. Instead of adding API like `(*TCPConn).Writev([][]byte)`, we could have a special type that implements `io.WriterTo` that represents the multiple buffers (the `[][]byte`) and TCPConn's `ReadFrom` can special-case it into a writev internally, just like it does `sendfile`. \r\n\r\nThen we can add the writev optimization gradually to different OS/conn types over time.\r\n",
