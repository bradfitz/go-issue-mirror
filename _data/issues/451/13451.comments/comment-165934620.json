For example, \"proposal: net: do blah blah\" (see https://github.com/golang/proposal for further information) because I'm still not sure what's the original objective; it's just to have scatter-gather IO APIs, or more stuff including fancy packet assembly framework and primitives. A few random thoughts.\r\n\r\n1. Please use sendmsg instead of writev internally. Both have the same scatter-gather functionality but sendmsg is more useful for datagram-based unconnected-mode sockets and we can reuse it for #7882 later.\r\n\r\n2. I think it's fine to have different scatter-gather IO APIs between stream-based connected-mode sockets and datagram-based unconnected-mode sockets because as @ianlancetaylor mentioned, interfaces defined in io package are not designed for the latter. Fortunately we can use UDPConn in both styles by using two connection setup functions Dial and ListenPacket appropriately.",
