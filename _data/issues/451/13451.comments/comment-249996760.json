The whole point of `io.ReaderFrom` and `io.WriterTo` was to optimize `io.Copy`, so it feels weird to have any `WriterTo` which is not a `Reader`.\r\n\r\nBut I can't make `net.Buffers` a `Reader` because then it would need a pointer receiver and record state, which is kinda disgusting, especially if the `writev` `EAGAIN` loop already needs to maintain that state (see the CL). I'd prefer that state be local to the loop and not required to be allocated by the user in every write call, since the whole point of this is to avoid allocations.\r\n",
