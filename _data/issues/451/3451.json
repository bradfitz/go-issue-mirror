	"body": "by **blake.mizerany**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI’ve been slowly working on migrating more of Heroku’s codebase over to Go. One of\nmy more Ruby-centric coworkers just wasted several hours today on Go’s lack of support\nfor this regular expression:\n\n    var validRequest = regexp.MustCompile(`^/customer/(\\w+)/(\\w+)?authas=\\1(\u0026amp;.*)?`)\n\nAfter tweaking, I’ve narrowed it down to this minimal repro case:\n\n   var r = regexp.MustCompile(`^(a).+\\1`)\n\nThat works fine in Ruby:\n\n$ irb\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026quot;abba\u0026quot;.match(/^(a).+\\1/)\n=\u0026gt; #\u0026lt;MatchData \u0026quot;abba\u0026quot; 1:\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n\nWhy doesn’t this work in Go?\n\nNot to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I’ll have a harder time getting co-workers\nto adopt Go if such basic things from Ruby aren’t even supported.\u003c/pre\u003e",
