	"body": "I have search go-nuts and google about the writev for unix, seems go not support it yet. And I found a project [vectorio](https://github.com/tedb/vectorio) which support writev but not work.\r\n\r\nI am rewriting the [srs](https://github.com/ossrs/srs) to [go-oryx](https://github.com/ossrs/go-oryx/pull/20#issuecomment-161247400). SRS can support 7.5k clients per CPU, while golang version only support 2k, for the media streaming server need to delivery the video or audio packet to different parts, then use writev to send to client to avoid bytes copy.\r\n\r\nI try to use reflect to implements the writev, but I found it's possible for the pollDesc is not exported, the commit is [here](https://github.com/ossrs/go-oryx/commit/2469d5e6aca4b3b4c95af582bfb83fb2b2f1c0b7).\r\n\r\nDoes go plan to support writev(netFD.Writev)?",
