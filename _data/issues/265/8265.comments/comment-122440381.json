The default generator, at the moment, is MakeCert.exe, so if that utility is generating negative serial numbers (and it appears to, even on Windows 10) you could still encounter this issue. One clarification though: Makecert isn't a part of Windows itself; it calls the CAPI apis. I believe it was last publicly shipped as a VS2008 redistributable, although some programs like Fiddler still bundle it.\r\n\r\nCurrent versions of Fiddler allow you to either use the CertMaker add-on (http://www.fiddler2.com/r/?fiddlercertmaker), or use the Win7+ CertEnroll interfaces (click Tools \u003e Fiddler Options \u003e HTTPS and click the blue hyperlink \"Default certificate maker\" and select CertEnroll). The former definitely won't give you a negative serial number and the latter shouldn't (CertEnroll is generally higher quality than makecert.exe).\r\n\r\nNow, having said all that, makecert-generated certs seem to be pretty widespread; the Mozilla guys backed out one of their recent changes to accommodate another quirk of such certificates (see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1042479)\r\n\r\nOn a quick test Win10, makecert.exe generated a certificate with the following serial number:\r\n   \r\n    a633fb4f da68a188 42816c76 b2482cc4\r\n\r\n\r\n",
