	"body": "### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\ngo version go1.7.1 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOOS=\"darwin\"\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\n\r\nI am working on an HTTP/2 client for Apple's push notification service. When using [JWT tokens](https://jwt.io/) to authenticate, Apple initially sends maxConcurrentStreams = 1. Once authentication is complete they send maxConcurrentStreams = 500 (though this number may vary).\r\n\r\nCurrently I have a worker pool to send multiple requests concurrently. If I could monitor the maxConcurrentStreams, I would know how big the worker pool should be -- or how many workers should be active.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nAccess to maxConcurrentStreams via httptrace or some other x/net/http2 API.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/http2/transport.go#L1735\r\n\r\nPossibly related: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13774\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nIf I send more requests than maxConcurrentStreams dictates\r\n\r\nWith Go 1.7.1 http.DefaultClient I am getting the following error.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp2: server sent GOAWAY and closed the connection; LastStreamID=1, ErrCode=REFUSED_STREAM, \r\ndebug=\"Maximum active streams violated for this endpoint.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the latest `x/net/http2` I'm getting slightly different errors (still looking into these).\r\n\r\n```\r\n2016/09/28 10:14:43 (9) device: [my-token], error: Post https://api.development.push.apple.com/3/device/[my-token]: \r\nhttp2: no cached connection was available\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n2016/09/28 10:14:43 (11) device: [my-token], \r\nerror: invalid character 'M' looking for beginning of value\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn any case, the best I can do is prime the connection with a single request, and then send some number of concurrent requests, but not really knowing how many I can send.\r\n",
