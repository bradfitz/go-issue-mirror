What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n     1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\n    GOOS=linux\r\n    GOARCH=amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\n    https://play.golang.org/p/M93SytJouJ\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n    An error message telling me that what I did was stupid.\r\n    E.g.: \"Cannot concatenate identifier 'fmt'\"\r\n\r\n5.
