By combining the operations in a single atomic call, they more closely match the 9P protocol (see intro(5)) and, more important, permit multiprocess programs to execute **multiple concurrent read and write operations on the same file descriptor without interference.**\r\n\r\nSo it seems like the normal `pread` or `io.ReaderAt` semantics.\r\n",
