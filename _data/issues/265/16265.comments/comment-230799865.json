	"body": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.4 also says:\r\n\r\n\u003e A client MUST send a Host header field in all HTTP/1.1 request\r\n\u003e messages.  If the target URI includes an authority component, then a\r\n\u003e client MUST send a field-value for Host that is identical to that\r\n\u003e authority component\r\n\r\nGo is forcing the two values to be the same.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there's even an old comment in the code about this in `net/http/request.go`:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n        // RFC 2616: Must treat                                                                                                               \r\n        //      GET /index.html HTTP/1.1                                                                                                      \r\n        //      Host: www.google.com                                                                                                          \r\n        // and                                                                                                                                \r\n        //      GET http://www.google.com/index.html HTTP/1.1                                                                                 \r\n        //      Host: doesntmatter                                                                                                            \r\n        // the same. In the second case, any Host line is ignored.                                                                            \r\n        req.Host = req.URL.Host\r\n        if req.Host == \"\" {\r\n                req.Host = req.Header.get(\"Host\")\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I think this is working as intended. Feel free to clarify if I misunderstood something.\r\n\r\n",
