	"body": "I occasionally write tests for constructs which, if they are buggy, could deadlock. I prefer to have my own timeout because then (a) the user can quickly recognize that the test has failed after only, say, 1 second instead of waiting for a very long timeout (default of 10 minutes), and (b) the message can clearly describe the failure.\r\n\r\nFor an example of such a test, I think that [`TestWaitGroup` in the stdlib](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b3bf38e79d71784d98a79f2c2e3af003f48c8052/src/sync/waitgroup_test.go#L36) would hang for the default timeout on certain kinds of bugs. (Maybe small timeouts wouldn't be desirable for standard library tests given @minux's point about needing to run on arbitrarily slow machines, but hopefully it's an illustrative example.)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to do `t.Timeout(time.Second)` rather than explicitly making a goroutine in such cases.",
