Run tests\n3. os/user test fail\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nTests don't fail\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n--- FAIL: TestCurrent (0.00 seconds)\n\tuser_test.go:39: expected a valid HomeDir; stat(\u0026quot;/home/buildd\u0026quot;): err=stat /home/buildd: no such file or directory\nFAIL\nFAIL\tos/user\t0.010s\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nN/A\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux, buildd architecture\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nGo1\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nFull build log:\n\u003ca href=\"https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=golang\u0026amp\"\u003ehttps://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=golang\u0026amp\u003c/a\u003e;arch=i386\u0026amp;ver=2%3A1-3\u0026amp;stamp=1334185838\n\nWhile I can fix that pretty easily (at least I hope that you use $HOME and don't parse\n/etc/passwd), I don't think that this test should hard FAIL is there is no homedirectory\nfor the user.\n\nAnyway feel free to close this bug report if you disagree ;).\u003c/pre\u003e",
