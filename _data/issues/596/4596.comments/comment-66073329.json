I hadn't considered the admin rights problem.\n\nThe system could prompt the user, perhaps?\n\n\"Race detection has not been installed. If you have admin rights to the system, Go can\ninstall race detection for you automatically. Would you like to proceed? [y/n]\"\n\nIf they choose yes, it installs race detection.\nIf they choose no, it displays information on how to have someone with admin access\ninstall it manually.\n\nThis approach would make it just as easy to automatically install it while also dealing\nwith the case where the user does not have admin rights.\n\nI would be happy to give the auto install functionality a look and see what I can come\nup with, if you guys think that is an approach you would like to take.\u003c/pre\u003e",
