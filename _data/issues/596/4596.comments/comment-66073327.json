Would it be\npossible to build the race packages from what has been installed to the system? If so,\nthe following could work:\n\n1. User attempts to use race detection\n2. If race detection is not installed:\n    a. If the user is connected to the internet, download the pre-compiled race packages and install them.\n    b. If the user is not connected to the internet, build the race packages locally and install them.\n3. Run the command they originally used.\n\nThis approach would solve the problem of size bloat in the initial downloaded package\nwhile still allowing those people who want to use race detection to use it without any\nfurther effort on their part as the process would be automatic.\n\nThoughts?\u003c/pre\u003e",
