Instead, I now think it may be a goinstall\nissue.\n\nFor the bisection, my rebuilding process was\ncd $(GOROOT)/src\n./make.bash\ngoinstall -a\ncd $(TESTDIR)\nmake\n\nbut I don't think the goinstall -a was doing what I thought (it never complained, but I\nran it manually and did not check the exit status) and it might have left old builds\naround or something.  When I tried goinstall -clean=true -a just now I got this:\n\n~/devel/svgo (master)$ goinstall -clean=true -a\ngoinstall: === cd /Users/tarm/devel/go/src/pkg/bitbucket.org/taruti/termios; gomake -f-\nclean install\nrm -rf *.o *.a *.[568vq] [568vq].out *.so _obj _test _testmain.go *.exe _cgo* *.cgo[12].*\n8g -o _go_.8 getline.go \ngetline.go:25: undefined: CurrentTerminal\nmake: *** [_go_.8] Error 1\n--- exit status 2\ngoinstall: installing bitbucket.org/taruti/termios: running gomake: exit status 2\n\n\n# removes failing pkg from goinstall.log and pkg/... and src/pkg/....\n\n~/devel/svgo (master)$ goinstall -clean=true -a\n~/devel/svgo (master)$\n\nAnd now both svgo and my application build correctly.\n\nSorry about the false alarm.  I'm still not sure what happened but it now seems\ngoinstall related to me.\n\nThanks,\nTarmigan\u003c/pre\u003e",
