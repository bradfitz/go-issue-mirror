I believe this API is more useful in\npractice and will make your case, as well as others, simpler.  ASCII performance is\nworse, but for other character sets performance is similar or even better and it is\nfairly simple to optimize the ASCII case.  See \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/6873072\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/6873072\u003c/a\u003e\nfor details.  This CL includes an example that shows how to implement EqualNorm in your\ncase.\u003c/pre\u003e",
