Code inspection and strace locally suggest that persistentalloc addresses should be more like 0xc4xxxxxxxx.\r\n\r\n0xc4... is where the Go heap lives, but persistentalloc uses whatever the kernel returns for a non-MAP_FIXED mapping.\r\n\r\n\u003e The most recent panic was associated with a kernel BUG message, so likely not a go issue.\r\n\r\nHuh. I was spiraling in on this being a kernel bug, but that's not an accusation I wanted to make lightly. :) Glad you found the BUG in the kernel log!\r\n\r\nI found some other reports of page table corruption with kernels around 3.13, such as https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/4/8/173, so I suspect this has been fixed in the kernel.\r\n\r\nIf this turns out to be a real problem, I suspect we can track down the exact path through the kernel that caused this using the print_bad_pte output from your kernel log.",
