I said an 'm stack' pointer, which should\nnot be found on an ordinary goroutine stack and certainly not in the middle of a JSON\nstructure.\n\nI think we've spent as much time as we can on this and aren't going to get anywhere\nwithout being able to see and run the code ourselves. There may be a bug on our side,\nand if so I'd like to fix it, but so far there's no evidence it's not a problem in your\ncode.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-none**, removed **release-go1.3**._",
