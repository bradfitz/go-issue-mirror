I've tried to\nrecreate it based on the traces, I see that there is \"slice -\u003e ptr -\u003e struct -\u003e slice -\u003e\ninterface\", here is what I've got:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/y45Zs0kd4D\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/y45Zs0kd4D\u003c/a\u003e\nBut it does not crash.\ntoffaletti, please try to modify this program as close to your real code as possible (in\nterms of data types, structure of the object that you serialize and how you call\nreflect.Marshall). And see if you can reproduce the crash on that program. If we would\nbe able to reproduce it on such a small program, then would allow us to debug it quickly.\u003c/pre\u003e",
