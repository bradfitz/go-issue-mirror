However, I wanted to update and say I unravelled the twisty maze of\nassignments the *Image goes through and at no point was the pointer dereferenced so I\nwas wrong about there being a racy copy of the Image struct fields. I was also able to\nreproduce the crash after removing all concurrent assignment to the Image struct fields,\nso there goes that theory.\u003c/pre\u003e",
