I don't actually see a problem in your playground code, though\nI may not have looked closely enough.  It's OK to set a field in a struct and then send\na value on a channel indicating that the struct is initialized.  When the channel value\nis received, the receiving goroutine can safely examine the struct fields.\u003c/pre\u003e",
