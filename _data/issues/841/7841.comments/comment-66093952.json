I suspect the servers interaction with the GC is just too\ncomplex to simulate with simplified code.\n\nIn a moment of clarity I had the idea of turning off the GC. With GOGC=off I am unable\nto reproduce the crash, so I think we're on the right track blaming the GC.\n\nIs there any debugging I can turn on to help diagnose the issue?\nCan I rule out parts of the new GC by building Go at specific commits and test\nbefore/after behavior?\u003c/pre\u003e",
