Some of the\n[]interface{} are assigned to types that then reference the parent or other types that\nreference them, however the cycles are always hidden behind interface{}.\n\nSorry I can't be of more help. This code is quite complex and there is a good deal of it\nthat probably isn't even being used anymore. I plan on trying to remove a lot of the\ndead code and once that is done perhaps I'll be able to distill it down to something\nthat crashes which I am able to share, but don't count on it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
