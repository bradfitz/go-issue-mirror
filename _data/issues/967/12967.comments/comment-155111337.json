	"body": "@RLH and I were talking about another solution that sort of combines @randall77's first suggestion and @ianlancetaylor's suggestion: reserve a few words in the sudog for receiving small values (which are presumably the majority of channel ops) and otherwise allocate space on the heap for a slot. The receiver would then copy the value in to its own stack when it wakes up. This would eliminate cross-stack writes, at the cost of slightly larger sudogs and a heap allocation for passing large values.",
