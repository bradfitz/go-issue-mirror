It looks\napproximately like this:\n\nSUM: OP \" + \" OP ;\nDIFF: OP \" - \" OP ;\n\nI.e. people use string tokens as an easy way to recognize strings. This can, of course\nbe replaced by the way I described in #0 or by putting them into lexer, but that\nrequires a bit more effort and decreases readability. That is especially relevant in the\npresence of the fact that we don't have lexer yet (do we?).\n\nBesides, it seems that cmd/yacc already has some support for it - so why not just fix it?\u003c/pre\u003e",
