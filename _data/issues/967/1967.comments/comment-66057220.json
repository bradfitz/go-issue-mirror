Thank you so much for that.\n\nI spent a good day rewriting the http package so that the body struct would have a\nReadCloser instead of a Reader. I should point out that I had no success.\n\nI just did a quick test supplying a custom Dial function and it did close the connection.\n\nBefore going I should point to this:\n\n---\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html\"\u003ehttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html\u003c/a\u003e\n\n8.1.4 Practical Considerations\n\n...\n\nWhen a client or server wishes to time-out it SHOULD issue a graceful close on the\ntransport connection. Clients and servers SHOULD both constantly watch for the other\nside of the transport close, and respond to it as appropriate. If a client or server\ndoes not detect the other side's close promptly it could cause unnecessary resource\ndrain on the network. \n\n---\n\nI think you should put in the documentation somewhere that connections won't be closed.\nI'm sure there are some other people that have gotten into difficulties by pre-emptively\nclosing a connection.\n\nAgain, thank you.\u003c/pre\u003e",
