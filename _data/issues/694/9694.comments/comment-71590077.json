At least give us contributors a chance to think it through and try to contribute a patch.  We can then discuss the merit of the patch (e.g. one that detects a working sendfile() rather than merely detecting whether we are inside VirtualBox), and decide whether we want to use it or not, and **only then** we close this issue.",
