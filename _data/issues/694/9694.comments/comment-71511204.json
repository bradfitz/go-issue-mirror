Sadly, there doesn't seem to have been any progress on the [VirtualBox issue](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/9069) in four years.\r\n\r\nI like your idea, however I imagine it wouldn't solve the problem for boot2docker.  If the application using sendfile was running within a Docker container via VirtualBox, I'm not sure you could detect that shared folders in VirtualBox were being used.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't have a better suggestion.  Nginx and Apache do offer the option to disable sendfile, so I'm wondering if there could be another reason for them to provide it.\r\n\r\nWould it be out of consideration for golang to do the same?  I believe it's pretty normal to use shared folders with boot2docker, and a matter of time before other go applications run into this issue.\r\n\r\nUnless, of course, there is a way to detect if Docker is running within VirtualBox shared folders.",
