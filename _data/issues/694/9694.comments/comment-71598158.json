The problem is not that sendfile doesn't work at all inside VirtualBox, but it doesn't work properly on files from shared folder.\r\n\r\nThank you for your detailed explanation.  I have indeed missed the part about this bug manifesting itself only when inside a VirtualBox shared folder, and it would be unfeasible and even dubious if Go were to try to detect that.\r\n\r\n@slimsag, You're right, this is really a VirtualBox bug and should be fixed in VirtualBox.\r\n\r\nThank you all for an illuminating lesson.",
