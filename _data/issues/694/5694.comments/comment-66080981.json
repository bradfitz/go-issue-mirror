As far as I remember, we had similar problems with go builder, and\nhere \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/misc/dashboard/builder/main.go#431\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/misc/dashboard/builder/main.go#431\u003c/a\u003e is\nwhat we do now. My suggestion is just leave environment along on windows - rewrite\nenvironment variables you need to rewrite, and copy the rest as is.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
