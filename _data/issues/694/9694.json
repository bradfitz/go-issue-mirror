	"body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nAn issue \"Cannot see updated files from public/ in VirtualBox shared folders\" https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/841 has been reported to the Hugo project.  @itoed, the original reporter, has correctly deduced the culprit as a long-time bug in VirtualBox with its sendfile() support, which both Apache and Nginx have provided workarounds for by allowing the end user to disable the use of sendfile().\r\n\r\nI think it affects other Go web applications running inside VirtualBox too, so it would appear to me that the best place to fix this is in ReadFrom() inside src/net/tcpsock_posix.go, perhaps by making the use of OS-optimized sendfile() a user-configurable option?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your kind consideration!",
