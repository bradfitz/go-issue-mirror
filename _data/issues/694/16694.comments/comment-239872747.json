	"body": "I argue that this is contrary to the spirit of the Go 1 guarantee, in that I had code that previously worked and did not depend on any unusual behaviour of the language or the library, and now my code breaks. My code isn't widely-used, so perhaps that doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nGranted the wording of the guarantee allows for undefined cases in the API. But since the API is defined to take a _value_ implementing `flag.Value` rather than a _type_, I think that wouldn't be a good use of the exception.\r\n\r\nI understand this can't be fixed for the 1.7 release, but I claim it's still a bug, and that documentation isn't an adequate fix in the long term.",
