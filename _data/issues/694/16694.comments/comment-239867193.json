	"body": "The problem fixed by that commit: when the default value of a flag is the zero value, don't report the default value in the usage message.  I don't want to unwind that commit (it's too late to unwind it for the 1.7 release in any case) and I definitely don't want to start catching a panic in that code.\r\n\r\nIt's a subtle property in this case, but as you know in general we strongly encourage Go types to have valid zero values (https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#allocation_new).",
