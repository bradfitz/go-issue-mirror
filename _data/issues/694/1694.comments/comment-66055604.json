Instead of overloading SO_REUSEADDR with the\ndesired multicast semantics that allow completely duplicate bindings,\nthis new socket option was introduced with the following semantics:\n\n1) This option allows completely duplicate bindings, but only if each\nsocket that wants to bind the same IP address and port specify this\nsocket option.\n\n2) SO_REUSEADDR is considered equivalent to SO_REUSEPORT if the IP\naddress being bound is a multicast address (p. 731 of TCPv2).\n\u0026lt;/q\u0026gt;\u003c/pre\u003e",
