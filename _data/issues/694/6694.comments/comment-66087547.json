If you tell it to build something\nin one workspace it will not build stale things in other workspaces. With one exception:\nif the thing in the other workspace has never been built at all, the go command will\nbuild it instead of failing.\n\nIf you have one workspace per project you are not using them in the intended manner,\nwhich will make the tools work less well for you. See \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/code.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/code.html\u003c/a\u003e\nfor an overview.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
