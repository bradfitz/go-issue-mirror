For example, if the capacity of id is larger than it's\nlength at line Y, assume j is a, then the after line Y, the id field\nwill use the same backing array of the id variable, when line X\nexecutes, i will overwrite j, which will also change the id field\nof last appended S_1 struct.\n\n\nPlease ask questions on the mailing list or forum, not\non issue tracker, esp. when you're learning Go.\nSee https://golang.org/wiki/Questions.\n",
