	"body": "Hello everyone (reading this) :smiley: \r\n\r\nI'm building a tool that fetches a URL from a POST endpoint, which returns a `303 - See other` response with the wanted URL in the `Location` header. Sometimes this `Location` itself returns a 301.\r\n\r\nHere's the issue: Go seems to process the redirect from the `303` just fine, per line 253 of the source:\r\nhttp://golang.org/src/net/http/client.go\r\n\r\nBut once we get to the `301`, Go still checks if it should redirect with the function used for POST requests. So it doesn't actually redirect the 301, even though it got there through a GET request (see line 341 of the source).\r\n\r\nThis seems odd to me. Seems like it could be a bug. Am I missing something? If this is a bug, would a fix for this make sense considering BC?\r\n\r\n*I'm posting this on behalf of my current employer, shopping24 GmbH.*",
