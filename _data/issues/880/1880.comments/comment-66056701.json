This issue is closed, please raise a new issue.\n\nHaving said that, I believe you are cross compiling from non arm to arm, and your gcc is\ncomplaining because it only known hows to compile for x86/x64. The short answer to this\nis, when cross compiling for arm, pass CGO_ENABLED=0 to disable cgo. If you need cgo on\narm, you will have to compile on arm directly.\u003c/pre\u003e",
