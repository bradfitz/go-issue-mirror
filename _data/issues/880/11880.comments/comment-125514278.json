	"body": "Thanks for the detailed explanation! We have already a workaround which traverses all comments through the AST, remembers them, and then traverses all comments which have not been visited. This is needed because we analyse comments differently if they belong to a declaration.\r\n\r\nI am wondering if these changes to the AST and ast.Walk can be implemented at all because of the backwards-compatible promise? Also, do comments really have to appear \"with\" a node? Can't they just reside inside the AST as an ordinary node? Additionally the position information must be somehow somewhere correct, because using go/printer will output the correct source even after a modification, or is this assumption wrong?",
