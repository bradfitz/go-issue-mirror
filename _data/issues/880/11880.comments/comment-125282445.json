	"body": "@zimmski The AST walker only visits comments that were associated with nodes (excluding the list of all comments that's in ast.File). At this point, only comments above declarations, and line comments in declarations (e.g. structs) are associated with the respective nodes; i.e., the parser assumes that those comments \"belong\" to those nodes.\r\n\r\nIn general, the parser doesn't make any further assumptions about other comments and does not associate them with any nodes (this is indeed a major shortcoming of the existing AST and we're investigating how to remedy this situation, possibly via a new AST representation).\r\n\r\nWalk could be made more sophisticated and walk comments as they appear by position, relative to the other nodes. But this requires that position information is 100% correct (which is not always the case when the AST is manipulated after creation). It also is not clear with which node a comment should appear (this is something a future heuristic would have to address).\r\n\r\nIf you want to walk all comments, it's trivial to a) ignore comments encountered by Walk, and b) simply traverse the list of all comments attached to ast.File (i.e., the list of comments in ast.File contains _all_ comments, even the ones associated with other nodes).\r\n\r\nClosing this for now since it's working as originally intended; and with the understanding that a future implementation needs to do a better job.\r\n",
