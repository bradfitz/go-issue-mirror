	"body": "by **hadrien.grasland**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhile browsing the golang.org website, I was unable to find a satisfactory documentation\nof the run-time requirements of Go programs.\n\nI did explore the \u0026quot;tiny\u0026quot; toy OS kernel example of the Go source tree, but it\nis now deprecated. The \u0026quot;How is the run-time support implemented?\u0026quot; FAQ entry,\non its side, only provides compiler-specific data, and with no guarantee that it will\nremain valid in the future.\n\nI believe that documenting these in the spec (the \u0026quot;System considerations\u0026quot;\nsection comes to mind) is important if Go is to be used for system programming tasks. As\nof now, there is no way to clearly draw the line between what can be implemented in Go\nand what must be implemented in a lower-level language like C or C++, in a manner that\nwon't change in the future. There is also no way to guarantee that switching or\nupgrading compilers won't break existing Go system software by suddenly adding more\nrun-time requirements.\u003c/pre\u003e",
