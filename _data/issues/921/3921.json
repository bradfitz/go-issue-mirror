	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eOn GNU/Linux it might be slightly more efficient to use the sched_getaffinity system\ncall to get the number of virtual processors.  It would be one system call instead of\nthree or more, and it would not touch the filesystem.  The function, getproccount in\nruntime/thread_linux.c, is called at the start of every program.\n\nBut note that if the system is actually using CPU affinity, this will cause\nruntime.NumCPU to return the number of virtual processors that the process is permitted\nto run on, rather than the number of virtual processors on the system.\u003c/pre\u003e",
