It omits all the C\nand assembly implementation objects.  (The runtime.a that is built contains only _go_.8,\nno other .8 files.)  Does /usr/lib/go/src/pkg/runtime have any .c or .s files in it?\n\nNot having the C or assembly objects in runtime.a is what causes the morestack undefined\nerrors.\n\nDid you unpack the tree into /usr/lib/go or did you only copy certain files?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
