If the source exists and the binary does not, compile the source.\n3. If the source exists and is newer than the binary _and_ you are\nworking in a directory inside the GOROOT, recompile the source.\n\nI believe you are working outside the GOROOT, so #3 does not apply.\n\nWhat does 'go env' print in both cases?\nIn your earlier mail you were trying to run a 64-bit (amd64) Go with\n32-bit (386) pre-compiled packages.  My guess is that the same thing\nis happening here.\nIf 'go env' says GOARCH=\"amd64\" then you need pkg/linux_amd64.  If 'go\nenv' says GOARCH=\"386\" then you need pkg/linux_386.\n\nTo understand more about what the go command thinks of a given package\n(say, fmt), run 'go list -json fmt'.  Does the \"Target\" exist?\u003c/pre\u003e",
