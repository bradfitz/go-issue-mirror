But I think that if\nthese 3 are the only ones that need this sort of fix, it's still worth it, mostly to\nkeep existing code from failing. \n\nNow, if you tell me that there are like 5 other functions that have the same problem,\nthen yes, it becomes somewhat pointless to fix them. But if it's limited to these 3, why\nnot go for it?\u003c/pre\u003e",
