Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version devel +dcbbd31 Thu Sep 22 06:41:11 2016 +0000 linux/ppc64le\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nUbuntu 16.04 ppc64le\r\n\r\nLooking at generated code for code improvements.\r\n\r\nThis appears in many procedures and is never used (example found in runtime.c64hash):\r\nDue to:\r\n   v26 = LoadReg \u003cunsafe.Pointer\u003e v8 : R3\r\n    v10 = LoweredNilCheck \u003cvoid\u003e v26 v1\r\n\r\nasm:\r\n MOVB    (R3), R31\r\n\r\nWith generated code:\r\n 11534:       00 00 e3 8b     lbz     r31,0(r3)\r\n   11538:       74 07 ff 7f     extsb   r31,r31\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what it's purpose is.  To avoid the extsb I believe I can just change this to a MOVD instead of a MOVB for the LoweredNilCheck, but r31 is never used in this function and the pointer for r3 is never dereferenced.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
