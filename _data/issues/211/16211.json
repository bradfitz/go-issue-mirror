	"body": "gomobile stripped NDKs created by release.go are still smaller than the android full NDK.\r\nBut \r\n- it adds maintenance overhead. \r\n- go starts supporting more architectures so stripped NDK is no longer tiny.\r\n- some users want to choose android api level different from the default the stripped NDK contains.\r\n\r\nI propose to remove the need of stripped NDK.\r\nNow gomobile can reuse cached NDKs, so I don't expect the tool to require users to download it for every init command.\r\n\r\nUnclear issue is \r\nwhat to do about open-AL tar file gomobile init also downloads?\r\n\r\n@crawshaw @eliasnaur @rakyll \r\n",
