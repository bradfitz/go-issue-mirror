But as far as I understand, the\nO_CLOEXEC stuff was backported to later versions of RHEL/CentOS 5 (5.2 or 5.3), so these\ncould actually be supported:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.held.org.il/blog/2008/03/glibc-27-on-centos-rhel-5/\"\u003ehttp://www.held.org.il/blog/2008/03/glibc-27-on-centos-rhel-5/\u003c/a\u003e \n\nWhere I wrote \"Go version\" I meant that the C tools could use an open function\nimplemented in C outside of glibc. Maybe the same trick as for memcpy could be used.\n\nIt could be nice to solve this problem so that anybody building a binary distro for\nothers (think of someone distributing Go+go.crypto+other dependencies+patches to an\ninternal team in a company) has a good chance of producing a build that will work on\nmost machines.\u003c/pre\u003e",
