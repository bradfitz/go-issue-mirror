All I did was document a bit of research here that suggested that the\nbarrier to supporting a widely used distribution (especially if you include other\nderivatives like CentOS, Scientific Linux, Oracle's distro, etc.) with this binary\ndistro isn't very high. You are completely free to disregard this information or\ndisagree about the height of the barrier. You are free to choose to not support these\ndistros. As has been said, users of these distributions are then free to puzzle over the\nerrors they will see when running this binary distribution, after which they are free to\nbuild from source. At least a quick Google on their part might turn up this discussion.\n:-)\u003c/pre\u003e",
