They are slowed down and time out.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this problem is related to Go or the Plan 9 kernel.\r\n\r\nWhen I increase the timeout to 480s, all.rc passes successfully,\r\nexcept the `TestKillChildAfterCopyError` test in `net/http/cgi`,\r\nwhich have his own timeout.\r\n\r\nWith multiprocessing disabled, I increased the timeout to 240s\r\nand all.rc passed successfully.\r\n\r\nSo, the issue is just that Go is slower on GCE than on QEMU\r\nor real hardware. I think we should just increase the timeout\r\nin run.rc.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
