Maybe we'll test at least that all commits compile for Plan 9 (or cross-compile from a fast operating system), but I won't be running all proposed commits through a full Plan 9 build. I wanted the try bots to return an answer in a couple minutes. An hour is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nI think there are two meta problems: Plan on GCE has driver bugs, causing it to go really slowly. And Go on Plan 9 is barely functional, with lots of short cuts, skipped tests, and incorrectness (e.g. #9428). Maybe it has performance problems of its own. I don't know.\r\n \r\n",
