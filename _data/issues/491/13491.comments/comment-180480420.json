	"body": "Well, the particular use case I have highlights this fairly well IMO. I have a service which maintains state of downstream services. The list of all downstream services is fluid-- since it is determined by a source of truth service. As such my service has some metrics for each downstream. Since I cannot call \"remove\" i effectively leak N metrics per service that appears and then gets removed, since I cannot remove the metrics associated with that service.\r\n\r\nI don't think adding a `Remove` method immediately constitutes \"breaking monitoring\" as it would still require the developer to actually call `Remove`.
