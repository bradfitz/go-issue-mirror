	"body": "I've been using expvar for a few metrics related cases, and its great. The one thing I really see as missing is that there is no mechanism to remove items from an expvar.Map. I had created a PR with  a simple Remove method which returns the Var associated with key-- or nil. I don't see any reason that it shouldn't-- so I created  a simple patch (#13490) which adds a Remove method to expvar.Map",
