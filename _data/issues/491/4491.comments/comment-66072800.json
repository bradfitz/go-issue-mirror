That\nsaid, one of the last lines printed is: \n1551  11:15:11.836543 --- SIGHUP (Hangup) @ 0 (0) ---\n\nDoes that mean it got a hang-up signal and exited even if it was executed with nohup?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4491/13/trace_obfuscated.log\"\u003etrace_obfuscated.log\u003c/a\u003e (9466838 bytes)",
