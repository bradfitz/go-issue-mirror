Since then, I've been trying to get the changes to\ncompile but whatever I try to add to the M struct produces some output and then fails\n(not exactly a compilation error):\n\n...\npkg/text/template/parse\npkg/text/template\npkg/go/doc\npkg/go/build\ncmd/go\npkg/runtime (linux/amd64)\nsizeofSigset = 8;\naggr Sigset\n{\n\t'a' 0 mask;\n};\n...\n\n I tried to figure this out and it looks like adding something to the struct needs also some changing elsewhere. There a hint in runtime.h but I couldn't actually figure this out on my own:\n// The offsets of these fields are known to (hard-coded in) libmach.\n\nTurns out it's a lot bigger bag of fun than I expected it to be. :)\u003c/pre\u003e",
