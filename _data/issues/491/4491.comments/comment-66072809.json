He suggests it should be\nmoved into mp and kept there for the child to use later on. So, you should add field\n\"Sigset oset\" to struct M (in runtime.h). Then you should delete local oset variable in\nruntime·newosproc and use mp-\u003eoset instead.\n\n2) \"The sigset_none should be whatever signals the parent had ...\"\n\nSo, now that you are in the child (in runtime·minit) replace sigset_none with m-\u003eoset,\nwhich will have preserved signal mask.\n\nI am probably talking rubbish here, but rsc is away for couple of days. And why\nshouldn't you have some fun yourself :-) What is the worst that could happened?\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
