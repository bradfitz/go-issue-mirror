As I was about to run a new test this morning, I just went with Alex's\npatch. Using this, I patched and built go locally and then built my executable using\nthat patched go dist. I'm getting the same results now, unfortunately. It's my first\ntime building with a go dist from source but I think I've done that correctly (I've set\nGOROOT to be the directory with the source and I've added $GOROOT/bin to the path). Go\nversion does seem to confirm I'm good: \ngo version devel +ec1e87068221 Fri Jan 11 08:30:25 2013 -0800 darwin/amd64\n\nI'm attaching the last part of the strace log from that last execution in case someone\nwants to take a look.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4491/30/strace_extract.log\"\u003estrace_extract.log\u003c/a\u003e (1328643 bytes)",
