I'm\ncurrently running this one the same way I was running my original program and I'm doing\nthe strace to get that info if that turns out to effectively reproduce the issue. This\ntest is still not using all features that I was using in the original but that's\nprobably a good first attempt.\n\nFor reference (and so I don't lose it), I started the test with:\nnohup ./pollrunner \u003e run-`date +%F-%H-%M`.log 2\u003e\u00261 \u0026\n\nand the strace with the following:\nnohup strace -v -f -s1000 -tt -otrace.log -p 6834 \u0026\u003c/pre\u003e",
