I wish I woud have been able to go ahead and make changes and\ntest them quickly but there would be a significant overhead for me. \n\nIf anyone with the capacity has a few minutes to spend on this, I could apply the patch\nand test it. I'll be spending the next day or so still testing this program of mine that\nexposed this bug.\u003c/pre\u003e",
