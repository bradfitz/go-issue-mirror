I did see that\nthe box I'm running in on right now has only 375 MB of free physical ram but I was\ninitially running it on another box that has more than 1.7 GB of free physical RAM and I\nhad made the switch to try and see if there was something wrong with the first one. \n\nAlso, wouldn't the memory usage be the same regardless of whether I'm logged in/tailing\nthe output log than if I'm logged out?\n\nThe current status is that this is still occurring as per my initial description. If I\nkill my remote ssh session to the box running it, it eventually disappears but if I'm\nlogged in and tailing the log, it stays there up to the normal program termination.\u003c/pre\u003e",
