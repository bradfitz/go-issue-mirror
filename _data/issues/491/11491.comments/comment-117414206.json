	"body": "Yes, locking\u0026allocating at each map access should work.  I have been worried about the contention for locking, but I guess \u003e1K values aren't that likely.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking there may be a slightly better way.  The original reason for returning the zero value was that the caller didn't need to condition on the return value, it could just unconditionally copy the return value to the destination.  This is good for small values, but for large values the overhead is in the noise, and it actually hurts because we use memmove and not memzero.\r\n\r\nSo maybe we should reintroduce the condition on the return value for maps with values \u003e1K?  We'd have to compare the return value against \u0026zero1024, but that seems like it would be ok.",
