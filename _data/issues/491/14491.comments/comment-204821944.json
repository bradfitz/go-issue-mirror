I'm not asking for you or anybody to agree with me, but at least take a stance for or against.\r\n\r\nI think that is the root of the confusion. Go is from a different style of languages compared to, say, Java, with which perhaps you're more familiar.\r\n\r\nIn Go, a function may not do what it says if it returns an error. Here are 821 functions and methods from the Go standard library which are no different from `ioutil.WriteFile` in that regard: https://gist.github.com/bradfitz/d921c0286a8479d6777d539f953db70d\r\n\r\nAlways check your errors.\r\n",
