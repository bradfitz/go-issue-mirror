If not, it's a problem with the filesystem or kernel or Go runtime. It's not something you can work around by changing which functions you use.\r\n\r\nIf anybody has a reliable repro of this, please file a new bug with details of the operating system, version, filesystem type, and Go code checking all its errors.\r\n",
