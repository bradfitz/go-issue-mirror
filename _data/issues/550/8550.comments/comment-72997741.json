It's because Hong Kong\r\nwas indeed using LMT with GMT offset of 7:36:42 until 1904 Oct 30, at\r\nleast according to the latest tzdata for Asia/Hong_Kong.\r\n\r\nI think this issue is mostly due to the fact that some people are not aware\r\nthat the correct time zone actually depends on the date and it's not\r\nnecessarily the same as the current timezone in use.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue as working as intended.\r\n",
