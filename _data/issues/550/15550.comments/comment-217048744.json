Arguably the Go spec says it should print **3** (not 1, like I say above), because the value of iota is said to reset whenever the `const` keyword appears in the *source*, not in the block.  I suspect that's just because the Go spec's wording wasn't written with nested const declarations in mind.\r\n\r\n2. Should\r\n\r\n        const _ = unsafe.Sizeof(func() int {\r\n            var _ int\r\n            return iota\r\n        })\r\n\r\n    be valid? Arguably `iota` here is appearing inside a ConstSpec so it should be allowed by the spec, yet cmd/compile, gotype, and gccgo all reject it.  (cmd/compile accepts it if you remove the `var` declaration.)\r\n\r\n/cc @griesemer @ianlancetaylor ",
