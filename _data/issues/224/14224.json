	"body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI had some problems on resolving dependencies of my project if `$GOTPATH` is inside my project directory:\r\nProject: /home/user/project/\r\nGOPATH: /home/user/project/go\r\n\r\nI wanted to resolve dependencies with \r\n```bash\r\n$ GOPATH=/home/user/project/go/ go get -v -d ./...\r\n```\r\nbut some errors like \"... cannot find package ...\" appears. If I run rerun this command some times it will work...\r\n\r\nIf I changed `GOPATH` to /tmp/go all is working fine!\r\n\r\nMaybe this is a bug or it is unwanted to place dependencies inside project dir...\r\n\r\n/ARO",
