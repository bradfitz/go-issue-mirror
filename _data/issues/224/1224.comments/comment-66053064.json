I have sent in a CL to address this.\n\nInsertBefore, InsertAfter, MoveToFront, and MoveToBack all require that an element\nalready be in the list to do anything at all, so there's no problem once the bug in\nRemove is fixed.\n\nSonia, I agree *List is a better form of id than *byte, and have made the change in my\nCL. It's not exported, but I don't disagree that it shouldn't be (via a method, List).\n\nAll list operations that can fail do so silently by design.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **packagebug**._\n\n_Owner changed to **a...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Started**._",
