	"body": "Add the capability for the watcher's git archive server to optionally filter out content.\r\n\r\nThen when the coordinator is asking for the \"talks\" repo, it can skip the 30+ MB of binaries.\r\n\r\nWe already do this with the .gitattributes file (see https://golang.org/cl/11050 for #11199) but that's a hack. We should revert that once the coordinator knows how to ask the watcher to filter stuff.\r\n\r\n/cc @adg @minux ",
