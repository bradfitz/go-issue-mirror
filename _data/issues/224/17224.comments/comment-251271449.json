No, I'm not running any virtual machines or similar.\r\nThe tests were started from the script that creates an installation package, but that script is a simple shell-script that creates a pseudo-hierarchy under /tmp (usr, usr/lib and so on) and packages everything then in a gzipped tar archive (.tgz). It doesn't use chroot or something else as far as I can see. You can find the script here: https://slackbuilds.org/slackbuilds/14.2/development/google-go-lang/google-go-lang.SlackBuild\r\nI run it with\r\nRUN_TEST=true sh ./google-go-lang.SlackBuild\r\n\r\nand on one system it fails, on another one not.\r\n\r\nAnd also after installation, I have the test installed under /usr/lib64/go1.7.1/go/src/syscall/exec_linux_test.go and if I run (as root)\r\n```sh\r\n$ echo $GOROOT\r\n/usr/lib64/go1.7.1/go\r\n\r\n$ go test -c syscall\r\n$ ./syscall.test\r\n```\r\nI get the same error",
