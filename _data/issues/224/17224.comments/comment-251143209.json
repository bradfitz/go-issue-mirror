The cat process should be run in a new network namespace that only has an lo interface.\r\n\r\nIs there anything special about your server? I notice that we are already skipping this test on Kubernetes. I would expect if the clone() syscall fails that the test would fail with \"Cmd failed\" and not the error you saw.",
