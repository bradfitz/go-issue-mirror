	"body": "The \"Building compilers and go_bootstrap\" step is compiling packages sequentially (there is parallelism in running the assemblers over the .s files in a package, but packages are build one at a time). This is causing bootstrapping to be slow, especially on machines with large number of cores.\r\n\r\nOn my ARM64, which is an 8-core machine, the cmd/dist step takes *5 times* longer than `go install std cmd`.\r\n",
