Is there any hint in the information provided to narrow down where the search is? Do you have any guesses as to what kind of invalid behavior to look for specifically? I'll look for finalizers on C allocated memory (I believe that's what @rsc meant in his first comment on this issue), but are there any more? I'd be willing to annotate all of our finalizer stuff, but I don't know what I'd annotate.\r\n\r\nI'll begin looking now, regardless, to see if anything obvious sticks out.",
