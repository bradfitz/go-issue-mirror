Or maybe it's not worth it.\r\n\r\nI suppose we could do this reasonably efficiently by first checking the second word of the object. If it's 0xdead... then we also have to scan the span's free list to see if it's really free, but this is quite unlikely. I could spin a patch for @zeebo to try so we can check this theory.\r\n\r\nWith my sweep-free allocation proposal, we would just have to check the span sweep offset and possibly the mark bitmap.",
