	"body": "https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/10953/ added support for converting from the crypto.Signer interface, added in Go 1.4 to an ssh.Signer.\r\n\r\nThis means the crypto package does not compile under Go 1.3 and earlier. This is a problem for Canonical as (for various long, but immutable reasons) we are stuck on Go 1.2 for several of the operating system versions we support.\r\n\r\n@agl one solution to this is to isolate the change to keys.go into a file which is only built with Go 1.4 or later. This would hide this feature from Go versions which do not support crypto.Signer.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to define an interface in the ssh package that is compatible with crypto.Signer, and use that as the formal parameter to those new methods in keys.go\r\n\r\nI think the former is a cleaner option. What do you think ?",
