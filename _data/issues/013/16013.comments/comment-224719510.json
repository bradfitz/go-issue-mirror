We need a BP if you want to see who's calling duffcopy/duffzero.\r\n\r\nFor leaf routines, I thought it was just functions with a zero-sized frame that didn't do BP adjustment, which is a subset of leaf functions, but not all of them. I consider not doing BP adjustment for these a bug. It's just an unfortunate consequence of our rule to avoid adding BPs to sensitive assembly functions. But for these we still *could* do BP adjustment in the function prologue, but we really can't do BP adjustment in duffcopy/duffzero.",
