Perhaps we should roll back, but also consider\nthat code that depends on the behavior of a stream of random numbers is poorly designed.\nI consider Seed(0) to be useful for checking between runs, but would never expect it to\nguarantee the numbers in perpetuity. It's not documented that it can change, but it's\narguably reasonable for it to do so.\u003c/pre\u003e",
