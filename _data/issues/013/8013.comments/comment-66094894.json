I propose to do that for Go 1.3. That sidesteps the\nissue of whether we could change the results, although we may want to decide and write\nsomething anyway.\n\nI also note that example_test.go says:\n\n// These tests serve as an example but also make sure we don't change\n// the output of the random number generator when given a fixed seed.\n\nSadly, no one paid attention to that: the CL that changed the results just changed the\nexample.\u003c/pre\u003e",
