I can see arguments either way.\n\nBut I'm not really on the fence about rand.New(mySource).  The whole point of the Source\ninterface is that you get the same sequence of random numbers.  I think we would need a\ngood reason to change that, like, fixing a bug.  I don't think that performance\nimprovement is a good enough reason.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**._",
