I was wrong about the Intn/Int31n/Int64n results changing: I\nmisread the general case as being too conservative when in fact it is exactly right. The\nperformance improvement there is really just replacing a % with an \u0026. It does not change\nthe number of values read from the source, nor does it change the output.\n\nOnly Float32 and Float64 are changing their results. I suspect we can fix the bug there\nwithout changing the results in practice, since the bug only happened in about 1 in 2^24\nor 1 in 2^53 results. But if we do this we should decide that we're committed to not\nchanging results in general for compatibility (excluding bug fixes).\u003c/pre\u003e",
