	"body": "@jacobsa, the use cases this was originally designed for was calling `Transport.CancelRequest` after `Transport.RoundTrip` has returned (and then you know it's in the in-flight map).  See #3672 for history.\r\n\r\nAnd for those concerned about `Transport.RoundTrip` taking too long to return the headers can use `Transport.ResponseHeaderTimeout`. History is in #3362.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to know what phase of its lifecycle a Transport's `*Request` is in, perhaps that ties into #9194\r\n\r\nIn addition to lack of contexts, it's also unfortunate that `CancelRequest` doesn't return a value too.\r\n\r\nBut unless there's something concrete to do here, I'm tempted to close this bug. So please propose something if you have an idea.\r\n\r\nMaybe Transport could keep track of the set of requests which have been canceled but not yet started (and then fail the request if it does come in later), and start a timer to remove that map entry in _N_ seconds? But what is _N_?",
