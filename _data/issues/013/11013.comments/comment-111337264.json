	"body": "I think `\u003c-chan struct{}` would be better, yeah.\r\n\r\nRegarding `Transport.CancelRequest`: I think you could actually leave this as-is, documenting its downsides and maybe marking it as deprecated, but have *it* continue to do the heavy lifting of cancellation. That is:\r\n\r\n* RoundTrip inserts into the map then tells the cancellation goroutine about the channel.\r\n* The cancellation goroutine calls `CancelRequest` when one of the channels it knows about is closed.\r\n\r\nOdd to be using the deprecated API to implement the new one internally, but it's safe because you can synchronize on the insert into the map. Put another way: if the old API weren't already promised, it could just be an implementation detail.",
