You wouldn't want multiple goroutines calling close on it. One might panic then.\r\n\r\nWhat about `Transport.CancelRequest`? It would reasonably want to cancel it also. Maybe? I suppose we don't want to allocate the channel by default (and `Transport.CancelRequest` can't assume it's already there, nor set it from another goroutine), so I `CancelRequest` will have to forever use its existing mechanism. That leads me to say (a), which is also the type returned by `Context.Done` in http://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/context#Context\r\n\r\n\r\n",
