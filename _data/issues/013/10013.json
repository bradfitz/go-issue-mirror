If the ticker was set to delay until 2014 or 2016, it waited (as expected).\r\nWhat was expected: If the ticker was set to delay until 2015, it should have waited, just as it did for 2014 or 2016.\r\n\r\nTo see the 2015 example which incorrectly returns immediately, please see here: http://play.golang.org/p/31OF29CrAp\r\n\r\nTo see the 2014 and 2016 examples, respectively, please see here http://play.golang.org/p/xEXr5CODE8 or here http://play.golang.org/p/Lxk9ivcB_q\r\n\r\nI have not been able to reproduce this locally, so it seems to be an issue with the playground code (perhaps the Javascript?) rather than with go itself.",
