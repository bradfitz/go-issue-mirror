	"body": "If you pass `math.Float64frombits(uint64(2))` to `math.Sqrt` on a machine that uses the software version (such as ppc64x https://golang.org/src/math/stubs_ppc64x.s#L87) it will end up in an infinite loop here https://golang.org/src/math/sqrt.go#L110\r\n\r\nUnfortunatelly i don't have a ppc64x machine nearby. So I can't test this properly, however I did copy the library and manually call `math.sqrt` (the unexported, pure go version) with the argument and I have reproduced the problem.",
