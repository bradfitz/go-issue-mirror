My guess is it's \"documented\" in the source code for the dynamic linker.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure I'd have changed the title, since the issue was specifically about the last program header being bad (unless you think the alignment is the cause of the malformed final header), e.g.:\r\n\r\n`0x65041580 off    0x0000000000000000 vaddr 0x0000000000000000 paddr 0x0000000000000000 align 2**3 filesz 0x0000000000000000 memsz 0x0000000000000000 flags --- 2a00`\r\n\r\nis not a valid header; not only is the program header name unknown, it's flags are nill, and it has '2a00' after flags, which is probably an artifact of `objdump` not understanding the ph.\r\n",
