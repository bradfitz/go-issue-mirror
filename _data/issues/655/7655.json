	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhen a function, no matter how simple, contains and uses a const declaration it is not\ninline-able: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/gXJopk4eC-\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/gXJopk4eC-\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe difference between the two functions is that one uses a variable, and the other a\nconst declaration, yet the former can be inlined, the latter is not. This can be seen\nwhen compiling with \u0026quot;-gcflags -m\u0026quot;.\n\nTested on darwin/amd64 at tip.\u003c/pre\u003e",
