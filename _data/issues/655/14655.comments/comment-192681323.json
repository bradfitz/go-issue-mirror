I'd prefer to just do a bunch of little conversions from little byte slices to little strings.\r\n\r\n(In the future, it might be nice to not even allocate for the common map keys, since most http.Handlers receiving POSTs will be getting the same map keys repeatedly. But there's no great place to stash that cache, since we don't know which handler the request is for (yet). We might know that later, if #14660 happens, since we could associate a Handler with a Request via context keys... but that's just thinking ahead and not needed for addressing this garbage)",
