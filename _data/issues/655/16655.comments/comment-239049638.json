It cannot be too complicated.\r\n\r\n\u003e It provide a alternative package “gopkg.in/natefinch/npipe.v2”。 but it is unstable and low performance.\r\n\r\nYou have source code for it. You can fix it. Or write your own. Or use Microsoft's implementation as suggested by @pi. (I never looked at either library, and I wouldn't know how good / bad they are).\r\n\r\nAlex",
