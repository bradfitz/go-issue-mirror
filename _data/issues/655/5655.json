This is unfortunate,\nbecause if I have a directory full of *.go files making up a package, having the tests\nin _test.go would be set apart visually in the directory listing.\n\nI think the documentation is correct and the \u0026quot;testing\u0026quot; package is wrong.\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version') Observed in both \u0026quot;go1.0.3\n(appengine-1.8.0)\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;version go1.1 darwin/amd64\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e",
