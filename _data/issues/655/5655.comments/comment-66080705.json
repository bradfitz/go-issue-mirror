Well, the filename _test.go also ends with “_test.go”, so this\nfix is a no-op.\n\nIf you’re determined to just change the documentation you have to sa y “ends with\n_test.go but with one or more characters preceding the _”  Which, if I were writing\nit, would make me ask “why does this artificial restriction exist?”\u003c/pre\u003e",
