	"body": "When calling `git-codereview hooks`, it shouldn't skip over hook files that already exist.\r\n\r\nMy GOROOT had the default Gerrit hooks instead of git-codereview's hooks.\r\n\r\ninstallHook probably needs a flag to skip this block of code:\r\n```\r\n\t\t// If hook file exists, assume it is okay.\r\n\t\t_, err := os.Stat(filename)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, we could use file size as a heuristic to re-install the hooks, since we're already statting the file.",
