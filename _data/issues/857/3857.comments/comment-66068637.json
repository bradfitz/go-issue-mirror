If you have something useful to say,\nyou're welcome to participate in the project.\n\nFeel free to share your Python, Ruby, Java, and JavaScript implementations, for instance.\n\nThe current thinking on this bug is that we won't grab a mutex and deadlock like now,\nbut the database/sql will keep its promise to drivers and not used a driver.Conn\nconcurrently unless the driver opts-in to it.  Regardless of the driver's choice, the\n*sql.Tx may also be used concurrently, but the sql package may serialize queries for\ndrivers onto the same Conn if no alternative is provided by the driver.  (The driver\ncould choose to allow concurrent use of the same Conn, or even spread a transaction out\nover multiple Conns)\u003c/pre\u003e",
