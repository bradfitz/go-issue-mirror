The Ruby version has too many files and\nrequires too much fluff (ActiveRecord, ActiveSupport, etc.), as does the Python version\n(SQLAlchemy, etc.), so I left those out.  The Java version is straight JDBC with the\nPostgreSQL driver.  The JavaScript version uses any-db and pg.\n\nI also attached the Go version.  It doesn't work (hangs almost immediately), but maybe\nit can serve as a reference.  Like I said, I'm new to Go, so apologies if my coding\nstyle isn't up to snuff there.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3857/19/MigrateNoaa.java\"\u003eMigrateNoaa.java\u003c/a\u003e (1688 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3857/19/migrate_noaa.js\"\u003emigrate_noaa.js\u003c/a\u003e (1397 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3857/19/noaa.go\"\u003enoaa.go\u003c/a\u003e (2861 bytes)",
