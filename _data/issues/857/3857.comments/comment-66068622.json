You're proposing ditching that promise and pushing\ncomplexity down to the drivers.\n\nYour example code works if you close the first query before doing the second query in\nthe transaction.\n\nDoes SQLite even support concurrent queries within a transaction?  It doesn't even\nsupport concurrent queries at all, really.\n\nI'm fine making this work concurrently if a driver opts-in and says they support it, but\nit can't work with the current sql/driver promise.\n\nI'm sorry you don't like the sql package.  You can use databases directly if you don't\nlike the existing abstractions.  It's a trade-off between flexibility \u0026 pain vs\nsimplicity \u0026 easy.\u003c/pre\u003e",
