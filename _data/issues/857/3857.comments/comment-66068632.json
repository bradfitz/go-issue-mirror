Within a single\ntransaction I believe that it is plausible for a database to require\nsequential use of queries. If some databases deadlock when you try to\nrun a second query in a transaction without consuming the results of\nthe first, then database/sql should detect this case and give a nice\nerror instead of letting things deadlock. That's all I'm saying. I'm\nnot trying to artificially limit what the package can do, just to give\na better error if indeed the database cannot handle what is being\nasked.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
