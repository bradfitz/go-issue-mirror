	"body": "It should be easy to show the panics in the traceback. In fact, you will see them if you run with GOTRACEBACK=system. They just don't show by default because \"panic\" doesn't actually exist and the runtime function that implements it gets elided because it's a runtime function. We could just special case traceback to show the runtime.gopanic frame and probably rewrite it to \"runtime.panic\" (or maybe even \"panic\") to make it really clear.\r\n\r\nGiving more information about what frames belong to the defer and where that defer came from is a bit trickier, but I think still doable. The defer is still on the G's defer list while it's running, so most of the information is there, including the exact PC where the defer was created. We might have to record not just that the defer has started, but what SP it's running at to give traceback enough bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n/cc @randall77 for any thoughts.",
