But I think correct input character decoding is more important than ctrl+Z handling.\r\n\r\n\u003e @alexbrainman Yes, with this change it works.\r\n\r\nThanks for checking.\r\n\r\nI will let my https://go-review.googlesource.com/27576 as alternative to @mattn change. Given that I was against submitting of CL 4310 in the first place (and I didn't changed my mind), I don't see how I can make correct call here. So leaving for someone else to decide which CL to go with. Plus I know very little about Unicode.\r\n\r\nAlex",
