On the\nclient side, it seems that the only signal it touches is SIGPIPE. It has code:\n\n  #if HAVE_DECL_MSG_NOSIGNAL\n  static dbus_bool_t _dbus_modify_sigpipe = FALSE;\n  #else\n  static dbus_bool_t _dbus_modify_sigpipe = TRUE;\n  #endif\n\nAnd then on connection opening it does:\n\n  if (_dbus_modify_sigpipe)\n    _dbus_disable_sigpipe ();\n\nWhich in turn results in a function call (if true):\n\n  void _dbus_disable_sigpipe (void)\n  {\n    signal (SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN);\n  }\n\nOn my machine I know it doesn't run _dbus_disable_sigpipe, maybe that's the issue.\nHonestly I'm not an expert on how signals work in linux.\u003c/pre\u003e",
