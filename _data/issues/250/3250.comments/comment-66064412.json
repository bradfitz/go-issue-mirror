We like our signal handlers,\nbut they can't cope with being invoked on non-Go threads.\nWe could ignore such signals easily enough, but perhaps\ngtk is really trying to handle that signal (or maybe it's a SIGSEGV\nor something).\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-go1**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to **builder@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
