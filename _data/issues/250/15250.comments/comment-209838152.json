	"body": "Thanks that's very interesting.\r\n\r\nI wrongly assumed that shutdown was working with unxigrams but after having a look at the doc of `shutdown`, I see that it only mentions full-duplex connections. So using it on unixgram sockets is an unspecified behavior.\r\nI was relying on an unspecified behavior and should have been using \"unix\" or \"unixpacket\" instead.\r\n\r\nI think it is a very bad idea to try to unify an unspecified behavior on multiple platforms.  So I am closing this issue. Thanks for your patience!",
