I have no idea whether a git clean (removing untracked files, i.e. compile output and generated files) has any effect in any of this, but better be safe than sorry.\r\n\r\nI didn't know alignment issues like these could have such a big change in performance, but what you explain makes sense. Thanks for the thorough explanation.\r\n\r\n\u003e I was able to build two go1 benchmark binaries at ec9c84c where one of them was significantly slower than the build at 196df6f, while the other performed identically.\r\n\r\nJust to be sure I understand; This means that if I do my process enough times, I should get the 3/4% slowdown sometimes, and no slowdown at all some other times? I'm not sure I understand what you mean by incremental builds, but I think I'm not doing that precisely because of the `git clean` before each build.",
