	"body": "\u003e What I don't understand is how you managed to get two test binaries, one that showed the slowdown and one that didn't - presumably because the alignment was different in each.\r\n\r\nThis was entirely accidental. In principle, the incremental build should produce the same binary as the full build given the same source tree. I don't know why it doesn't, and this is probably a (minor) bug in the compiler, but I just took advantage of it when I noticed. :)\r\n\r\n\u003e Is there a doc that outlines the workflow when working with tip? I have no idea if full builds are even necessary after pulling a bunch of commits on tip, versus something like go install std.\r\n\r\nYou should always do a full `make.bash` after pulling. If you're just modifying something in the standard library (including the runtime), you should be able to just use `go install`, since it will rebuild standard library packages if necessary. If you're modifying the compiler, things get hairier, but you generally want a `make.bash`.",
