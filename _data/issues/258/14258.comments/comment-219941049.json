Not sure if Nigel agrees through.\r\n* Re-balance. If lazy is made capable of 3 byte matches, that will be even more relevant, and \"lazy\" belongs to level 7-9 or thereabout.\r\n* The token storage can be made to avoid bounds checks. This is trivial and can be quite nicely implmented, but I couldn't make the 1.7 deadline.\r\n\r\n\u003eI don't think there are any open CLs. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nCorrect, AFAIK.",
