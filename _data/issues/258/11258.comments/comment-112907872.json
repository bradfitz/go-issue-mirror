Probably just before the -pthread option.\r\n\r\nI took those options from the # cgo LDFLAGS line in crypto/x509/root_cgo_darwin.go.  I don't see a way for us to add those lines to the final command line, as that is not under our control.  I don't know if there is a way to avoid needing them at all.
