	"body": "by **marko@trustly.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eHi,\n\nThis simple program doesn't trigger shadowing warnings from go vet:\n\npackage main\n\nfunc f() (string, error) {\n\treturn \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot;, nil\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar c int\n\tvar b int\n\tif true {\n\t\tc, _ := f()\n\t\t_ = c\n\t\tvar b string\n\t\t_ = b\n\t}\n\t_ = c\n\t_ = b\n}\n\nHowever, I think it would be useful to complain about the variable  c  shadowing the\nprevious declaration; the fact that they are of different types isn't obvious when using\n:=.  Attached is a patch to do that.  After applying, vet complains about  c, but not  b.\n\nAny thoughts?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/7258/0/shadow.patch\"\u003eshadow.patch\u003c/a\u003e (1449 bytes)",
