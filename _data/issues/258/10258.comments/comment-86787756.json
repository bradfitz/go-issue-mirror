Some signature hash of those things would be stored. That manifest file would be shipped with the compiler and it would say that the runtime lib has been compiled with a certain compiler.\n\u003e \n\u003e If you use a different compiler then that manifest would be invalid because it includes what compiler is used and the files would be recompiled.\n\u003e \n\u003e You could tell the compiler to ignore that file like make -b and it would recompile the objects, otherwise it would reuse the object files if it noticed that compiler to the source changed.\n\u003e \n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n\u003e \n",
