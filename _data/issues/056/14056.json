	"body": "This is my first experience with Go, and so I'm hoping that this is the right place to report this issue.  I can reproduce it reliably on my system.\r\n\r\nAny Go program I compile opens the Windows Mouse control panel when I open it from the bin directory in PowerShell.   The problem doesn't occur in ```cmd``` or if I run ```bin\\main``` from PowerShell.  This occurs on both 1.5.2 and 1.5.3 windows/amd64 official builds -- I am on Windows 10 x64 10.0.10586.\r\n\r\nHere is a GIF of me reproducing the problem:\r\n![animation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/644072/12483316/400bcec6-c022-11e5-8642-ec8436ff8833.gif)\r\n\r\nI'm happy to provide any additional information!",
