So we will unnecessary limit it for\nlarge programs running on large boxes; and at the same time allow a \"hello world\"\nprogram to create 1000 threads when it needs only 1.\nUsers must limit number of threads in sys/cgo calls. If that's implemented poorly in net\npackage than that needs to be addressed (most likely we do not want 1000 threads\nresolving DNS).\nWe can also throttle thread creation in runtime after some threshold.\nBut hard limit is a time bomb.\u003c/pre\u003e",
