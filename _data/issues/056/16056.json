This was probably the fault of commit 1ded9fd: \"syscall: fix unshare test on mips\", though maybe that just exposed an existing bug.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ greplogs -dashboard -l -E '/bin/cat: invalid' | findflakes -dir ~/.cache/fetchlogs/rev -paths\r\nFirst observed be1b930 20 May 14:36 2016 (202 commits ago)\r\nLast observed  5701174 13 Jun 14:05 2016 (0 commits ago)\r\n100% chance failure is still happening\r\n22% failure probability (45 of 203 commits)\r\nLikely culprits:\r\n   22% be1b930 reflect: hide unexported methods that do not satisfy interfaces\r\n   17% b3bf2e7 net/http: update bundled http2\r\n   13% 1ded9fd syscall: fix unshare test on mips\r\n   10% 16f846a net/http: update bundled http2\r\n    8% 9cd2c70 net: deflake TestDialTimeoutMaxDuration\r\n    6% 8527b8e syscall: add Unshare flags to SysProcAttr on Linux\r\n    5% 448246a cmd/compile: don't exit early because of hidden error messages\r\n    4% dc4427f context: make DeadlineExceeded have a Timeout method\r\n    3% 0b80659 net/http/httptest: restore historic ResponseRecorder.HeaderMap behavior\r\n    2% 3b50adb build: unset GOBIN during build\r\nNo known past failures\r\n```\r\n\r\n/cc @cherrymui @jfrazelle ",
