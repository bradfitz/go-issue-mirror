	"body": "I have a minor concern with simply hiding deprecated items. If I'm reviewing some code that uses a deprecated feature that I'm unfamiliar with and then go to the godoc of the package, I'll be a little confused when cntrl-f doesn't show the deprecated feature in question. Remembering to show deprecated features is probably not my first thought. Is it possible for cntrl-f to search through (and show) javascript hidden elements?\r\n\r\nHowever, I strongly believe that we should display deprecated features differently somehow in godoc.\r\n\r\nEdit: Just a thought, maybe hide deprecated types, methods, and functions from the index? but still show them in package documentation? It's inconsistent, so I'm on the fence about this idea.",
