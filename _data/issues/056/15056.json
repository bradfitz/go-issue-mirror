	"body": "The wiki page _WindowsCrossCompiling_ needs to be updated to reflect the current status of cross compiling for Windows. The process has gotten much easier since version 1.5.\r\n\r\nPage: \r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WindowsCrossCompiling\r\n\r\nI've upated the page to refer to both versions. Please let me know here if you are not happy with this change. I would actually suggest deleting the pre1.5 part of the page.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo 1.6 (`go version go1.6 darwin/amd64`)\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\"A browser\"\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI think the page could be replaced more or less with a single line of \r\n\r\n    GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build hello.go\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nA long-winded page on building go etc.\r\n",
