	"title": "proposal: more functional programming support in standard library",
	"body": "Hello everyone, recently I have written some functional-style code, and found that although function is the first class in Golang, there isn't any other functional programming support like common high level function(map, reduce, partial etc.) in Golang. Why don't we add a package in standard library just like functools in python?\r\n\r\nI have already written a simple prototype [gofunctools](https://github.com/choleraehyq/gofunctools) to show my idea.",
