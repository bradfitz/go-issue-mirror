LDFLAGS may contain more than just an enumeration of libraries, it may also contain behaviour-modifying linker flags; if I'm the author of p1 but not p2, and I need to pass some linker flag (for p1) that conflicts with some flag the author of p2 is passing, I'm stuck. In other words, it's not the case that all linker flags are agglomerated by the transitive property.",
