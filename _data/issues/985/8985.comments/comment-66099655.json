(A method\nthat is not used does increase it in some cases.)\n\nPeople using a package need to be able to understand and use all the functions in the\npackage.  When considering whether to add a new function, we need to consider not only\nwhether the function is handy, but also how much extra cognitive load it imposes on\nevery user of the package.  Adding a bunch of trivial but handy functions is not free;\nit means that every user of the package needs to know about those functions and\nunderstand what they do.  In many cases we prefer to lean in the direction of providing\nthe minimum set of functions required so that you can do whatever you need.  A minimum\nset of functions can be fully understood.\u003c/pre\u003e",
