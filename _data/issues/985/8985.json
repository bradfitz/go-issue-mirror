	"body": "by **cserveny.tamas**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat does 'go version' print?\ngo version go1.3 linux/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/wyXd227u7F\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/wyXd227u7F\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat happened?\n\nParseIP tries to parse it as an IPv4 address, but fails. Apparently IPv6 parser accepts\nIPv4 addresses and formats them accordingly, but there is no way to determine whether\nthe IP is 4 or 6 this way.\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nI would have expected len = 4. The intent of the code was clearly this.\nTest case ip_test.go is broken , because IPv4 equals the correct IPv6 notation so the\nautomated tests did not catch this.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nIt would be good to be able to determine the type of address with len, better even if go\nwould provide IsIPv4 method.\u003c/pre\u003e",
