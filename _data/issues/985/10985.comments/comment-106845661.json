Without reflect, it seems that preallocation saves about a factor of 2.  With reflect it saves only about 20%.  Reflect is pretty slow already, I'm not entirely convinced that this is worth the API surface.\r\n\r\nThat said, it is an easy modification.\r\n\r\nBenchmarkRawMap        \t     200\t   8782041 ns/op\r\nBenchmarkRawMapSize    \t     300\t   4168970 ns/op\r\nBenchmarkReflectMap    \t     100\t  24216280 ns/op\r\nBenchmarkReflectMapSize\t     100\t  19667848 ns/op\r\n\r\ncode here: https://go-review.googlesource.com/10510",
