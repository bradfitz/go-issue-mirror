The code already works as documented. Also this won't work for HTTP 2 anyway as it's implemented in the golang.org/x/net/http2 repo which is vendored into the net/http package.\r\n\r\nThe comment on Request.Proto should probably be updated to say that HTTP/2.0 will be used for client requests if available.",
