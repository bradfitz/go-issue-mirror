This could require an asset at 1024x1024 and scale.\r\n\r\nAs an addition to this, it may be reasonable to allow someone to tweak how scaling is done with a name modifier, e.g. `assets/icon_bilinear.png` or `assets/icon_lanczos3.png`. Sometimes a different algorithm is enough to produce suitable results.\r\n\r\nWith regards to platform specifics, things may get a little crazy when trying to remain platform agnostic. For example, Android defines the mipmap resource directory specifically for defining icons where assets provided may be displayed larger than what is normally provided in a drawable qualifier (mdpi, hdpi, etc) for cases where something like a home screen may display icons larger than what was intended by the system.\r\n\r\nWith things like this in mind, I don't think it would be unreasonable to allow finite control over defining icon resources to assure the app is presentable for it's intended audience, but this does push against the grain of platform agnostic behavior with gomobile.\r\n\r\nWith regards to Android, I'm unaware if simply packing the icons in the apk is enough (that'd be great). I suspect that a resources.arsc will need to be generated to identify the drawables for their intended configurations, such as with internal/binres.",
