It only talks about the QUERY_STRING and doesn't mention\nthe body at all. There is no RFC talking about this as interpretation of the query\nstring and request body are application defined.\n\nPractical question for merging is what has higher precedence. \n\nThe naming as FormValue would be misleading at best. HTML forms never alter the query\nstring for method=POST. All I read in RFC 3875 is that both should be provided. For a\nmore advanced framework, that implies both should be decoded. I don't see a\njustification for merging them though.\u003c/pre\u003e",
