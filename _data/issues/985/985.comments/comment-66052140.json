Good reasons exist for that like\ndebugging. Some web frameworks provide a merged view, some don't. I don't buy the\nsimplicity argument, but I can see where the desire comes from.\n\nIs the best approach therefore to provide two maps, one for the query parameters and one\nfor the (potential) POST parameters? The merged view can be implemented on top and if\ncode wants to distinguish between the two sets, that possible as well.\u003c/pre\u003e",
