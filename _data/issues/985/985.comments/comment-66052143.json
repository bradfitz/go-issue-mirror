POST data is much\nless visible as it is not shown in the web browser, it normally doesn't end up in server\nlog files etc. For URI parameters you normally get a length limit for free, which could\nbe by-passed if both are parsed and method=GET is not checked.\n\nDistinguishing them can help modularity by separating naturally the parameters that form\nthe current address and the parameters that describe the current action. Something like\nthe \"starring\" of a ticket could be implemented by iterating over the POST keys, match\nthem against a list of known buttons and executing a handler. The action of the forms\nwould simply be the current raw URL.\u003c/pre\u003e",
