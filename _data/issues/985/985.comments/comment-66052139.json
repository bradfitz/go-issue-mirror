I don't buy the \"you'll\nforget to check\" argument about GET vs POST.  In plenty of cases\nyou'd be happy to accept parameters via either method and don't care,\nand it would be extra effort to implement that.  People launching\nmissiles should definitely take the extra time to check req.Method,\nregardless of the form parameters.\n\nGary Burd's comment lists other popular web frameworks that\nmerge the two, suggesting that it's fine to do so in the real world.\n\nThis has the potential to devolve into quite a bikeshed discussion.\nI'm happy to listen to other (non-GET vs POST) arguments though.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
