Usually, setting some environment variables with correct paths\nto toolchain, compiler/linker flags, include \u0026 lib dirs, etc is enough in case of\ntraditional GNU toolchain. There may be go-specific pitfalls, but fixing and/or\ndocumenting them is just a question of time. IMHO, this discussion goes beyond the issue\ntracker format.\u003c/pre\u003e",
