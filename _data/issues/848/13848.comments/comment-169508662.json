I think we're stuck with the implicit guarantee that 1 WriteString call means 1 Write call.\r\n\r\nWhere did this implicit guarantee come from?\r\n\r\nThe documentation for WriteString is:\r\n```go\r\n// WriteString writes the contents of the string s to w, which accepts a slice of bytes.\r\n// If w implements a WriteString method, it is invoked directly.\r\n```\r\nIf this guarantee does exist, it seems important enough that it should be documented.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nAlso, wouldn't a user just do ```w.Write([]byte(s))``` directly if they depended on that behavior?",
