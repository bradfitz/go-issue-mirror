To do that you have to add a prototype\n(without a function body) in a .go file.\n\nI would imagine you need to define NewCallbackCDecl in syscall/syscall_windows.go next\nto NewCallback.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **go1.2**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
