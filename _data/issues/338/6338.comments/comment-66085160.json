I think the fact that it is\nused by some products -  \"... (The dlls GObject and Gtk can be found in any windows\nsystem set up to use pprof with dot/Graphviz) ...\" (as per\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/6338?c=11)\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/6338?c=11)\u003c/a\u003e, means we should export it for\nuse. I will try to use some of kin.wilson.za code to build a test for NewCallbackCDecl,\nso we don't break it in the future.\n\n\u003e ... if we're not going to export\n\u003e NewCallbackCDecl we should delete the new code. if it can't be called, why\n\u003e do we have it?\n\nLooks like hector created the code \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/4058046\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/4058046\u003c/a\u003e. And then\nwebmaster asked me to \"export\" the function \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/4969047\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/4969047\u003c/a\u003e. Goes\nto show how much he used it, as it still doesn't work. As to the code itself, I don't\nthink, there is much there to \"remove\" - callback code is pretty general now.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
