	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eSome vet checks could be short-circuited at the file level. For example, the unsafe\npointer checker could avoid running if unsafe has not been imported. Something similar\nholds for the atomic check, the cyclic finalizer test, and the template check (if it\ngoes in). The asm check could probably be run only on .s files.\u003c/pre\u003e",
