When does this come up? \"If you are reading a JSON array where the elements don't all have the same fields...\" but that doesn't sound like an array to me. Does anything in common use do this? We tend not to extend the standard library for hypotheticals.\r\n\r\nNote also that you can already make a []map[string]interface{} and do this yourself. You can also use a []json.RawMessage and then process each array entry separately, as makes sense.\r\n",
