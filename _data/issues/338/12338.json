	"body": "I am migrating from Go 1.4 to Go 1.5.  When I build my app, the compiler emits a warning that my -ldflags syntax is likely to be deprecated, and offers a misleading suggestion to correct the warning.  My use case is a -X -ldflags value that contains spaces.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go build -ldflags \"-X main.buildInfo 'Version: 2.9, commitID: 4d203fa, build date: Tue Aug 25 19:54:19 PDT 2015, SDK: go version go1.5 darwin/amd64'\" -o stashkins-darwin-amd64\r\n# github.com/xoom/stashkins\r\nlink: warning: option -X main.buildInfo Version: 2.9, commitID: 4d203fa, build date: Tue Aug 25 19:54:19 PDT 2015, SDK: go version go1.5 darwin/amd64 may not work in future releases; use -X main.buildInfo=Version: 2.9, commitID: 4d203fa, build date: Tue Aug 25 19:54:19 PDT 2015, SDK: go version go1.5 darwin/amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I take a variant of the warning advice, I get\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go build -ldflags -X main.buildInfo='Version: 2.9, commitID: 4d203fa, build date: Tue Aug 25 19:54:19 PDT 2015, SDK: go version go1.5 darwin/amd64' -o stashkins-darwin-amd64\r\ncan't load package: package main.buildInfo=Version: 2.9, commitID: 4d203fa, build date: Tue Aug 25 19:54:19 PDT 2015, SDK: go version go1.5 darwin/amd64: cannot find package \"main.buildInfo=Version: 2.9, commitID: 4d203fa, build date: Tue Aug 25 19:54:19 PDT 2015, SDK: go version go1.5 darwin/amd64\" in any of:\r\n\t/usr/local/go/src/main.buildInfo=Version: 2.9, commitID: 4d203fa, build date: Tue Aug 25 19:54:19 PDT 2015, SDK: go version go1.5 darwin/amd64 (from $GOROOT)\r\n\t/Users/mpetrovic/Projects/go/src/main.buildInfo=Version: 2.9, commitID: 4d203fa, build date: Tue Aug 25 19:54:19 PDT 2015, SDK: go version go1.5 darwin/amd64 (from $GOPATH)\r\ncan't load package: package -o: cannot find package \"-o\" in any of:\r\n\t/usr/local/go/src/-o (from $GOROOT)\r\n\t/Users/mpetrovic/Projects/go/src/-o (from $GOPATH)\r\ncan't load package: package stashkins-darwin-amd64: cannot find package \"stashkins-darwin-amd64\" in any of:\r\n\t/usr/local/go/src/stashkins-darwin-amd64 (from $GOROOT)\r\n\t/Users/mpetrovic/Projects/go/src/stashkins-darwin-amd64 (from $GOPATH)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFiddling around with the quotes, I find this invocation works, which the warning did not help me arrive at:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go build -ldflags '-X \"main.buildInfo=Version: 2.9, commitID: a03e9a7, build date: Tue Aug 25 20:51:38 PDT 2015, SDK: go version go1.5 darwin/amd64\"' -o stashkins-darwin-amd64\r\n```",
