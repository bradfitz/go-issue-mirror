But now it sounds like you want to compile the gc cmd/go code with the gccgo go/build package.  That isn't going to work, and making that work doesn't seem like a useful exercise.  If that is a necessary step for using gccgo as the bootstrap compiler for a gc build, then can you walk through the high-level steps that get us to that point?  Thanks.",
