	"body": "Hi there, these are good points, will have to think about that. Right now this is my GO learning project and I intend to continue working on it as i have time. I have been working on patches to the build.go to emit Makefiles and I hope to find other interesting usages of the core code. If I find a roadblock that requires gc of course I can use it for that specific case or rewrite the code. Once I have had my learning time I will be able to make better contributions. I would really like to learn more about how to improve the gcc, and I hope I will be able to do that. ",
