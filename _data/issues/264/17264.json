However, when I try to do this in my ddg project https://github.com/mcandre/mcandre/tree/master/go/ddg, neither `go get` nor `go build` work.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nI expect the `go get` and `go build` commands to work for ddg, as they do for go-ios7crypt.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n* `go get` silently fails.\r\n* `go build` complains that it fails to find the vendored dependencies.",
