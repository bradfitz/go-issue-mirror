So generally things will Just Work.\n\nOnly if tls.Client is used directly and no hostname is given can there be a problem.\nObviously, if a hostname isn't given anywhere then there's nothing that *can* be matched\nagainst and the user of low-level interfaces like that has to take care of it.\n\nPerhaps it should have been a fatal error, but I don't believe that we can break\nbackwards compatibility. There would also then be the question of how to support code\nthat does want to do the checking itself (i.e. because it wants to match iOS which I\nstill believe has non-standard wildcard support.)\n\nSo I think this is WaI. tls.Dial should do what you want without surprises.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
