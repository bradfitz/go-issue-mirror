	"body": "I ran into what I believe is this same problem when attempting to parse certificates generated by [PKI.js](https://github.com/GlobalSign/PKI.js/), which packs multiple attributes into a single ASN.1 SET. [I raised it as an issue over there](https://github.com/GlobalSign/PKI.js/issues/46) and was told by the author of that library that the problem is on the Go side. I can confirm that PKI.js's certificates do parse properly by OpenSSL, in that all attributes in a set are read.\r\n\r\nI believe (at least for my situation) the fix would not require relaxing the constraint that `each common identifier OID is allowed a single value`. Rather, instead of FillFromRDNSequence reading only `rdn[0]`, have an inner loop across all values of `rdn` that does exactly what the single pass does now. You wouldn't have to worry about collisions of multiple values for the same OID any more than you do now, and we would gain the ability to properly parse SETs that contain more than one distinct attribute.",
