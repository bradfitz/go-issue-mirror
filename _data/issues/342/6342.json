	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThis issue is about out-of-the-box support for Android apps in Go.\n\nGo already supports running Go programs on Android devices, however, this does not\nextend to running Go programs through Android apps. Android constrains non-java programs\nto interfacing with Dalvik through the NDK, which effectively forces Go to output shared\nlibraries (.so) files, externally linked with the NDK supplied toolchain.\n\nA prototype of Go NDK support in the form of patches to the runtime is available here:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/eliasnaur/goandroid\"\u003ehttps://github.com/eliasnaur/goandroid\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThis issue does not necessarily require a solution to the much more general problem of\nshared library support, covered by issue #256 and others. A way to limit the scope is to\nintroduce android/arm GOOS/GOARCH combination, which targets the Android bionic runtime\nand make sure that object files suitable for shared libraries are produced. The android\nGOOS will only support external linking, and the NDK external linker is responsible for\nactually producing the final .so file.\u003c/pre\u003e",
