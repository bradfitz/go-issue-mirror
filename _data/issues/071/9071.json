In this\ncontrived example, only user CPU increases, but throughput is maintained.\n\nThis code snippet will reproduce this condition at random times. We have a TCP proxy\nlistening for syslog data from our vendor that connects to the TLS port. We also have\nunencrypted data flowing over the raw TCP port. The trigger is unknow--sometimes it\ntakes 5 mins for CPU to jump and throughput to drop, other times ~30-40 minutes.\n\nI can try to get tcpdumps if that's needed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
