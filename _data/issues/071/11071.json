	"body": "I have some hacks I carry around locally to enable benchmarking on an iOS device:\r\n\r\n* Make tests print \"DONE\" after running benchmarks, similarly to the way they currently print \"PASS\" after running tests.\r\n* Add an envvar to go_darwin_arm_exec.go to control what string it watches for to detect that a test has completed running, and set that envvar to \"DONE\" when running benchmarks.\r\n* Add an envvar to go_darwin_arm_exec.go to enable debug mode, rather than it being a constant, and add that envvar when running benchmarks, in order to see incremental output.\r\n\r\nThis is obviously not a good solution. I don't know what a good solution looks like, but I'd like one. :)\r\n\r\n/cc @crawshaw \r\n",
