I thought there was a bug filed about this\nbut there's only one about nested unmarshalable structs, which is a separate issue.\n\nI propose that gob treat chan and func fields exactly as it now treats unexported\nfields. If there is no custom encoder for that field, it is simply ignored.\n\nIt's an easy, backwards-compatible change that will take care of a large subset of the\ncompatibility issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
