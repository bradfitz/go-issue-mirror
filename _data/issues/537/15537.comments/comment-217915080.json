	"body": "@dr2chase 'works for me' is totally valid. It's open source after all. Unfortunately I'm not so lucky. For this specific issue we may just remove the gogoprotobuf ./test packages from our repo. It seems like a pretty good test for the compiler and since it's quite a popular library it would be great if you and the rest of the compiler team would continue working towards pre-SSA memory usage and compilation times for it.\r\n\r\nWe have several large swaths of generated code internally which I haven't tried to compile yet. If they trip the compiler we'll extract some test cases early in the 1.8 cycle.\r\n\r\nThe performance improvements we're seeing with at least one high-performance component compiled with tip are pretty amazing (~30% improvements over 1.6) so I hope we can figure something out.",
