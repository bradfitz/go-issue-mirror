	"body": "Thanks, @dr2chase. It's probable that both the sparse phi and this optimization should go in; this one is good for small and general cases, and sparse is good for large ones. I'm going to run some more benchmarks (last time was low iterations and still had browser etc running) and take one more look.\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure I follow the decoration suggestion, but I'll read it again tomorrow. (Off to take my kid to the playground while some benchmarks run.) I will observe that we were actually generating O(n^2) values to avoid an O(n^2) recursion, so we are going from expensive quadratric to cheap quadratic. If you want things in sooner for freeze reasons, feel free to just submit my change and build atop it.\r\n\r\nOh, and reminder to self: There's also still some stackAlloc to look into here. :)\r\n",
