	"body": "This bug was present in Go 1.3 and the CL that introduced the bug is nearly two years old. That suggests that the failure conditions are rare enough that we can wait a bit longer to fix it. The CL that introduced the bug also shows actual library functions (sort.Strings) getting 30% faster, which is not something to roll back lightly.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what you are saying about bufio exactly, but the code you found is in Brad's new method that didn't ship in 1.4.\r\n\r\nIf someone can show me a trivial fix that isn't \"roll it back\" we can consider it for Go 1.4.2. And unless Rog speaks up and argues that it's important to fix, we can leave it for Go 1.5.\r\n\r\n",
