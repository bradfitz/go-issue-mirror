The only way I\nknow how to do this would be to force the use of cgo for any program that uses syscall,\nbut that's untenable.\n\nWhat we do in the runtime is check to see if cgo is already being used for some other\nreason, and if so we use it for things like pthread_create but otherwise fall back to\nour own implementation. I think we'd have to do something similar to play nicely with\ncgo here.\u003c/pre\u003e",
