And as you point out, it is security sensitive, so it is important to get\ncorrect.\n\nYou can find some discussion here:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/forum/#\u003c/a\u003e!searchin/golang-dev/setuid$20implementing/golang-dev/sVCQl9adDgg/-EeOdMaWT48J\n\nComparing to nginx is unhelpful, since it runs under a completely different runtime. A\nmore apt comparison would be how glibc handles it:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/lattera/glibc/search?q=SIGSETXID\u0026ref=cmdform\"\u003ehttps://github.com/lattera/glibc/search?q=SIGSETXID\u0026ref=cmdform\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhich involves sending and receiving an SIGSETXID signal and synchronizing all of the\nthreads.\n\nI've had your exact frustration with this issue. It seems simple, but it isn't, sadly.\n\ni@golang.org: could you elaborate on the setcap solution?\u003c/pre\u003e",
