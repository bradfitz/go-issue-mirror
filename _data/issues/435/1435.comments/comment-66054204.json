Of course GNU/Linux is an important web server\nplatform.\n\n\u003e At the same time, how hard is it to do what requires \"root\" permission and the lower\nit to a lower permission user?\n\nOn GNU/Linux, it's best to use the setcap mechanism, and not use root permission at all.\n setcap has been around since Linux 2.2, it's not some newfangled thing.\n\nThat said, we all agree that this bug should be fixed.  It would be great if you worked\non fixing it, rather than simply telling us that it is easy to fix.  Thanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
