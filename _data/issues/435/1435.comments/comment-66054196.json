Specially, since this\nis not even a problem while running on App Engine. Yes, that's right, on App Engine\nListenAndServe is replaced by Google's own version of it. \n\n\u003ca href=\"http://blog.golang.org/the-app-engine-sdk-and-workspaces-gopath#TOC_2\"\u003ehttp://blog.golang.org/the-app-engine-sdk-and-workspaces-gopath#TOC_2\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\"The App Engine infrastructure provides its own main function that runs its equivalent\nto ListenAndServe. To convert main.go to an App Engine app, drop the call to\nListenAndServe and register the handler in an init function (which runs before main).\"\n\nWhich makes me wonder what kind of language is Google trying to create here. Is Google's\nGolang team in a way saying that to run the language on production you have to do it on\ntheir commercial cloud infrastructure? To think of it, this is something that only comes\nfrom commercially sponsored languages. Python, Perl or any other open source language\nthat's community spearheaded wouldn't have this type of issue. Who would on the right\nmind run an http server as root?\n\nCome on guys, fix this. It's not that hard.\u003c/pre\u003e",
