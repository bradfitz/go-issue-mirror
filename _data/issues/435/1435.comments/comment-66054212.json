It looks\nlike we need to (1) set a signal handler for SIGSETXID that calls setuid/setgid system\ncall from the handler, and (2) signal all threads with SIGSETXID when setuid/setgid Go\nfunction is called. Because we don't provide syscall.sigaction, I think we don't need to\nworry about the case that a user accidentally disable SIGSETXID system call. Is there\nanything other than that we need to do for this?\u003c/pre\u003e",
