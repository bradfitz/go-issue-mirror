What did you do?\r\n\r\nepoll_event struct is defined like this in c:\r\n           \r\n           typedef union epoll_data {\r\n               void    *ptr;\r\n               int      fd;\r\n               uint32_t u32;\r\n               uint64_t u64;\r\n           } epoll_data_t;\r\n\r\n           struct epoll_event {\r\n               uint32_t     events;    /* Epoll events */\r\n               epoll_data_t data;      /* User data variable */\r\n           };\r\nmember ptr is used to save the pointer, which points to some context data.\r\n\r\nin the go1.6 runtime package (runtime/defs_linux_amd64.go), i can also find the struct member for saving the context pointer\r\n           \r\n           type epollevent struct {\r\n                  events uint32\r\n                  data   [8]byte // unaligned uintptr\r\n           }\r\nbut when it comes to syscall.EpollEvent (syscall/ztypes_linux_amd64.go) definition :\r\n          \r\n           type EpollEvent struct {\r\n                  Events uint32\r\n                  Fd     int32\r\n                  Pad    int32\r\n           }\r\ni have no room for saving a pointer, Pad only has 4 bytes.\r\n",
