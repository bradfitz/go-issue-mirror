And it still has a\nlarge startup cost which makes it impractical for small sizes.\n\nThanks for trying it out. Since I don't have an Ivy Bridge or newer myself, I couldn't\nknow for sure. I had almost expected it to be just as fast as the SSE-based copy (also\nwith less startup cost), but it seems like heavily switched memcpy's will still be\nnecessary for the foreseeable future. I guess I had assumed that the REP instructions\nhad finally started doing what they were meant to do (efficiently).\u003c/pre\u003e",
