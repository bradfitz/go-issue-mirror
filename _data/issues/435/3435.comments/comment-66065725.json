Reading the Linux source it looks\nlike that can only happen if it is passed invalid arguments (which we don't) or the\npages are locked (which can only happen if people are playing with syscalls like I am). \nSo I don't believe this fix needs to be rushed out.  The man page madvise(2) lists\nEAGAIN as a possible error result.  If that could happen, I would be more worried, but I\ndo not see a code path for that in the Linux source.\u003c/pre\u003e",
