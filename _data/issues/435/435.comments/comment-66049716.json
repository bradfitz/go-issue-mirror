For\ninstance, if you use a #defined constant, say C.FOO, and FOO looks like\n\n#define FOO some_func_call()\n\nor something similar, it will translate into invalid Go code. I personally think this\nis OK, because it doesn't make much sense to use defines in this way with the cgo\nFFI. Additionally, it's quite a pain to try to parse C further to determine whether\nit will, in fact, generate valid code.\n\nOther than that, seems to work. Patch attached so I don't lose code; contains fixes\nfor two other cgo issues though, just waiting for Russ to get back so we can get\nthings committed cleanly.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/435/2/cgo.diff\"\u003ecgo.diff\u003c/a\u003e (5790 bytes)",
