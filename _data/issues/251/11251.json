	"body": "It would be useful to annotate interfaces in the godoc with list of known implementers.\r\nUse case: I want to use text/scanner package and parse some data I receive from network. While reading its documentation I encounter a reference to io.Reader: https://golang.org/pkg/text/scanner/#Scanner.Init. I click on \"io.Reader\", and it would be nice to know that besides of net.TCPConn this interface is also implemented by bufio.NewReader, which can be used in my case.\r\n\r\nCaveat: number of types implementing trivial interfaces can be huge.",
