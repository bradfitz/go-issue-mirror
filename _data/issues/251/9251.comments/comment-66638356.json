	"body": "Thanks for the detailed bug report, fix coming soon.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of possible strategies for allocation and I agree it is not obvious what is optimal. However I suspect it is the wrong problem to focus on: when I wrote gobind I was talking to Go as a subprocess, so everything needed to be serialized. It seems entirely possible we can now avoid a lot of allocations, and write directly from seq_android.c into Go memory.\r\n\r\nEspecially for tasks like passing JSON around, where almost certainly the Java encoder is capable of producing UTF-8. The ideal type signature there would be []byte in Go and byte[] in Java, with the bytes written directly from Java to Go. (And avoiding the UTF16 -\u003e UTF-8 conversion.)",
