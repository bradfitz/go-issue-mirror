I have a bunch of hash values I want to store in a map. I guess for now I will cast []byte to string as it's prototype code. I assume that cast has to copy the bytes of the slice to the string so there is an allocation and a copy?\r\n\r\nIs there any optimization for struct{} as a value take no memory? In my case I just need to test if the hash is in the map and don't care about the value. I have lots of hashes to store in the map.",
