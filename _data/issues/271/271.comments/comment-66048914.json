I've seen the EUNAVAIL on my current i386 test box, but it\ndoesn't cause the process to commit harakiri, which I suspect is due to it executing\nserially since it's a single processor. I'm going to try to get access to a multicore\nFreeBSD/i386 install and see if I can figure out which thread it is specifically --\nthe most obvious ones in the trace don't seem to be very interesting. Though it seems\ncurious that SI is 0x1.\n\n--dho\u003c/pre\u003e",
