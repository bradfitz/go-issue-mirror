The comments in FreeBSD around sigcontext and mcontext_t implies they\nshould be interchangable, but they are in fact different... sigcontext has the\nsc_mask up in front. I guess this should do it for 386, though amd64 has the same\nproblem.\n\nIf you could reproduce with this, I think the traceback would be much more accurate.\n(I tried, but I don't have a multi-core i386 machine running FreeBSD)\n\n--dho\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/271/3/signal.diff\"\u003esignal.diff\u003c/a\u003e (2377 bytes)",
