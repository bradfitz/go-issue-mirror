	"body": "Hey!\r\n\r\nWhen working with ancillary data, it is difficult to not use `cmsgData` from the `syscall` package. The package implements FD passing but everything else will need access to the data. A [previous proposition](https://codereview.appspot.com/6448110/) was made to make the function public but was rejected due to returning `unsafe.Pointer`.\r\n\r\nI would propose to use the following signature for the public function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc CmsgData(h *Cmsghdr, len int) []byte\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt could still panic if `len` is incorrect. Is that admissible?",
