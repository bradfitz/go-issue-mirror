This might have bad\ninteractions with tools that walk the dependency graph.\n\nThis could work:\n1. Have godoc search code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd for the named command\n2. In the binary distrubitons, include the godoc/vet/cover source in\n$GOROOT/src/pkg/code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd\n\nPoint 2 has the drawback that \"go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/foo\" will fail unless\nyou remove that code from under $GOROOT. We could put a nice error message in the go\ntool for this case (eg \"Please remove the go.tools source from your $GOROOT before\ndownloading a newer version.\").\u003c/pre\u003e",
