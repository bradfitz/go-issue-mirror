Now the other goroutine calls listen on a wrong fd, which already can be reused for another socket. And now it gets a connection from a wrong passive socket and sends your private data to a wrong connection.\r\nThat's what we solve with fdmutex. You must delay actual close syscall. You can either do it asynchronously, or actually block the goroutine until it is safe to call close syscall.\r\n",
