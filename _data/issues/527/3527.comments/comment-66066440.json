Minimal effect.\n\nIt is likely that if you want to use V8 in another goroutine, you will\nhave to do it like:\n\ngo whatever()\n\nfunc whatever() {\n    runtime.LockOSThread()\n    v8.InitThread()\n    v8.Run()\n    v8.CleanupThread()\n    runtime.UnlockOSThread()\n}\n\nso that v8 has the right per-thread data in that goroutine too, and so\nthat the goroutine keeps running in a single thread the whole time.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
