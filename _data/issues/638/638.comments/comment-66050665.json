I have a \ncouple of examples in the 648-bit space where it takes 108k tries before a random \nis reached (all-in-all covering 216000 different numbers); another, in the 66-bit \nspace and using the incremental algorithm, fails to find a prime in at least the \n12,630,912 numbers between 18699199384836273063 and \n18699199384848903975. \n\np9p's probable_prime finds 4225 primes within that slice, and wolfram alpha \nconfirms at least a dozen of (somewhat) random sampled finds from there.\n\nlet me know if you want the file with the odd numbers (stepping of 4) of that slice for \ntesting.\u003c/pre\u003e",
