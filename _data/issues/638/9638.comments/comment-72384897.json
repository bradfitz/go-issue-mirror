	"body": "@PieterD why do `b = append(b, make([]byte, s)...)` instead of a precisely sized `make` followed by a copy? Avoiding append here would prevent a pointless allocation. Also, the zero argument is redundant in many cases (anywhere an allocation has occurred). It's generally accepted that, when extending the length of a slice further into its capacity, the newly visible elements will be overwritten (or otherwise ignored). In these cases, the zero argument serves no purpose either.",
