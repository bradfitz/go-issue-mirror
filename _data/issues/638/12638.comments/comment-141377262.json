In fact, the for loop on [L57](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/7733a7cad81d1e356a11a8e83221a32e5d622869/src/archive/tar/writer.go#L57) seems to indicate that this was the original purpose. However, the check on [L51](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/7733a7cad81d1e356a11a8e83221a32e5d622869/src/archive/tar/writer.go#L51) prevents use of the method unless all file contents have been written already. Is the purpose of this method really just to flush out the final padding? If that's the case, why can't ```Writer.Write``` just do that when ```nb``` hits zero?",
