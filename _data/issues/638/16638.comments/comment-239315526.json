	"body": "There is no need to handle inlining at traceback time.  Today, each PC corresponds to a single file/line/function.  When we can inline non-leaf functions, each PC corresponds to a list of file/line/function tuples.  At traceback time, we only need that PC.  At symbolization time, we need to expand that PC into a list of file/line/function tuples.  There is already code for handling this in `runtime.Frames.Next`, we just need to move from `FuncForPC` to something that can return multiple file/line/function tuples.\r\n\r\nThe point is, traceback can be fast while still supporting non-leaf inlined functions when we interpret the traceback.",
