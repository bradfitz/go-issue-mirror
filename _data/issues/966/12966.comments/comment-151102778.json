The cairo naming convention is most significant bytes to least significant bytes, and is endian-ness dependent. The Go naming convention is in memory order, and is endian-ness independent. For little-endian CPUs, cairo's least significant byte (blue) comes first, so they're the same, and the world seems to have settled on little-endian, for better or worse.",
