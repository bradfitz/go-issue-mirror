	"body": "The changes to `testdata/deadcode.go` are unfortunate though, as they effectively reduce deadcode test coverage. The \"right\" way to solve this is to only run a particular test on its own test data, or to add ERROR expectations to `testdata/deadcode.go`. The former seems like a better solution, though I'm not sure it's a change that would be sensible to make to merge this feature.",
