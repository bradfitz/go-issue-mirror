This is pretty clear for say for \"a, _ = range x\" which becomes \"a = range x\", etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, if code is under development, simplifying the select may not be desirable.\r\n\r\nI have long advocated a -ss mode (\"strong simplify\") which could do things like this (and more); and which wouldn't be restricted as much as \"-s\".",
