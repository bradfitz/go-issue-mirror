	"body": "No, I think this is different. A select with a single case is rarely ever used without a default, simply because it is not necessary or useful. A `for {}` on the other hand is useful to emulate infinite loops and loops with complex termination conditions. When people write a single case select, I suspect they generally do it because they want a non-blocking channel operation.\r\n\r\nMissing the `default:` case for a non-blocking op is also a tricky error to detect, because it might only block in corner cases or due to a race.",
