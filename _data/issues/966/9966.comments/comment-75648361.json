It certainly convinced me that making this a **build** error would be a bad idea. I do think it's sensible for `go vet` to complain about it though.\r\n\r\nFor `for {}`, the case doesn't seem as clear-cut, as this is a sensible construct for application with an actually infinite main event/dispatch loop, loops with multiple exit conditions where exit condition enumeration might make it clearer what's going on, and for loops with dynamic exit conditions.",
