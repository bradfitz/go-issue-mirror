I think it is a very useful constant in float\ncomparison, which is defined in \u0026lt;float.h\u0026gt; in C.\nI find some relative constant, such as MaxFloat32, MaxFloat64, MaxInt8\nin pkg/math/const.go. But I can't find EPSILON that defined the\nsmallest number x such that 1.0 + x != 1.0.\nIs it good to add it into the go? How about to add it into pkg/math/const.go?\nOr if I just miss it, where is it?\nThanks.\nSanbo\u003c/pre\u003e",
