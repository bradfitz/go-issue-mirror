I thought at first that converting -1 to uint8 was\ndifferent from converting 257 to uint8, but I guess either way it's the same issue: do\nyou treat conversion of float to unsigned int as a conversion from float to int followed\nby a conversion from int to unsigned int, or is it just implementation-defined.  Bsaed\non \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/3423\"\u003eissue #3423\u003c/a\u003e it's implementation defined here too.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Duplicate**._\n\n_Merged into issue #3423._",
