We could make Go releases available via GitHub as well as our [download page](https://golang.org/dl/).\r\n\r\nAssuming we want to do so, we could modify the `release` tool to create and populate those releases for us automatically.\r\n\r\nBut do we want to do this? What are the advantages? What are the disadvantages?\r\n",
