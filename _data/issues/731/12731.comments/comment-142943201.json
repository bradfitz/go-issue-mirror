	"body": "I agree that it's a little bit annoying that \"ListenAndServe\" isn't directly the same as \"Serve\" with a net.Listener. I think this should definitely be added to the docs to inform that ListenAndServe != Listen + Serve. However, I think that having a special http.Listen, which would be identical to net.Listen except for keep-alive, would be too much, and will just add to the confusion, without really solving that much.\r\n\r\nNot only does \"Listen\" by itself not say anything obvious about keep-alive, but keep-alive is in no way HTTP specific. You should do this in almost all your Accept loops. Instead, you could request for a net.ListenWithKeepAlive, but I'm not sure that request would gain much traction.",
