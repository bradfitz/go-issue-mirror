The first thing you do is dereference the\n*list.List returned from list.New:\n\n  lista = *list.New()\n\nWhen really, your lista type should be a *list.List and the line should be\n\n  lista = list.New()\n\nThis program works: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/hGVK4uONiy\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/hGVK4uONiy\u003c/a\u003e\n\nHowever, it is puzzling that it's broken, even with your unconventional approach. The\nmethods PushFront, Front, and Back all have *List as the receiver, and so they should\neach be called with a pointer to the same list.List value (lista).\n\nFor now, make the change I suggested. We'll try to figure out why this problem arose.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
