But it is possible that other program (not built by go1.6) is called timeBeginPeriod and is still runinng. This will make your PC timer run at 1ms. Until last program that called timeBeginPeriod exits. See https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/windows-timer-resolution-megawatts-wasted/ for details.\r\n\r\nAlex",
