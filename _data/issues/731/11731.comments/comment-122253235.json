However, I did spend some time trying to figure out how to use Addr.Network() since that seemed easier \u0026 possibly faster. If the interface is meant more for internal use/debugging, it might be better to document that explicitly in the Addr interface and ask people to use type assertions instead.\r\n\r\nWouldn't changing what Addr.Network returns break compatibility?
