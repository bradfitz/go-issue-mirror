	"body": "@mikioh @ianlancetaylor \r\nAs i'm going into the net package sources in detail, there's a LOT of usage of hardcoded strings for network address names in the code and implementing a fix for this issue will mean probably 150+ small changes throughout the package sources - essentially replacing many uses of strings like \"ip\", \"ip+net\" or \"unixgram\" with constants like possibly IPAddrName, IPNetAddrName or UnixGramAddrName (perhaps we could come up with better names).\r\n\r\nThe question i have is might it adversely impact maintainability of the package to make such changes in so many places? The alternative would be to simply define an exported constant block in src/net/net.go for external use but not use the constants internally",
