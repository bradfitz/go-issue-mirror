	"body": "I just hit this problem when doing oauth2 authentication with facebook. It seems the facebook http2 implementation doesn't care for the Accept-Encoding header and sends gzip no matter what. Manually adding the Accept-Encoding: gzip to the request will correctly fix the problem.\r\n\r\nI suppose this is because a previous draft of the spec required the support for gzip, they removed that since. Seems more of a bug on Twitter/Facebook side than on go. I'll let you judge.",
