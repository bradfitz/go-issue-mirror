But please also read it first.\n\nThe problem with a fuzzy len is that if you write\n\nfor i := 0; i \u0026lt; len(x); i++ {\n\nand i has type int but len(x) is some fuzzy number\nthat is bigger than any possible int, then the loop\nwill be wrong: it will wrap around and die using i\nas a (negative) loop index.\u003c/pre\u003e",
