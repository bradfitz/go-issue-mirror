The output must be valid JSON (e.g., all maps must have string keys).\r\n\r\nThe fact that you're seeing `json: unsupported type: map[int64][]int64` makes me wonder if you're really using Go 1.7+, though. That works just fine as of Go 1.7:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/1s94vUjxG5\r\n\r\nThis seems more like a question about how to use encoding/json, so I suggest you post to a forum (https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Questions) instead.",
