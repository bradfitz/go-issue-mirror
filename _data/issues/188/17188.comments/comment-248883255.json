I don't know if the wiki/forum would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nI'm running from AppEngine and I had provided a path with the current version of AppEngine, which I had compiled a few minutes before, without realizing that Go had been built-into the SDK (which makes sense). The SDK isn't yet available with something newer than 1.6.2 and the version in production probably isn't available with anything later yet. On the off-chance that you or someone listening happens to know if there's a newer version in production and how to update the AppEngine SDK to use the newer one (it needs the \"goapp\" binary) than I'm going to be stuck having to pre-translate my keys.",
