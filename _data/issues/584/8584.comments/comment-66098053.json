Automatic indirection of *T is fine and necessary.  The\nproblem is that this function automatically _addresses_ the incoming type when looking\nfor methods.  (Actually, technically, it doesn't do any \"addressing\"; it just fails to\ndiscard methods with *T receivers when T was queried.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
