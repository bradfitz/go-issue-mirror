	"body": "you need to cast it to an int.\n\nWhen generating the constants, there is no way to know whether it's\nintended as unsigned constant or signed, esp. those magic numbers.\n\nYou might argue that we can change the constants to int, but please\nnote that you can also use it in this way:\nunix.Syscall(unix.SYS_REBOOT, unix.LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_HALT, 0, 0)\n\nAnd in this case, if the constant were signed, compiler would warn about\nthe negative constant overflows uintptr.\n\nA more realistic change would be to change unix.Reboot to take a\nuintptr. But Reboot is such a uncommon API, I don't think it's worth a\nAPI change just to remove a cast.",
