	"body": "Documentation webpage [Getting Started](https://golang.org/doc/install)—in section [Test your installation](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing)—currently says:\r\n\r\n\u003e Next, make the directories src/github.com/***user***/hello inside your workspace (if you use GitHub, substitute your ***user name*** for user),\r\n\r\nThe following would be better:\r\n\r\n\u003e Next, make the directories src/github.com/user/***try-golang***/hello inside your workspace (if you use GitHub, substitute your ***GitHub*** user name for user),\r\n\r\n(The bolding is just for emphasis in this issue.)\r\n\r\nThe new text aids novice Go users, in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Novices will wonder where their GitHub [repo](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository) names fit in the pattern. This will slow them down, and be frustrating. The new text supplies the answer (`try-golang`, in this case).\r\n\r\n1. \"User name\" seems (in effect) ambiguous here.\r\n\r\nNovice Go users (by definition) are unfamiliar with the semantics of Go's workspace directory structure. For them (as well as generally, outside Go), the most commonly used context for the term \"user name\" is OS X, Linux or Windows—not GitHub.\r\n\r\nLikely they'd assume the former (as I did). They can figure it out, but why include this stumbling block in the first place?\r\n\r\nThe new text specifies it means the GitHub user name.\r\n\r\nThis change aims to help smooth the path, for new Go language users.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)? N/A\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)? N/A\r\n3. What did you do? N/A\r\n4. What did you expect to see? N/A\r\n5. What did you see instead? N/A",
