It will be replaced by the final system Ed25519 in future NaCl releases. A NaCl-compatible Ed25519 implementation is already available as part of SUPERCOP.\r\n\r\nI have an Ed25519 implementation in my personal repo and #8581 is probably going to cause it to be imported into x/crypto soon. However, it won't live in x/crypto/nacl until NaCl itself is updated to contain the final version.",
