Run this code, which tries to keep a connection open to send data:\n\u003ca href=\"http://pastie.org/805167\"\u003ehttp://pastie.org/805167\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThe expected output is 1..10. Instead, finishRequest is called and nothing \ngets sent to the client. \n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux/amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n47bb38c01374+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThe http server should never finish a request unless finishRequest is \nexplicitly called by the user. This makes it impossible to write real-time \nweb apps with go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
