The web server assumes, quite \nreasonably, that when the handler returns, the request is done being handled.  HTTP \nis a synchronous protocol, one request at a time on the wire; there's no other \npossible implementation.\n\nIf there are multiple connections then there will be multiple handlers executing in \nparallel and they can do whatever \"real time web apps\" need to do. \n\nLeaving open because the documentation should be clearer about the fact that the \nhandler returning signals that the request is done.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **documentation**._\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
