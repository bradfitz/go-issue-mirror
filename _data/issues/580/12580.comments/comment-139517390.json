	"body": "I'm a little concerned about the inconvenience and potential for temporal coupling and fragile assumptions when trying to put callbacks on an object like the Transport that can simultaneously service many libraries and threads. Somehow I need to safely and correctly associate those callbacks with my individual requests.\r\n\r\nClearly there are issues with backwards compatibility / function signatures, but in this sort of environment it would seem safer to be able to handle these callbacks in a per-request manner, either through return values or a per-request callback. In an almost ideal world, a variation of http.Client.Do would be ideal.",
