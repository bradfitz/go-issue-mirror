	"body": "by **justin@fathomdb.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI'm seeing not-great TLS performance; enabling the ClientSessionCache seems to help. \nBut it looks like even when resuming a session, we still call processCertsFromClient,\nand do an (expensive) validation of the client cert chain.\n\nTwo ideas/questions:\n\n1) Do we really need to re-validate the client cert on resume (haven't we already\nvalidated it on first-connect)?  Can the client switch certs on us?\n\n2) Is it possible to avoid any of this work using a cache?  processCertsFromClient looks\nvery cacheable to my untrained eye.  I'm thinking something similar to\nClientSessionCache in tls.Config.\n\n\nI guess I could turn off client-cert validation by the tls package, and implement my own\ncache.  It would sure be nice if this was out-of-the-box though!\n\nSession resumption makes this less important, but I don't see why we wouldn't also cache\nvalidation of server certs.\u003c/pre\u003e",
