	"body": "Probably not a bug per se. as the new behaviour is correct, however it is a compatibility breaking change. Suggest no fix, imho.\r\nRaising this issue really as a record of the difference, the minor change to keep things working in 1.5 is to truncate the key to the first 162 bytes (as long as you know you are only dealing with 1024 bit RSA PK's)  \r\n\r\n\u003eWhat version of Go are you using (go version)?\r\n\r\nUsing 1.4 then migrating to 1.5.2, also tested on 1.5.0\r\n\r\n\u003eWhat operating system and processor architecture are you using?\r\n\r\nMac OSX - but reproduceable on RedHat (not 100% sure of version but I think incedental)\r\ngo version go1.5 darwin/amd64 - via installer pkg download\r\n\r\n\u003eWhat did you do?\r\n\r\nRan a test to return involving a long public key with more bytes than needed.\r\n\r\n\u003eWhat did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nThe test pass when running on golang 1.4, and the test still pass when running on 1.5.0\r\n\r\n\u003eWhat did you see instead?\r\n\r\nThe test pass when running on golang 1.4, and the test fail when running on 1.5.0 wiht the following error\r\n\r\n\t`x509: trailing data after ASN.1 of public-key`\r\n\r\nThe offset is clearly returned from this line https://golang.org/src/encoding/asn1/asn1.go?s=26808:26872#L957\r\n\r\nThe code to reproduce is here ...\r\n\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/XkkAqFenC8\r\n\r\nthe snippet here...\r\n\r\n\tpkb, _ := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(`MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDgkHKMf4B5yc8CU29XdQIj8tQAAyOL0DM3C/F9euuFickCd2brILEhBKDH9NQomP5wc77B3vAbNH0Iza+GSPpjDJ4+Sjg9OsNP7UpWcxbfXBrN7UEUfISc9ZKrhijkS3p7M/8o78XHTjsq1PJKImakBIA0G+VoOj1pVF5BAnBl7QIDAQAB/F9euuFickCd2brILEhBKDH9NQomP5wc77B3vAbNH0IzaGSPpjDJ4Sjg9OsNP7UpWcxbfXBrN7UEUfISc9ZKrhijkS3p7M/8o78XHTjsq1PJKImakBIA0GVoOj1pVF5BAnBl7QIDAQAB`)\r\n\r\n\tpubKey, err := x509.ParsePKIXPublicKey(pkb) // err != nil\r\n",
