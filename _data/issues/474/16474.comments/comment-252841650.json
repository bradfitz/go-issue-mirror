	"body": "Haha, I just got bitten by this. In [tlsmuxd](https://github.com/nhooyr/tlsmuxd) I was copying between two TCP connections with `io.CopyBuffer`. I expected it to use my buffer from my bufferPool but it turns out that `*net.TCPConn` has the `ReadFrom` method for sendfile. However, since it was reading from a `net.Conn` sendfile did not apply and it fell back to `io.Copy`. Consequently, my buffer was unused and there was a buffer allocation in `io.Copy`. \r\n\r\nLuckily, I read `*net.TCPConn`'s source one day so I realized my mistake but I've retracted my original view that it a compat issue because I think that this is extremely subtle, unintuitive and I cannot imagine anyone who passes in a buffer to `io.CopyBuffer` but does not expect it to be used. I understand that it was documented to behave just like `io.Copy`, but why would you pass in a buffer if you aren't sure it will be used? It just doesn't make any sense.",
