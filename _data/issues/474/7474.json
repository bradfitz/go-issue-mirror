	"body": "\u003cpre\u003econnect frequently fails under DragonFly BSD, especially to localhost. The TestErrorNil\nand TestSelfConnect tests are easy ways to reproduce the problem. The issue is related\nto the fact that Go does a syscall.Connect on a non-blocking socket, then waits for the\nsocket to become writable. When it does we call syscall.Connect again on the same\nsocket, expecting that it will return syscall.EISCONN or the error that was previously\nencountered.\n\nUnder DragonFly BSD this fails since the second syscall.Connect appears to retry the\nconnection and results in an syscall.EINPROGRESS. As a result, we sit in a loop:\n\n954:2  net.test CALL  connect(0x3,0xc20800c40c,0x10)\n954:2  net.test RET   connect -1 errno 36 Operation now in progress\n954:2  net.test CALL  kevent(0x4,0,0,0x7fffff9fd6c8,0x40,0x7fffff9fd6b0)\n954:2  net.test RET   kevent 2\n954:2  net.test CALL  connect(0x3,0xc20800c40c,0x10)\n954:2  net.test RET   connect -1 errno 36 Operation now in progress\n954:2  net.test CALL  kevent(0x4,0,0,0x7fffff9fd6c8,0x40,0x7fffff9fd6b0)\n954:2  net.test RET   kevent 2\n954:2  net.test CALL  connect(0x3,0xc20800c40c,0x10)\n954:2  net.test RET   connect -1 errno 36 Operation now in progress\n954:2  net.test CALL  kevent(0x4,0,0,0x7fffff9fd6c8,0x40,0x7fffff9fd6b0)\n\nInstead, of repeated syscall.Connect calls we should use the the SO_ERROR socket option\nto see if the connection succeeded or failed.\n\nFor more details see:\n\n  \u003ca href=\"http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/commits/2013-August/197962.html\"\u003ehttp://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/commits/2013-August/197962.html\u003c/a\u003e\n\nSetting kern.ipc.soconnect_async=0 provides the same behaviour as other BSDs\n(discovered/confirmed by Mikio).\u003c/pre\u003e",
