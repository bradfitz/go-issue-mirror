I read `glob`'s comment as specifying the order in which it appends items to the argument, which is not at all guaranteed to be the order that `Glob` returns. I also don't think we need to, ahem, specify that it is unspecified in a comment. There are many things all over the standard library that have undocumented additional behavior.
