The goal is explicitly to _not_ start printing anything that might be useful, like godoc does.\n\nIt's possible that if there are no Go source files in a directory, we could list the subdirectories, but I don't even think that's right: then we'd have to decide whether to print them when there is a valid package that also has subdirectories, and I think the answer that must be no. If you say 'go doc math' you are not (usually) asking about math/rand.\n\nIn this case, there is already a command for listing packages: go list, as in `go list ./...`.",
