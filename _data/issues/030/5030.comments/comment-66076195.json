Perhaps a smaller backlog increases performance by\ngiving the server less work to do. Seems unlikely but you never know.\n\nAnother possibility is that the system call is truncating the value to 16\nbits. Seems even less likely.\n\nIf you run the server under strace -f -e listen, what argument is shown for\nthe listen system call?\u003c/pre\u003e",
