I can't\nsee how it could happen (syscall.SOMAXCONN is 0x80, and even if\n/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn said 0, the function wouldn't use it).\n\nWhat does cat /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn say? I half expect you to say -1.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **go1.1maybe**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
