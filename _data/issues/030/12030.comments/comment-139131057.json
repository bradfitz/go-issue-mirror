Or maybe in import section.\r\n\r\n\u003e ... to remove the dependency on NtWaitForSingleObject. ...\r\n\r\nAs far as I remember rsc added call to NtWaitForSingleObject in usleep because he didn't have enough stack to call standard runtime.stdcall function (back in the days when runtime was written in C). It is also little bit quicker (because it does not need runtime.cgocall and friends). I wouldn't bother changing it.\r\n\r\nAlex",
