	"body": "The large constant in `Mod32` is generated by the frontend, the node of which has line number 0. The constant in `Mod64` is generated by SSA optimization, where the line number propagates through. In the legacy backend, if we set the line number to 0, it does not change `lineno` (`cmd/compile/internal/gc/subr.go:/setlineno`). Maybe we can do the same in `pushLine` when building SSA?",
