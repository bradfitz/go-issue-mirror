If possible, please install debug symbols for gdb first. Unfortunately (and ironically), it looks like Ubuntu doesn't ship debug symbols for gdb. @pebbe, I'm not sure what you're running, so I wasn't able to check.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncat \u003e/tmp/test.go \u003c\u003cEOF\r\npackage main\r\nimport \"fmt\"\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tmapvar := make(map[string]string,5)\r\n\tmapvar[\"abc\"] = \"def\"\r\n\tmapvar[\"ghi\"] = \"jkl\"\r\n\tstrvar := \"abc\"\r\n\tptrvar := \u0026strvar\r\n\tfmt.Println(\"hi\") // line 10\r\n\t_ = ptrvar\r\n}\r\nEOF\r\ngo build /tmp/test.go\r\ngdb -ex run --args gdb -nx -ex \"br test.go:10\" -ex run -ex \"goroutine 2 bt\" test\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen this starts spiraling out of control (presumably almost immediately), hit Ctrl-c. This should drop into the outer gdb. Do a \"bt\" to get the stack trace of the inner gdb and paste in the output.",
