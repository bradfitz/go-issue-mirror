I had no problems, but have one suggestion.\n\nAt the end of the installation I think you should be prompted for a directory where you\nwant your own Go programs to go with a default of say %HOMEPATH%\\go. Then the installer\nshould create this directory, plus %HOMEPATH%\\go\\src and set the GOPATH environment\nvariable. Then the user can simply create their apps and pkgs in %HOMEPATH%\\go\\src and\neverything will \"just work\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
