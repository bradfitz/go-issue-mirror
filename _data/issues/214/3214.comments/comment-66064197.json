Would be nice if the\ninstaller handled this for you.\n\n2) The \"go build\" command is working slightly differently, previously if you entered:\n\"go build myfile.go\"\nYou would get an executable of \"myfile.exe\", now running the same command will give you\na file of \"myfile\" without an extension which Windows then refuses to run.  I think that\nthe old behaviour was nicer for new users as it means that they don't have to enter a\n\"-o\" flag each time when trying out sample programs.\u003c/pre\u003e",
