That's why combining addition helped. It may also help to say x = x + y instead\nof x += y (I'm not 100% sure about that).\n\nThis is certainly unfortunate for 1.3 but it only affects very large functions. Even\nwith more registerization (by increasing 6g/opt.h's NGRN) it's not as fast as 1.2. As\nfar as I can tell the compiler was ending up with better register choices in 1.2 almost\nby blind luck.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.4**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
