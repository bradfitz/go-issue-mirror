	"body": "Thanks for your comments, now I understand that conn-level flow control is used to limit total memory per connection that could be smaller then max_steams * steam_window_size. In that case, it makes sense to have a larger conn-level flow window. It might be helpful to add an option, different user may have different limitations.\r\nI found QUIC flow control doc we may reference:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1F2YfdDXKpy20WVKJueEf4abn_LVZHhMUMS5gX6Pgjl4/edit?usp=sharing\r\nPlease feel free to change the title if you like.\r\n\r\n",
