	"body": "Go is following the spec. There is both connection-level and stream-level flow control, and Go is respecting both. Your proposed patch just ignores connection-level flow control entirely. That isn't correct.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked you to file the bug, the question was about whether our default values for stream- and connection-level flow should be different. I forget what they are, and I don't know offhand what other servers are using by default. It's possible we need to make our connection-level ones be some factor larger than our stream-level ones, so it would take N blocked streams to block the whole connection.\r\n\r\nBut we're not going to ignore connection-level flow control and infinitely buffer all blocked streams' data in memory.\r\n",
