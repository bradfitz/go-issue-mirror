I skimmed the docs for those linkers and I didn't see any corresponding option.\r\n\r\nI have a different idea that may be simpler.  This is only an issue for internal linking.  Let's have cmd/dist run `ld -nostdlib -Wl,-r -Wl,--whole-archive -lgcc` to get libgcc as a single object.  Let's store that somewhere under pkg, and link against it when using internal linking.",
