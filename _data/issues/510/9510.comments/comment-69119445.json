I doubt the go tool will need to add anything special.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately as minux notes your item 3 is problematic.  For internal linking it would be best if we didn't have to assume that libgcc.a was available at link time.  But we also don't want to link it into the .o we build for the package that uses cgo.  Unfortunately at the time we build that package we don't know whether we will be doing internal linking or not.  We probably don't want to copy libgcc.a around, and we probably don't want to build every cgo package twice.  I don't have a simple solution for this.",
