I'm not sure if this helps other people or not, but I thought I'd post a very ugly, hacky, etc workaround that however did solve the issue I hit with the multiple definitions (notably, it was some NDK stack unwinding code duplication). \r\n\r\nThe temporary workaround that I've found to fix this issue is to request the external linker to allow multiple definitions. Maybe this is not the correct solution in the general case, but for my specific scenario I'm rebuilding things from scratch, so all code referencing the same symbol is sure to use the same version.\r\n\r\n`-extldflags=-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition`\r\n\r\nIf this is something very very bad, please enlighten me :)",
