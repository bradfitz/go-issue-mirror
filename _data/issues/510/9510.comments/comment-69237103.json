In internal linking mode and *only* if there are cgo-using packages from outside of stdlib, use \"gcc -Wl,-r -o _allall.o ... -nostdlib -lgcc ...\" to resolve libgcc dependencies.\r\n\r\nI looked over the stdlib's cgo dependencies and they seem pretty basic, so I'd be surprised if they end up depending on libgcc.  So it's hopefully just non-stdlib cgo objects that should be an issue.\r\n\r\nAs for Windows, if there are cgo-using packages from outside of stdlib, that seems like a good signal that GCC should be available.  Unless we're concerned about supporting Windows users without GCC receiving pre-compiled *non-stdlib* cgo packages too?  (I'm inclined to argue users that want to do that should simply be required to also install GCC.)",
