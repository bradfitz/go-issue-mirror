The worker goroutine fails and terminates silently\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nIt should crash and show a stack trace. Instead it runs fine. If the crash\nhappens on a main goroutine, the program runs great. \n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\ndarwin/386\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\ne73e37a4a6da tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI'm not sure if there's a runtime option to enable stack trace dumps when\ngoroutine crashes. Right now I'm writing a work queue system which runs on\nmany goroutines, and debugging is annoying because of the silent fails.\u003c/pre\u003e",
