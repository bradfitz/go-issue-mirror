We may consider supporting flexible error type bindings but currently, the only way I can think of is either to use the error text as the key for matching errors, or design your API to return a structured error information based on your application's need instead. For example, let it return a struct that returns a integer code and the error details etc in case of error, or nil in case of success.\r\n",
