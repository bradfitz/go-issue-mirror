	"body": "When go tool pprof encounters an error, it writes to STDERR but still exits with a 0 status code. This means that Go's own exec package does not detect errors from the \"go tool pprof\" command.\r\n\r\nHere is some code that produces the issue.\r\n\r\n    cmd := exec.Command(\"go\", \"tool\", \"pprof\", \"http://thiswillcauseanerror.com\")\r\n    out, err := cmd.Output() // error is nil!\r\n\r\nFor now, I am checking if anything is written to STDERR as a workaround.",
