This is confusing because y.go cannot see x.go's fmt.\n\nThe order should be swapped so that the error is always reported at the import. In this\ncase it would be at x.go:2 saying that fmt is being redeclared and the previous\ndeclaration was at y.go:2. This makes sense because x.go *can* see y.go's func.\u003c/pre\u003e",
