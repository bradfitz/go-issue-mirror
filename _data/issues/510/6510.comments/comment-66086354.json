I consider\nsplitting of float64/int64/uint64 into uintptr is OK for this level (syscall). Perhaps\nwe can provide some little functions to help with splitting here.\n\n\u003e On amd64 it is either CX or X0 you cannot passed 8 args in registers only 4 with those\n8\n\u003e registers.  MS talks about unprototyped functions and how all 8 are considered\nvolatile every call.\n\nI am not familiar with this technology, so, please, explain again what else you think is\nneeded (on top of 4 new lines as per\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/6510?c=11)\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/6510?c=11)\u003c/a\u003e to call all these functions in\nopengl32.dll. Thank you.\n\n\u003e Simple DLL with a few functions\n\u003e ...\n\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bryanturley/issue6510\"\u003ehttps://github.com/bryanturley/issue6510\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThank you for doing that. You are using int, float and double in your C code there. How\nlarge are these? I am bit concerned about Go call matching these parameters.\n\nBut since you've mentioned opengl32.dll, why don't we call glClearDepth and glClearColor\nthere instead? We won't need gcc for that test then. Also the test would be a nice\nsimple example for other users.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
