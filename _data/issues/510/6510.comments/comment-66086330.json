No one\ncomplained about it yet.\n\nI am not sure what the proper solution is yet. Your proposal is simple enough, but we\nneed to see the performance impact of your additional code. Also, this needs to be\nimplemented on 386 too. So both implementations needs to be considered before committing\non a plan of actions here. Perhaps we should add a new syscall API here.\n\nFeel free to push this along. I'll help in whatever way I can.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
