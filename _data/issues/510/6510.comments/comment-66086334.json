All APIs we call (Windows system dlls) use int parameters only.\n\n\u003e The first function is called asmstdcall but performs a fastcall, stdcall uses only\nstack.  I have still not actually found official docs for 32bit calling convention in\nwindows. \n\nYou are correct. The reason it has stdcall in the name is historical. We had 32 bit\nwindows version first. And that uses stdcall. Then we ported code to amd64, but kept\nnames unchanged.\n\n\u003e ... This is the most credible source I have found so far\n\u003ca href=\"http://agner.org/optimize/calling_conventions.pdf\"\u003ehttp://agner.org/optimize/calling_conventions.pdf\u003c/a\u003e\n\nHere are some of my 64bit call convention bookmarks:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/14/58579.aspx\"\u003ehttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/14/58579.aspx\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/freik/archive/2005/03/17/398200.aspx\"\u003ehttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/freik/archive/2005/03/17/398200.aspx\u003c/a\u003e\n\nYou should find tons of stdcall convention explanations on the web.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
