In particular, float3 does not go in the third\nfloating point register.\n\nsyscall.Syscall is really for system calls. That concept is a bit tortured\non Windows, but even so it is really for talking to system DLLs, which do\nnot use floating point.\n\nI think for wrapping arbitrary libraries the answer really has to be cgo.\nIt has type information and can do the right thing.\u003c/pre\u003e",
