Here's what we got from PAN support... \r\n\r\n\u003e According to ASN.1 coding rule modulus values starting with bytes \r\n\u003e higher than 0x80 are always treated as negative values, and as such \r\n\u003e should be prefixed with 0x00. In your certificate example modulus hex \r\n\u003e value starts with 0x88 and that is why it is presented with additional \r\n\u003e 0x00 when parsed by open-ssl (00:aa:32:1d...). two 0s are added by \r\n\u003e open ssl during parsing because of ASN.1 coding rule.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e The problem here is that PAN doesn't put 00s in front of the modulus \r\n\u003e value of on the fly certificates, which makes them being treated as \r\n\u003e irregular on the systems that rely on ASN.1 standard.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e This is a known issue to us and we already have a bug # 59030 for it \r\n\u003e which has been fixed in PAN-OS 6.0.1 release. So release 6.0.1 and \r\n\u003e newer resolve this issue.\r\n\r\nDon't know if PAN is using gnutls certtool, but figured I would share for anybody going web proxy thru a corporate firewall, etc...",
