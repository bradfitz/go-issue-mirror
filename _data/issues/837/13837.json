	"body": "Fork of some discussion in #13685\r\n\r\nLet's figure out User-Agents in Go 1.7: perhaps an optional func field on http1 and http2 Transports to modify the User-Agent before it's sent out?\r\n\r\n```go\r\n   SetUserAgent  func(old string) string\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr fields for the default value to set if unset? Or a field to append? Maybe those are the two common requests.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the stdlib's private http2 Transport should use the public http1.Transport's same options, and this should all have new clientserver_test.go additions similar to https://go-review.googlesource.com/18284\r\n\r\n/cc @okdave @rakyll @adg ",
