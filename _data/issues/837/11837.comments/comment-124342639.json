If the net package abandons taking that responsibility, users could not implement an application which needs to be run on multi-homed nodes. I think that source and/or destination address selection is part of IP routing, and we've introduced the feature for fancy connect-by-name method in go1.5. Seems like we need to make the feature work correctly for both [dst:name, src:literal] and [dst:name, src:wildcard] cases.",
