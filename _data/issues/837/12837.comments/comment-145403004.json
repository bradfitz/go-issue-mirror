And I think the godoc heuristic\nis much better than just grouping by source files.\n\n3rd question, the way godoc organizes functions/methods under a\nparticular type is based on the following heuristic:\n1. the method on that type\n2. any func that returns that type\nare related to the type, so they should be grouped with the type.\n\nPlease see https://golang.org/wiki/Questions how to ask questions.\nThe issue tracker is intended for bug reports and proposals.\n",
