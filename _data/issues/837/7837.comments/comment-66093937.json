A package is a namespace. Many languages treat\nnamespaces differently.\n\nPerhaps you could optionally use \"#\" as a prefix for a package name without specifying\nit. So if you did`import \"net/url\"` you could use #url.Parse(...) or url.Parse(...). The\nurl.Parse(...) would not work if you used \"url\" as a variable but #url would still work.\u003c/pre\u003e",
