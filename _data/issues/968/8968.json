	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI'm watching a friend trying to use godoc -analysis mode and it's apparent that there\nare a few areas for improvement:\n\n-- when a package has a parse error, just skip that package. Blake has $GOPATH=$HOME and\n$HOME/src/** also has non-Go stuff, like Postgres. And Postgres has its own *.s files,\nwhich aren't Go-style assembly. So godoc barfs.\n\n-- analysis mode is too slow with a large GOPATH, and he has a large GOPATH. Our next\nattempt was to make a new GOPATH just for godoc -analysis with symlinks to the subset of\npackages we care about. But godoc and/or -analysis don't get along well with symlinks. \nSo:\n\n-- perhaps godoc needs its own -analysis-filter=[pattern] flag for a regexp or\ncomma-separated list of packages / globs (implicitly including all dependent packages\nthereof).  e.g. --analysis-filter=foo.com/...,bar.com/baz,github.com/bradfitz/bar/...\n\n-- log progress output in verbose mode? sometimes we think it's hung. Some reassuring\nprogress would be nice.\n\nThanks!\u003c/pre\u003e",
