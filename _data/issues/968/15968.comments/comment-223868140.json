Mine is an OR of many different conditions. \r\n\r\nBut to answer your question, I think the advantage of including the case statement I mentioned is that it's logically consistent with the rest of the language.\r\n\r\nThe technical advantages are that it allows big matches on error conditions (and other things) while keeping some variables limited in scope (as in my example).\r\n\r\nI don't really have the cycles to go through this long proposal process, but I was hoping I had planted a useful seed here. If you implement it, a props to @purpleidea would be classy.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJames",
