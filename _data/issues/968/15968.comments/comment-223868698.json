Oops.\r\n\r\nFWIW, a cleaner way of expressing OR in a switch:\r\n\r\n```\r\nswitch {\r\ncase err == etcdserver.ErrStopped,\r\n  err == raft.ErrStopped,\r\n  isGrpc(etcdserver.ErrStopped),\r\n  isGrpc(grpc.ErrClientConnClosing):\r\n  if delayErr, ok := err.(*CtxDelayErr); ok {\r\n    // TODO: do some stuff here...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003e I don't really have the cycles to go through this long proposal process, but I was hoping I had planted a useful seed here.\r\n\r\nOkay, well I'll close the issue until such time as someone wants to pursue it.",
