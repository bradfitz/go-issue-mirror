The result is having to enter your username and password for private repos.\nThis can be problematic when you have multiple private repos to pull from.\n\nThere should be an option for that if a repo is private git@ should be used instead of\nhttps://. That way the configured SSH certificate can be used instead.\u003c/pre\u003e",
