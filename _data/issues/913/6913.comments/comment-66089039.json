Presumably the dwarf debug info is still quite off, as in this\nbug's example above with two i variables.\n\nIf somebody would orient me towards where the problem lies (if known), I would take a\nstab at fixing it. It's really, really annoying to have gdb tell you very wrong\ninformation about a variable when debugging.\u003c/pre\u003e",
