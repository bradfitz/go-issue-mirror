You don't have to say branch= sometimes or tag= other times, just like you don't have to tell, say, git checkout what kind of argument you are giving it.\r\n\r\nQ2. No, older versions of the go command will ignore the \\\u003cmeta\u003e tag entirely, resulting in not being able to resolve the reference. That's fine. If you need to specify a branch, then you can't speak to them.\r\n",
