Regardless of what the final decision, at least, we need to be consistent and apply the same convention to gomobile.\r\n\r\n(FWIW, the only justification to write to stderr might be able to diff between `-v` vs `-n` and `-v` vs `-x` prints. I don't have background about the current behavior and would like to have more context. -n is used to test the tools and I don't think the informative comments are a necessity there and they are written to stdout just like the other verbose output.)",
