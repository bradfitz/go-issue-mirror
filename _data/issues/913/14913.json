	"body": "Ok, I had this thought. What if the all the variables could be a stack. The := operator could push the stack or behave normally. Ie, := will create a new variable or will push a stack on an existing variable. = assigns positition 0 on the stack. Subsequent reads pops the stack, unless it is the last element which is persistent across reads.\r\n\r\nJust a thought.\r\n",
