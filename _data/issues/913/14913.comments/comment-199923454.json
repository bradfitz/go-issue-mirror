	"body": "This is an interesting idea, but unfortunately the time for language changes has long passed. Also, note that your feature would make it rather difficult to reason about code: Let's say your := is inside a \"for\" loop\r\n```\r\nvar x T\r\nfor ... {\r\n   x := foo()\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIs the stack popped after the for loop or is it as tall as the number of iterations? If it's popped, when is it popped (after each iteration, or at the end of the loop)? And so \"Forth\"... :-)\r\n\r\nIn short, I think such a feature would have a hard time in a structured language such as Go.",
