I used subdirectories with only *_test.go files to organize\nfunctional tests and keep them separately from the main .go source files and unit tests.\n It would be great to make \"go build\" and \"go install\" to skip the directories with only\n_test.go files so that \u0026lt;pkgdir\u0026gt;/... invocation could work as before.\n\nAdding a dummy.go file (with only \"package \u0026lt;packagename\u0026gt;\" line) works but it feels\nlike a rather non-elegant workaround.\u003c/pre\u003e",
