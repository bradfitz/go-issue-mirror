	"body": "Now you are discussing toolchain compatibility, which I believe that is a far less important problem than end-user binaries.\r\n\r\nOn toolchain compatibility: I agree that we could fall out of sync easily. However, two points. Firstly, the consequences are far easier to manage. We release a new Go and say for macOS N, you need Go M. \r\n\r\nSecondly, external linking does not help. The object files we produce for the external linker have as mercurial a format as the dynamic linker. If anything the problem with external linking is worse, because the only compiler Apple cares about is developed and released with a matching linker version in Xcode. The Go toolchain's external linking can be broken by Xcode point releases.",
