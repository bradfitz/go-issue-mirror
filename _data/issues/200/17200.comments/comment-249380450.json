But Apple has clearly demonstrated that, unlike most Unix systems, they regard the stable ABI not as the kernel boundary, but as the shared C library boundary.  And while it's true that we can do our own dynamic linking with the shared C library, that format is undocumented and also subject to change.\r\n\r\nI don't feel all that strongly about this--I don't use Darwin myself.
