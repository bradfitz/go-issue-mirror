When you have a function\n\nfunc twice(x uint16) uint16 { return 2*x }\n\nyou do not have to specify the endian-ness of x.\n\nSimilarly, you do not have to specify the endian-ness\nof the elements of the []uint16 UTF-16 representations.\n\nIf the utf16 package supported writing a []uint16 to\ndisk or reading it back, then endian-ness would be\nimportant.  For that context, though, there is already\nencoding/binary, which does force you to specify\nthe endian-ness.  (Even better, read and write UTF-8.)\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
