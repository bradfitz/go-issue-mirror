What's odd is that nothing\nseems to have changed in the RPi at all. It hasn't been rebooted, no procesess have been\nstarted/killed, I am even testing everything in the same screen session!\n\nLast night I also noticed this crash would also happen when running 'go version', not\nonly on this mercurial changeset, but on others too. I will re-try later today and see\nwhat happens.\u003c/pre\u003e",
