I suppose we could mess with http.DefaultTransport, but that's probably too magical and frail. So it'll have to be opt-in, which means new API. Sad.\r\n\r\nMaybe it could just be a method on the unstarted server to return a Client, and that's it. And requesting that client opts you into the fast mode, once Start is called? Or more explicit might be to set a bool on the UnstartedServer, and then also add a Client() *http.Client method which works regardless of the bool.\r\n",
