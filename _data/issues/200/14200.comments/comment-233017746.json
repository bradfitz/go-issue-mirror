	"body": "I like the method that sets up the server and returns a special client. One potential issue, though, which can be solved potentially with a parameter to the new method but I'm still trying to figure out a good way to do it: If the server's handler redirects to another URL, then the client needs a way to figure out that the request shouldn't use the pipe. I can think of a couple of solutions:\r\n\r\n* Use naive string matching on addresses in the dial function, and pass things through to `net.Dial` if it doesn't match.\r\n* Allow the user to pass a function that determines a match. This is the most configurable. Could default to one of the other options if the user passes nil.\r\n* Do something fancy with `Server.URL`. This one's the simplest from the user's point of view, but also the least configurable.\r\n* Don't worry about this at all, and just document that if the handler redirects then the new pipe-based system shouldn't be used. Easiest to implement, but makes it less of a drop-in replacement.",
