I'm currently thinking of just adding a single, top-level function that returns both a Listener, for use in an httptest.Server, and an http.Transport.Dial implementation. If I'm understanding the code correctly, that should be feasible. Does that sound like a good way of doing it?\r\n\r\nEdit: On second thought, that way of doing this wouldn't really be very HTTP-specific. Do you want this in the httptest package?",
