However, I'd\nlike to know more about the security problem of vsyscalls if possible.\nThanks.\n\nOn non-amd64 Linux systems, we always invoke syscall directly,\nso this issue only affects amd64.\n\nOn amd64, when VDSO is not available, we fallback to the fixed\nmapped helpers function for gettimeofday (at 0xffffffffff600000), if\nGo binary doesn't work for VDSO-disabled kernels, then the fixed\ngettimeofday mapping is not available, right? Is there a way for\nGo binary to detect such a case easily?\n",
