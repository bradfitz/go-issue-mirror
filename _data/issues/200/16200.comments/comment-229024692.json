	"body": "This is working as intended.\r\n\r\nIt prints 5 hellos because of the `say(\"hello\")` function calls does that exactly 5 times, with a 100ms pause between each printout. Once it reaches the `go say(\"world\")`, it will start a goroutine which asynchronously starts executing `say(\"world\")`. Since `main` does not block on the goroutine, it will keep executing and reach the end of the `main` function. Once `main` returns, the program exits even if there are goroutines still running. At this point in time, the goroutine running `say(\"world\")` is still executing `time.Sleep`, so it never got around to printing anything.",
