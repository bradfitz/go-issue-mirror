	"body": "by **nix@google.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe current approach to JSON marshalling of bignums is to encode them as huge JSON\nnumbers. This is technically in compliance with the JSON spec, but not actually\ninteroperable with other JSON implementations - and interop is the major reason to use\nJSON instead of Gob.\n\nI'm wondering if there is any way to revisit this, and marshal big numbers as strings?\nOtherwise we are going to have to use wrapper structs around the crypto types so that we\ncan tack on a custom MarshalJSON implementation.\n\nFWIW, marshalling as strings would also enable the serialization of rational bignums.\u003c/pre\u003e",
