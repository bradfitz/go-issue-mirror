	"body": "The functions in xor.go in crypto/cipher are only optimized to recognize aligned cases for 386 and amd64.  This performs very poorly on ppc64le \u0026 ppc64.\r\n\r\nThere is a TODO comment in this file that mentions using the more efficient functions when the alignment is the same.  I have a patch to try this for ppc64le/ppc64 (and easily adaptable to other platforms where it applies).  I will post the patch shortly.\r\n\r\nLooks like further performance improvements could be done by writing this in asm, but one step at a time.",
