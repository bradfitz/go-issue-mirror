No error is returned, but the duplicate handle cannot be used.\r\n\u003e * Sockets. No error is returned, but the duplicate handle may not be recognized by Winsock at the target process. Also, using DuplicateHandle interferes with internal reference counting on the underlying object. To duplicate a socket handle, use the WSADuplicateSocket function.\r\n",
