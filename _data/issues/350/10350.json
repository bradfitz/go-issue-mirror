	"body": "I am writing something that requires access to the file descriptor of a socket created by net.Dial (which returns a net.conn)  and then recast as net.TCPConn so that I can use net.TCPConn.File().Fd().\r\n\r\nHowever, (as the error message says), \"dup is not supported on windows\". for my purposes, I don't \"need\" the dup() and would love to settle for just getting the raw file descriptor, but sadly the code within conn.File() appears as follows.\r\n\r\nhttps://golang.org/src/net/net.go?s=5510:5555#L195\r\n```golang\r\nfunc (c *conn) File() (f *os.File, err error) { return c.fd.dup() }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there any way I could ask for an \"if windows then just return c.fd\" option? Hopefully this request isn't a waste of time, I am far from an expert on go.",
