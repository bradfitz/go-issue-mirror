	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI added the following patch:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/159150043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/159150043\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIt seems to fix failures that we were having on one of two Solaris build machines.  The\nfix involves making sure that times returned by cputicks() are strictly increasing.\n\ncputicks just runs RDTSC, so os-dependent behavior is odd.  My only suspicion is that\nSolaris doesn't keep the cpu counter synchronized between processors, so when a\ngoroutine moves between processors the clock can look like it goes backwards.\n\nAny idea if this is the case?  There's not so much something to fix here as I'm curious\nto understand what is going on.\u003c/pre\u003e",
