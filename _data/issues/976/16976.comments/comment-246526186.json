How do you tell the difference between:\r\n```\r\n    b := make([]byte, 126)\r\n    b = append(b, []byte{...128 bytes...})\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\n    var s struct{data [126]byte; dontClobberMe byte }\r\n    b := s.data[:]\r\n    b = append(b, []byte{...128 bytes...})\r\n```\r\nIn the first situation you can reuse the backing array, but in the second case you can't.  But you can't tell based on simply the type passed to append and the rounded-up size of the allocation area.",
