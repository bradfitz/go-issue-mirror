It would only work for bytes, but I am not sure there are use cases for other types.\r\n\r\nAlso, would you mind clarifying your opposition?  The change I was originally proposing is an implementation change, not a language change.  It would be possible to make `append(foo)` work for this implementation of Go without harming or breaking other implementations.  GCC Go would continue to work.  The change as I have described is at best a minor performance perk to those who care, and at worst a no-op in other implementations.  ",
