	"body": "By default, unless you did something unusual when you built the Go compiler, the Go DNS client simply calls the system function getaddrinfo in this case.  That error means that getaddrinfo returned EAI_NONAME.  That is usually displayed as \"Name or service not known\" but to make the different DNS implementations more compatible the Go library converts it to \"no such host\".\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as far as I can see, the getaddrinfo function has no way to indicate a timeout or a failure to contact the DNS servers.  When using the native Go DNS client, it is possible to get a timeout error.  When calling getaddrinfo, which is the default, that is not possible.\r\n\r\nIf you build your own Go distribution, you can force use of the native Go DNS client rather than getaddrinfo by building your program with \"go build -tags netgo -installsuffix netgo\".  But I don't see any way to fix this with the default build.",
