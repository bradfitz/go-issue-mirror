Specifically,\nwhat does the Root field say?  If it is \"\", that confirms my theory.\n\nAnd yet the output line beginning with # makes clear that at least\npart of the go command believes that you are in a directory with a\nroot.\n\nIs it possible that there is a stale juju directory tree earlier in\nyour GOPATH or in the GOROOT itself?  In that situation the go command\ndoes try to avoid believing that the current directory might be the\ncanonical juju package (since it is shadowed by that other one).\u003c/pre\u003e",
