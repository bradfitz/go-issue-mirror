TCP permits such a packet, but also says\nthat the recipient isn't supposed to act on it until the connection is verified, since\nthe initial SYN packet could've had its source IP/port spoofed. TCP_FASTOPEN is a\nformalized version of that which isn't susceptible to spoofing.\n\nI never knew that AcceptEx makes that optional. I suppose a Windows webserver could use\nAcceptEx w/ data and verify first it's a GET request to a public resource and send the\nresponse immediately.  I remember IE / Microsoft doing this years ago (to win HTTP\nbenchmarks?), but I didn't remember how. Interesting.\u003c/pre\u003e",
