	"body": "The Go Mobile project targets two use cases\r\n- Bind app: where Java or Objective-C code can use exported names from a (non-main) Go package.\r\n- Native Go app: starts with the 'main' package that depends on golang.org/x/mobile/app. \r\n\r\nFor details, see https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Mobile\r\n\r\nThe 'basic' example is a Native Go app, and the 'bind' example is a Bind app example. I noticed you simply copied the basic example code to hello.go: 1) there is no exported names from your hello package, 2) golang.org/x/mobile/app is for the native app (The bind and the app packages don't mix well yet currently)\r\n\r\nTo build the 'basic' example, follow the instruction given in the https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/example/basic.\r\n\r\nThe error message must be improved.\r\n\r\nBTW, golang-nuts@ or http://forum.golangbridge.org will be a better place for this type of questions.\r\n",
