So the Go compiler now rejects the \"foo = bar\" assignment\nbecause \"*_Ctype_struct_Foo\" and \"*_Ctype_struct_Bar\" are distinct types.\n\nThus I think the \"expected output\" from the issue report is now satisfied, though it\nmight be worthwhile if someone could verify on OS X too.\u003c/pre\u003e",
