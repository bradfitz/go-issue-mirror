It's true if you use a Ruby hash, you can handle this situation easily\nby doing something like:\n\nJSON::parse(data).to_a\n\nThis lets you convert any json value  (i.e 'nil', '{}', '[]', [1,2,3], etc..) into an\narray without an error. \n\nHowever, there isn't a type in Go that corresponds to a Ruby dict or a python hash.\nThat's why it would be nice if json.Unmarshal were accepting of these kinds of issues\nthat arise in loosely-typed languages like Javascript.\u003c/pre\u003e",
