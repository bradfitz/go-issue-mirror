Or maybe change the stack := string(..) to a fmt.Println() and import \"fmt\" if\nit isn't there already. And presto, you have something like (the deprecated?)\ndebug.Prinstack()! \n\nSimple things should be done simply; printing the callstack is useful enough that for me\nit warrants a routine. \n\nBut that said, it's a judgement call whether this warrants adding to the standard\nlibrary in non-deprecated way. \n\nCheers, rocky\u003c/pre\u003e",
