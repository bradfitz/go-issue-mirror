I was trying to use\nhttp.FileServer with a vfs and faking my the http Request.URL.Path to make FileServer\nserve the virtual file I wanted.\n\nMy input URL was /ui/ and I was faking the request to the VFS for /index.html, because\nthat's the file I wanted to serve.\n\nThe FileServer then redirected me to \u0026quot;/\u0026quot;, because it was trying to strip the\nindex.html from the URL.\n\nThat's a bit weird. All other filenames work fine.\n\nI guess I can't use the filename index.html.\u003c/pre\u003e",
