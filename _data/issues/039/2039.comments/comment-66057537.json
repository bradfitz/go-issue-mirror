I tried it out in my server, and it works.\n\nBut now it exposes another problem: redirects.\n\nThe fileHandler redirects requests for /index.html to / . But since it's running under\nStripPrefix, the user really requested /static/index.html (in this case), and he should\nbe redirected to /static/ .\n\nIt's easy enough to fix on my site, since I was redirecting / to /static/index.html\nalready. I just redirected / to /static/ instead. (I really ought to eliminate the\n/static directory entirely, but that's another issue.) But I'm puzzled about how to fix\nit in the general case. Ideally, it would be nice to be able to fix redirects issued\neven by user code (not just by FileServer), but how would you do that?\n\"\"\"\u003c/pre\u003e",
