If his code was put into golang.org/x/arch/ppc64 after changing the strings from power64 to ppc64, then there are just a few other minor changes to get objump and the testcase to work on ppc64x and I can finish those if necessary.  For now if it could be put into golang.org/x/arch (not sure if that is frozen too?) that would make it easier to use and the rest could be done later for Go 1.8.",
