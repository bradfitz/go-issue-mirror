	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI'd like to be able to use GetCertificate to dynamically generate a certificate at the\ntime the request comes in (with caching on top). As is, the code always checks\nconfig.Certificates first, even if it won't be used.\n\nMy wish is:\n\n1. GetCertificate would be called even without SNI (no SNI shows up as\nClientHelloInfo.ServerName==\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, the docs already talk about this)\n\n2. config.Certificates would be looked at only if GetCertificate returns nil, nil\u003c/pre\u003e",
