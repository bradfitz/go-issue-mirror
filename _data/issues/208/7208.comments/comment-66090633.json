I'm not aware of anybody on the core Go team interested\nin working on this.  Unless somebody with a lot of time and skill steps forward, I think\nsupport is quite unlikely.\n\nIt would be much less work to add AIX support to the gccgo compiler.  I doubt it works\ntoday but I think somebody with some knowledge of the XCOFF object file format could do\nthe port without too much work.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **LongTerm**._",
