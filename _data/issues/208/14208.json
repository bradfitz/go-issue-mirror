	"body": "**What version of Go are you using (go version)?** 1.5.3\r\n\r\nWhen using godoc (or golang.org's) search with a regular expression (for example), the printed search has escaped the escape characters.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I make the following search:\r\n\r\n    func [A-Za-z0-9]+\\(\\n\r\n\r\nhttps://golang.org/search?q=func+%5BA-Za-z0-9%5D%2B%5C%28%5Cn\r\n\r\nI expected to see the following title printed:\r\n\r\n    Results for query \"func [A-Za-z0-9]+\\(\\n\"\r\n\r\nInstead this is what I saw:\r\n\r\n    Results for query \"func [A-Za-z0-9]+\\\\(\\\\n\"\r\n\r\nIt would be beneficial for me to be able to, at least, be able to copy-paste and tweak this to alter my search (without having to manually remove all escaping or make a copy before I hit search).\r\n\r\nAnother useful feature would be for my search to persist (unescaped) in the search box.",
