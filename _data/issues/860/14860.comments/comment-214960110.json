All it said was:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// worst case host, still round trips\r\n```\r\n\r\n... with no reference to a bug giving any backstory.\r\n\r\ngit blame points to e8be9a170c3044d7460a6b2c8349a723b1a21dd2 which says:\r\n\r\n\u003e   This allows mysql://a,b,c/path to continue to parse, as it did in Go 1.4 and earlier.\r\n\r\nSo if this is about breaking mysql, I don't think we break mysql with this CL, since that example didn't have an invalid port?\r\n",
