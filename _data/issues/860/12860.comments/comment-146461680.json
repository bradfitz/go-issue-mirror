Than you get errors like:\r\n```\r\ngithub.com/something/something/somefile.go:10: undefined: SomeThing\r\n```\r\nPeople report issues because they don't understand this. \r\n\r\nI tried adding this to Go sources that import C:\r\n```\r\n// +build cgo !cgo\r\n```\r\nThat doesn't work.\r\n\r\nMy current solution is to add an empty C file and at least one Go file that doesn't import C.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there could be a build directive that says that it is an error if a file is not used in the build, that overrules the implicit cgo directive, like:\r\n```\r\n// +build all\r\n```\r\n",
