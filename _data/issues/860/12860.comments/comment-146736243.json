(That build directive is also accurate; you don't want that file to build without cgo enabled.)\r\n\r\n\u003e My current solution is to add an empty C file and at least one Go file that doesn't import C.\r\n\r\nHow does that solve anything? I thought you already had Go files that don't import C in that package.",
