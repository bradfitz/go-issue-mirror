	"body": "For GCC, we are setting `-fdebug-prefix-map=$SRC_ROOT=.` dynamically for most builds, which removes it from `DW_AT_comp_dir`. Recently we landed a patch in GCC to make it not embed debug-prefix-map into `DW_AT_producer`, so this now works to achieve buildpath-independent reproducibility.\r\n\r\nYes, we're being quite strict with ourselves in trying to make things independent of the build path, but we think it's a good goal that would allow more people in practice to perform build verification.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we'd want as many people to rebuild the *same* hash as possible, so that the rest of the world (who we assume don't want to do these rebuilds) can see that 20 people built the same hash, rather than 5 people built 4 different hashes. It is indeed unclear at the moment what the \"best tradeoff\" is - we're just scratching the surface of this topic ourselves - but this particular issue seemed fairly easy to me to fix.\r\n\r\n(edit: more accurate to say `SRC_ROOT` instead of `PWD`; we set it once at the start of the build when they happen to be equal)",
