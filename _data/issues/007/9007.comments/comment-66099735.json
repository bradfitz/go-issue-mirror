Because, on further\nreflection, all the signal handlers are installed with SA_RESTART set, so the write\nshould restart, not fail.\n\nI'm afraid I can't provide you with strace since I'm not exactly experience this myself,\nbut an user does. But I believe EINTR is only possible error that would trigger this\npanic (i.e. nil or other error wouldn't skip sanity check).\u003c/pre\u003e",
