Obviously\nif you need to know in your own package you can write different files with different\nbuild tags and different initialized constants or variables. But this is rarely needed.\n\nThis is not just adding an API to access build tags. It requires recording them in the\nfirst place, and most will not be used. It's extra cost for little to no gain, and worse\nit opens up the possibility for misuse.\n\nLet's leave build tags in the build.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
