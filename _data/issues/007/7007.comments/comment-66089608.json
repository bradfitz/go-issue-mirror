Preprocessor macros are bad\nbecause they change how code is compiled based on external controls, and so code may\ncompile on one system but not another. Adding an API to access build tags is not that;\nit can only affect your code's runtime behaviour, just as runtime.GOOS can.\n\nI think it would be a useful supplement to how build constraints are currently working;\nthey only permit whole-file control when sometimes there is just a trivial little tweak\nneeded.\u003c/pre\u003e",
