I do not see anything in the documentation for Duration (or the\nfunctions that use it) that indicates it is used as a delta for wall time. If anything,\nI think changing Duration-related functions to use a monotonic clock would make it more\naccurate and less surprising with its current documentation.\n\n\u003e The real WTF here is that there are still systems that cannot keep accurate\ntime and have giant backward or forward time jumps in their real time.\n\nNot all devices have the luxury of saving the time and asking the Internet. At my\nprevious job, I worked on an embedded system that did not save time across power cycles\nbecause it was small and didn't have a battery. An external source would eventually push\na time to my device sometime after boot. The time updates would not necessarily come\nright away, and sometimes the time would jump around multiple times (and by large\nmagnitudes) depending on the kind of testing the systems guys were doing. The software\nhad to use monotonic clocks in order to be robust and not break during wall time changes.\u003c/pre\u003e",
