I think it's a serious issue and should not\nbe taken lightly.\n\nCurrently, it looks like nanotime() and now() are aliases to each other. My armchair\nlayman's thought is to keep now() functionally the same (i.e. it returns wall time) and\nhave nanotime() use a monotonic clock instead. I'd try it myself except that the\nrelevant bits are in assembly and I haven't wrapped my head around it yet.\n\nConsidering two core devs have called this issue \"Unfortunate\", I must be missing\nsomething though.\u003c/pre\u003e",
