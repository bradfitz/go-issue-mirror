If you want to blink a window every\nsecond, check email every minute, or timeout idle tcp connection after 5 min, then you\npretty much do not care about the output of:\n\nt := time.Now()\ntime.Sleep(10*time.Minute)\nfmt.Println(time.Since(t))\n\nYou just want timers against monotonic time.\nIn the end, the following code can work perfectly reasonably (well, hibernation aside):\n\nt := time.MonoNow()\ntime.MonoSleep(10*time.Minute)\nfmt.Println(time.MonoSince(t))\n\nCurrently we do strange wtfs like timing out tcp connections based on real time...\u003c/pre\u003e",
