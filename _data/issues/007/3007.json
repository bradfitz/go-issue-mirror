I suspect that someone intended to fix this at some point because there\nis an unused `UTFmax' constant floating around in there. In any case, I have attached a\npatch for this. Please consider it.\n\n$ hg identify \n52ba9506bd99 weekly/weekly.2012-02-07\n$\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3007/0/yacc.patch\"\u003eyacc.patch\u003c/a\u003e (973 bytes)",
