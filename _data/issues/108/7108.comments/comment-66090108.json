I think at the moment the go tool skips\ngenerating the test runner if there are no _test files. It sounds like you are\nsuggesting that the go tool should always build the test runner, or execute an\nunconditional go build in each package.\n\nThere would probably have to be some more restrictions. ie, we shouldn't attempt to\nbuild empty directories, or directories that contain no .go files.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
