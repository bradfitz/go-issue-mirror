E.g., in AssignStmt, it counts from 0 to len(Lhs)+len(Rhs)-1.\r\n\r\nI've had cases where I want to be able to walk up the AST more than one Node, so I maintain a slice of (Parent, Index) tuples.\r\n\r\nAside: Index technically isn't necessary, and Java's Compiler API omits it from com.sun.source.util.TreePath.  But I think it's handy to have.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand what addr's dynamic type will be from the description.  I'm guessing though that if I'm visiting a \\*ast.Ident, then it could be either a \\*\\*ast.Ident (e.g., the name for a ValueSpec) or \\*ast.Expr (e.g., an identifier in an expression context)?",
