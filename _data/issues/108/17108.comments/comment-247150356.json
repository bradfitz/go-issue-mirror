The reflect-based implementations in gofmt (and eg) is fearsomely complex, and there are other times I have wanted to use this function.\r\n\r\nThe index is not enough to uniquely identify a subtree of a node.  For example, ast.CaseClause contains two slices of Nodes, and ast.BinOp contains two Exprs.  I think we need to identify the field too.  The most obvious way to do that is by its name.  Field numbers, or field offsets, might be marginally more efficient, but would certainly be harder to read, and I'm users would thank us for choosing strings when they're debugging.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure you need the index (or index + field name) in the Apply function, only in ApplyFunc.\r\n\r\n",
