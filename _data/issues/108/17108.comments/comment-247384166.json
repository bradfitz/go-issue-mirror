Examples of how I use a single index to identify child nodes:\r\n  - To find the i'th child of a CallExpr: i==0 means Fun, and otherwise you want Args[i-1].\r\n  - To find the i'th child of an AssignStmt, i\u003clen(Lhs) means Lhs[i], and otherwise you want Rhs[i-len(Lhs)].\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not opposed to field names.",
