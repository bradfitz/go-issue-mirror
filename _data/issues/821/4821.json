That seems like too many. Are they left over from\nearlier tests? Are things not being cleaned up correctly?\n\nFull goroutine dump attached.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4821/0/httpcrash.txt\"\u003ehttpcrash.txt\u003c/a\u003e (85003 bytes)",
