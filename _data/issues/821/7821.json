I am uncertain what exactly counts as\nan 'element'.\n\nMy issue is that there's probably a good reason for the current behavior and that reason\nshould be added to the documentation. If there is not a good reason for it, the behavior\nshould change.\n\nProvided with the former I am happy to add the verbiage explaining why, and lacking that\nI am happy to submit a patch to add prefix to the first line.\u003c/pre\u003e",
