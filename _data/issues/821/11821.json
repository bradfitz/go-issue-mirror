	"body": "Running `go get -u` for an app with a decent number of dependencies can be extremely slow from a location with high latency to GitHub (and other code hosts, too -- it's even worse when there are redirects involved). For example, from my machine in Sydney the following command takes almost 90 seconds to download 18 repos:\r\n\r\n    go get -v -u -t github.com/googlecloudplatform/gcsfuse/...\r\n\r\nThis is in stark contrast to general use of the `go` command, which is otherwise pleasantly fast.\r\n\r\nI notice that downloads happen serially. It seems like `go get` could benefit greatly from doing them concurrently. Are there any major obstacles to doing so?",
