The alternative--lots of \nusually unnecessary zeroing--has a definite performance\ncost too.\n\nI'm marking this LongTerm instead of WontFix so that we\ncan revisit the issue once the new garbage collector is\nready, but I don't expect to have a solution to this.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **LongTerm**._",
