	"body": "The description of Get function in net/http package says that \"Get issues a GET to the specified URL.\" So the question here is what's URL? Is that a subset of URIs described in RFC 3986? If so, the port subcomponent of authority must be decimal digits.\r\n```\r\nport = *DIGIT\r\n```\r\nOtherwise I have no strong opinions. I'm fine it becomes part of service discovery feature based on DNS or other fancy techniques. In that case it would look like scheme names of URI:\r\n```\r\nport = *( ALPHA / DIGIT / \"+\" / \"-\" / \".\" )\r\n```",
