Media feels like a directory with nothing but other packages, and it would be confusing to me for the image package to live outside this directory if it existed.\r\n\r\nFWIW, the existing golang.org/x/image, golang.org/x/net, golang.org/x/sys and golang.org/x/text directories are nothing but other packages. There may be other examples. I didn't do an exhaustive search.",
