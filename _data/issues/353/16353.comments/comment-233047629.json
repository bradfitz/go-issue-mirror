	"body": "@rakyll Agreed with all the above points and concerns. My only caveat would be possibly discussing a package for _all_ media decoders and parsers? Though perhaps limiting scope to just audio with structure for other elements would be useful. \r\n\r\nAlso agreed with renaming.\r\n\r\nWe have also just open sourced our [go mpegts parser](https://github.com/Comcast/gots). This, other than some overly brief documentation, should match the go style guide. The mobile audio proposal includes HLS, which is generally carried in TS so I suspect it may be of some use for that as well.",
