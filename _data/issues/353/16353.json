	"body": "# The Proposal\r\nGolang has an `x/image` \"extension\" library. Adding an `x/media` package for parsing video and audio transports (and possibly codecs) seems a logical extension. Interacting with media is an extremely common task today, having this as part of the standard library would probably be beneficial for all.\r\n\r\n# Proposed Implementation\r\nWe at Comcast have recently open sourced our [aac parser](https://github.com/Comcast/gaad). We also are looking to open source our parsers for h.264, h.265, DD, DD+, and MPEG2-TS. We would like to work with the go community to make them available in a golang extensions package. These parsers are currently only for the framing and transports, not the actual decoding.\r\n\r\n## Similar Items\r\nIt appears the `x/image` has some ability to deal with the vp8 codec, but doesn't appear to deal with framing of any sort.",
