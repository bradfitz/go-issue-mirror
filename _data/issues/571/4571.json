However, getTitle() isn't\nintroduced until the section on \u0026quot;validation\u0026quot;, at which point the learner is\ninstructed to add it to viewHandler().\n\nHope this is helpful and not-pestering. Thanks very much for all of youall's help and\nwork on this project.  It's been great fun learning go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
