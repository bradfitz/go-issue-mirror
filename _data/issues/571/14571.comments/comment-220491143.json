	"body": "@ianlancetaylor The race here isn't about receiving two signals and losing one of them.  The problem is that if os/signal.Stop grabs handlers.Lock, and then we receive a SIGINT before os/signal.Stop is able to call disableSignal(SIGINT), then we've accepted that signal instead of letting the default OS behavior exuecute.  But because we're holding handlers.Lock (and possibly have already deregistered c), we prevent the os/signal.loop goroutine from calling os/signal.process to dispatch the signal to c.",
