Sending a signal to a process sets a bit.  When the process checks that bit, it takes some action.  Sending two signals to a process simultaneously just sets that bit twice.  If the process doesn't check the bit between the two signal sends, then it will only receive one signal.\r\n\r\nI'm not completely sure but I suspect that is what is happening with this program.",
