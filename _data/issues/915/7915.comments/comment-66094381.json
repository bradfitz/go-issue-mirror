'go build' and 'go install' have nothing to work with. I can fix the error to be\nlike:\n\ngo install github.com/fudanchii/A/c: no buildable Go source files in\n/Users/rsc/g/src/github.com/fudanchii/A/c\n\nI am not sure there's much more to do. It seems like a mistake for go install to\nsilently do nothing for a directory it has been asked to work on. The ... cannot exclude\nthese 'test-only' packages because then 'go test ./...' doesn't work. \n\nIt has never been our intent to support package directories that contain only tests.\nIt's an interesting use case but it's not planned for in the tool and it is difficult to\nsupport. But we'll make the error better.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
