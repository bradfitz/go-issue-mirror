	"body": "Oracle takes a list of arguments that [set the analysis scope](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SLk36YRjjMgKqe490mSRzOPYEDe0Y_WQNRv-EiFYUyw/view#heading=h.nwso96pj07q8). If a given argument (e.g. `github.com/example/project`) does not have any immediate source files, it is excluded from the analysis. However, many projects have sub-packages that do have main or test files, and enumerating these manually to oracle is difficult to manage. The user should have some way of indicating to oracle that a given path should be treated recursively and searched for any sub-packages that may have main or test files. In other words, given `github.com/example/project` which only has two sub-projects `github.com/example/project/subproject-one` and `github.com/example/project/subproject-two` which have main and/or test files, both should be included in the analysis scope.\r\n\r\nThis could be indicated with a command-line parameter (\"includes packages recursively in scope\") or as part of the path itself (`github.com/example/project/...`).",
