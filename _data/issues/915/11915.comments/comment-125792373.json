We could have a flag to specify it. But that would defeat the primary advantage of gofmt of producing one uniform style. There's no good answer to setting a limit.\r\n\r\nIt's much better to leave judgement to authors, programs, etc. that generate Go code, and respect the original input in that respect.\r\n\r\nWill not change.\r\n",
