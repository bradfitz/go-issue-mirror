But mksyscall_windows.go handle those as same. So the code made by mksyscall_windows.go are generated as [pkgStd](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/syscall/mksyscall_windows.go#L727) because [IsStdRepo](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/syscall/mksyscall_windows.go#L698) [doesn't check](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/syscall/mksyscall_windows.go#L711) trailing path separator as delimiter.\r\nIf I have last backslash in GOPATH and GOROOT, it will works fine. But official [installation instruction](https://golang.org/doc/install#tarball_non_standard) doesn't have trailing slash/backslash in the environment variables.",
