	"body": "FTR, if we implemented errors.errorString as a simple\nalias of string, then it will be possible to have a const\nerrors.errorString. (You still can't create a constant\nfrom errors.New() though, because one can't use a\nfunction call to initialize a constant.)\n\nHowever, that will also allow you to assign an arbitrary\nstring to such an error, and that's one of the reason\nerrors.errorString is a struct around a string. And to\nspeed up comparison, errors.New() returns a pointer\nto errorString rather than errorString itself.\n",
