So I thought you are pointing to:\r\n```\r\nFor UDP sockets you get an EPOLLOUT event when the send operation completes, whereas with UNIX domain sockets you get an EPOLLOUT event when the data has been read by the peer. And finally, with UNIX pipes you get an event when the send operation completes and another event when the data is read by the peer.\r\n```\r\nThus my reply -- getting one or two notifications is irrelevant for netpoller.\r\n\r\nIs there a description as to why/when zillions of notifications happen?",
