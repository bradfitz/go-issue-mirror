If you believe that your issue is a bug on language spec. or standard library/commands, please describe the following:\r\n```\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n(already answered, skip)\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\n(already answered, skip)\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n```\r\nIn your case, the recipe must be a complete history of commands. Thanks. ",
