In fact, if you use those scripts and\ndo the `buildpkg windows 386` as it suggests, you will have a functioning cross compiler\nfor that target. If you then do `buildpkg linux 386`, you will have a functioning\nlinux/386 cross-compiler, but it breaks the windows/386 cross compiler in the process.\n\nThe problem stems from the fact that the cross compilers rely on some generated header\nfiles that are cleaned up on subsequent builds and those only available for the last\ngenerated cross compiler.\u003c/pre\u003e",
