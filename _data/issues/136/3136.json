Attempt to use first cross compiler.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nI expect to see a compiled binary for the target of the cross compiler.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nOne of a few different errors stemming from missing generated files that seem to be\ncleaned up before each build, and thus not available for generated cross compilers after\nsubsequent other compiler builds.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g/8g.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n96bd78e7d35e weekly/weekly.2012-02-22\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nBasically, I'm using this gma_setup() and gma()\n(\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/colemickens/scripts/blob/master/dotfiles/_zshrc_golang)\"\u003ehttps://github.com/colemickens/scripts/blob/master/dotfiles/_zshrc_golang)\u003c/a\u003e to build\ncross compilers and then utilize them to build my project(s). The cross-compiler that I\nbuild last works without error, but depending on the order I build them in, earlier\ncross compilers don't work.\n\nFor example, that script currently builds linux/386, then linux/amd64, then windows/386.\nThe build for windows/386 completes fine, but I get the following error when building my\nproject for linux/386:\n\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=386\n# runtime\n../../../go/src/pkg/runtime/asm_386.s:6 8a: No such file or directory: zasm_GOOS_GOARCH.h\n\nIf I change the order and build the linux/386 cross compiler last, I get the following\nerrors:\n\nGOOS=windows GOARCH=386\n# runtime\n../../../go/src/pkg/runtime/extern.go:135: undefined: theGoos\n../../../go/src/pkg/runtime/extern.go:135: cannot use theGoos as type string in const\ninitializer\u003c/pre\u003e",
