You can't just run \"go test -buildmode=shared std\" though because -buildmode=shared doesn't make an executable. I guess it would make sense to build a minimal libruntime.so and run tests for all std library things apart from runtime (you can't really say go test -linkshared foo when foo is built into a shared library).\r\n\r\nRunning go -test -buildmode=pie would be useful.\r\n\r\nSomething like https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/16343/ would be nice too.",
