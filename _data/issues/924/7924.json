However, this is contradicted by the next paragraph\nwhich says that short variable declarations are distinguished from regular variable\ndeclarations in that they alone can redeclare variables.\n\nIt may be better to reword this section to say a short variable declaration \u0026quot;is\nsimilar to a regular variable declaration with initializer expressions but no types,\nexcept that it may redeclare variables in the same block providing it declares at least\none new, non-blank variable\u0026quot;. (The definition of redeclaration should also continue\nto be provided separately.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
