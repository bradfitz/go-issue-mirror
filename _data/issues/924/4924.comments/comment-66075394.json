I run all the tests\nin $GOROOT/test and I get this output:\n\nswitch.go:400: cannot fallthrough final case in switch\n\nwhich is the error string I am throwing when a fallthrough is detected in the final\ncase. The error is correct, but I am not sure how to proceed with the test file itself.\nAs of now, it completely fails to compile, as it should, however, it seems like a bad\nidea to simply remove the code entirely to make it build.\n\nMy question, then: is it possible for me to have the test expect this statement to fail\nto compile? What would be the proper way to proceed and still have test coverage for\nthis particular case?\n\nThanks!\u003c/pre\u003e",
