	"body": "by **atbaig2002**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI am planning to use go for a high performance application.\nOne of the main reason why we chose go over other languages is performance. As a\ncryptographer and security professional, the very first I tend to do compare the speed\nof RSA signing operations. I was disappointed to see that RSA256 signing operation was 4\ntimes slower than C implementation in openssl. I hope the fix would come soon.   \n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Perform the signing operation \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa/#SignPKCS1v15\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa/#SignPKCS1v15\u003c/a\u003e \n2.openssl speed rsa2048\n3.you will notice a significant difference.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\ncomparable speed\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nslower\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\ngo\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nLinux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\n1.2\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
