	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Look at doc/effective_go.html  doc/effective_go.tmpl\n2. Look at the section on \u0026quot;The init function\u0026quot;\n3. It says that goroutines are not executed during init\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nI expect that the doc does one of the following:\n- not mention anything about goroutines, OR\n- make clear that goroutines can be executed during init.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nIt says that a restriction of init function is that \ngoroutines are not executed during init\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n5c664f190e4e+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI would do a CL but not sure how you want to spin it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
