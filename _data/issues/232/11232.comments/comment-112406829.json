Build steps with most software tends to be painful and under documented (e.g. type the magic command and *everything* just works) and I say this after having a lot of build experience. I really tried to scour the web before posting this here. This issue with Mac could be better documented. Having an issue here is one step in that direction.\r\n\r\nFor language issues that I encounter as beginner, sure I will check stackoverflow/mailing list and post them to one of those places.",
