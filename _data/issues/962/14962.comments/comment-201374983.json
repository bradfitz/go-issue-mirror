	"body": "I fixed this by accident in 4d92041. The linker aligns the start of most symbols, but not go.string.* symbols. With 4d92041, the type data is written into an aligned symbol.\r\n\r\nDo you think that's enough here, or should I modify the code to defend against future unaligned symbols? I don't see it being very likely, in general the .type.* symbols are full of pointers so it's not safe for the linker to pack them. And there aren't very many of these.",
