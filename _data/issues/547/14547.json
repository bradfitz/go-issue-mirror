	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\u003e ~~~\r\n\u003e go version go1.6 linux/amd64\r\n\u003e ~~~\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\u003e ~~~\r\n\u003e GOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\n\u003e GOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\n\u003e GOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\n\u003e GOOS=\"linux\"\r\n\u003e ~~~\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\u003e **`go list -f '{{ context.GOPATH }}'`**\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\u003e Something along the lines of `go env | grep GOPATH`\r\n\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\u003e Nothing was returned.\r\n\r\n### Investigation\r\n\r\nI believe this to be the problem:\r\n\r\nThe `Context` struct for the template is constructed in [context.go#L24](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/3cb870d47b5611465c46c6a6512b7f059584c66f/src/cmd/go/context.go#L24) and assigned in [list.go#L160](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/3cb870d47b5611465c46c6a6512b7f059584c66f/src/cmd/go/list.go#L160), but the field GOPATH doesn't seem to be assigned.\r\n\r\nI'm not knownledgeable enough to know if this has some meaning, but it seems like a bug.",
