I didn't saw the error\nmsg.\n\nThe template stops on template.go:line 722 : ie var name unfound (normal nil has no\nfield) and parent is nil \n(normal, nil is nil ;) ).\nSo i stops emitting a \"name not found: %s\" error.\n\nimho, the repeated section should not iterate on nil value.\u003c/pre\u003e",
