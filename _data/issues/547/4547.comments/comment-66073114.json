A zero byte is nothing special (at runtime\nwithin a string, not in Go source code). It is legal to use strings for general binary\ndata (just any non UTF-8 necoding as well). Of course then string handling functions may\nnot work. But if `TrimSpace()` should trim also zero bytes then it should have be\ninstead named `TrimSpaceAndzeros` or something like that.\n\nIMO \"Working as intended\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
