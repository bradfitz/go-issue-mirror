The problem is save_g doesn't expect anyone to make any BL\ncalls and hasn't setup its own link register properly so when runtime.tls_read_fallback\nreturns the LR points to save_g, not save_g's caller so the RET at the end of the\nfunction turns into an infinite loop.\n\nThis fix is only a proof of concept, I think the real fix should go into liblink as its\nMRC substitution is not as transparent as expected.\n\nLGTM=rsc\nR=rsc, minux\nCC=golang-codereviews\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/143050043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/143050043\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
