	"body": "One symptom:\r\nThe behavior of `GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP=$HOME/go1.5-bootstrap ./make.bash` and\r\n`GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP=$HOME/go1.5-bootstrap/ ./make.bash` are vastly different\r\neven though the only difference is just a trailing slash added to GOROOT.\r\n($HOME/go1.5-bootstrap is a Go 1.5 installation)\r\n\r\nThe first will not rebuild std in $GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP, however, the later will.\r\n\r\nAn easier repro:\r\n```\r\n$ goroot=`go env GOROOT`\r\n$ cd $goroot/src; ./make.bash # a fresh build\r\n$ GOROOT=$goroot go build -v ../test/helloworld.go # it only build helloworld.go\r\n$ GOROOT=$goroot/ go build -v ../test/helloworld.go # it will recompile runtime\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior suggests that some paths that get included in the buildid hash\r\nare not properly Cleaned.",
