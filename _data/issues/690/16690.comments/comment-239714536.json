The bug was that a negative index was being passed in to the precomputed Folds table(thereby causing the index out of bounds panic) look up due to new condition\r\n```go\r\nif int(r) \u003c len(asciiFold) {\r\n   return rune(asciiFold[r])\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nthat should be us first checking if negative\r\n```go\r\nif r \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 int(r) \u003c len(asciiFold) {\r\n   return rune(asciiFold[r])\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand this way only the precomputed values will benefit from this cache hit, other values(negative values included) will take the same code path as they were before that change/preGo1.7.\r\n\r\nIf we deem that the CL needs to go out ASAP since a new release is coming up, perhaps anyone of us can spin up/take over it and give the credit to @hirochachacha for the find/patch?",
