	"body": "Just a minor addition: stats.Pause doesn't accurately reflect the pause times of concurrent GCs right now, though it will be accurate for the forced STW GC that this test program is doing. Currently the only way to get accurate pause times for concurrent GCs is setting GODEBUG=gctrace=1 (which is what @RLH did). The issue with GCStats.Pause is #10323.\r\n\r\nPerhaps runtime.GC needs documentation explaining that it does a STW GC?",
