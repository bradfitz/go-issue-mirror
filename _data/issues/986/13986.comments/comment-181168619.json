A common vocabulary of attributes for this tag could be recognized by each of these packages, and attributes defined in a json/xml/etc tag would take precedence.\r\n\r\nOne thing that json and xml do not agree on are naming conventions -- if you used a single string to define tag/field names for both, then one or the other would perhaps be unconventional.",
