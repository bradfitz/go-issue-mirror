There's nothing special about proxies here, other than\nthat once \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/7759\"\u003eissue #7759\u003c/a\u003e is fixed, httputil.ReverseProxy should perhaps use it.\n\nCustom Status Text is marginally useful and marginally harmful: it shouldn't matter.\nCorrect implementations should not be reading like humans. \"The Reason-Phrase is\nintended to give a short textual description of the Status-Code. The Status-Code is\nintended for use by automata and the Reason-Phrase is intended for the human user. The\nclient is not required to examine or display the Reason- Phrase.\" Until I'm hear a\nreally great reason, I'd prefer to not clutter up net/http.\n\nPlease file a separate bug just about omitting Content-Type in responses.\n\nI won't be adding something so large of an interface as Responder, though. It overlaps\ntoo much with other stuff and would be confusing, and hard to support over time.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
