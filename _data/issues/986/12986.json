	"body": "The documentation for `http.ResponseWriter` specifies certain behaviors for the `Header() Header` and the ` Write([]byte) (int, error)` functions that are not being implemented by `httptest.ResponseRecorder` currently. Specifically -\r\n\r\n- in `Write()` If the Header does not contain a Content-Type line, Write adds a Content-Type set to the result of passing the initial 512 bytes of written data to DetectContentType.\r\n- Changing the header after a call to WriteHeader (or Write) has no effect unless the modified headers were declared as trailers by setting the \"Trailer\" header before the call to WriteHeader\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue when looking for Content-Type header from ResponseRecorder and looking at the code for ResponseRecorder, did not see an implementation for the spec.",
