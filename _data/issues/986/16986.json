	"body": "### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo1.6.3.windows-386.msi\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n```\r\nset GOROOT=C:\\Program Files\\Go\r\nset GOTOOLDIR=C:\\Program Files\\Go\\pkg\\tool\\windows_386\r\nset GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\nRun installer `go1.6.3.windows-386.msi`, it didn't detect existing 1.6.2 installation, so I thought that maybe it is a feature to run multiple versions of Go side by side. Pointed it to existing `C:\\Program Files\\Go` installation.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nExpected it at least to warn about non-empty directory, then tell me what is he going to do with it:\r\n\r\n1. remove\r\n2. blend its files inside\r\n3. fail\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\nI see request for administration privileges to continue installation.\r\n",
