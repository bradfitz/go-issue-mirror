Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. ./make.bash fails if hg is not installed\n2. ./make.bash will silently fail versioning if hg is installed and there is no .hg tree\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nlinux\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nd5785050f61d (release-branch.r59) release/release.r59\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI understand hg is the defacto standard for gaining the hg source tree. however there\nmust be a better way to gain version without having a hard build dependancy on hg? I\nthought something like a $Id tag might be a solution for this one task? Or possible it\nwould be better to start having release tarballs for release tags only?\u003c/pre\u003e",
