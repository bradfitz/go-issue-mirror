It's such an awful format.  The only reason\nanyone takes it seriously is you have to use it to decode\nSSL certificates, and that's all the package is intended for.\n\nJSON and ASN.1 are different too: ASN.1 is good at binary\nblobs of data while that's arguably JSON's one weakness.\nEven so, I think you're right that it would be good to use\nthe same signature for Marshal and Unmarshal in both,\nif only to set a good precedent for future packages.\nI'll update package asn1.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Started**._",
