This error comes from the\nguessKind() method in src/cmd/cgo/gcc.go and appears to have started when clang was made\nthe default CC for darwin. Testing this with CC=gcc seems to confirm this (builds\nsuccessfully). I have not tested this with any other versions of clang or on linux, but\nit looks like guessKind() is a very GCC specific routine that will need to be adapted to\nsupport other compilers like clang, but I have limited knowledge on this.\n\nNot sure whether or not to submit an actual issue as non-gcc support seemed to be a work\nin progress, but posted here for your awareness.\n\n$ clang -v\nApple LLVM version 4.2 (clang-425.0.28) (based on LLVM 3.2svn)\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin12.4.0\nThread model: posix\u003c/pre\u003e",
