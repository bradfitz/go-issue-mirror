What is performance depending on number of cores?\r\n\r\n\u003e iowait reaches 20% due to memory ping-pong across CPU cores inside siftupTimer and siftdownTimer functions in runtime/time.go.\r\n\r\nI don't understand relation between iowait and memory ping-pong? iowait if waiting for IO, like hard drive, memory accesses are not IO.\r\n\r\nHow exactly does profile look?\r\n\r\n\u003e Each connection has read and write deadlines set via net.Conn.SetReadDeadline and net.Conn.SetWriteDeadline.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to change it to SetDeadline? It would setup 1 timer instead of 2.",
