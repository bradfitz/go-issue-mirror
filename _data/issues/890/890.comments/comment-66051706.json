I will check,\nbut I am fairly certain that \"firewall\" is not an issue.  The firewall between internal\nnetwork and the wider Internet cannot be an issue as the build works using Ubuntu Lucid\non the same machine connected in an identical way.  The machine specific firewall could\nbe a factor but I am confident that the set up for Ubuntu Lucid and Debian Squeeze is\nthe same.  I will check, but I don't think this is an issue.\n\nInvestigating this issue stems from trying to write applications using networking.  The\napplication runs fine on Ubuntu Lucid, but fails on Debian Testing with \"network\nunreachable\" arising from the DialHTTP calls.  My current hypothesis is that if the\nabove problem with the Go build is resolved, the problem with my application will get\nsolved.  If not I can then put forward a test case.  There seems no point in putting\nforward a test case just now because of the test fails in the Go build.\u003c/pre\u003e",
