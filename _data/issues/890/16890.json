	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n```\r\ngo version go1.7 darwin/amd64\r\n```\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n```\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"darwin\"\r\nGOOS=\"darwin\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/Users/jeffwilliams/go\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.7/libexec\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.7/libexec/pkg/tool/darwin_amd64\"\r\nCC=\"clang\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fno-caret-diagnostics -Qunused-arguments -fmessage-length=0 -fdebug-prefix-map=/var/folders/jc/ctl0fvhs34v21m_hg1z3w0zh0000gp/T/go-build379181819=/tmp/go-build -gno-record-gcc-switches -fno-common\"\r\nCXX=\"clang++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nOne unreadable dir in GOPATH will cause the walk to fail and ignore all directories after that point, with a confusing message like:\r\n```\r\n2016/08/26 15:39:24 goimports: scanning directory /Users/jeffwilliams/go/src: permission denied\r\n```\r\nIn this case, it was a test dir with permissions 0000:\r\n```\r\n/Users/jeffwilliams/go/src/github.com/wherethebitsroam/cloudcp/test/fred/dave\r\n```\r\nAdmittedly, moving this test content into testdata where it should have been fixed the problem. But this is not very obvious given the error.\r\n\r\nThe relevant code was golang.org/x/tools/imports/fastwalk_unix.go:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfd, err := syscall.Open(dirName, 0, 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\ngoimports to skip the directory with permission denied. Or at least give an error with the directory which was the problem.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\ngoimports failed to insert the imports for known packages in the file being processed.\r\n",
