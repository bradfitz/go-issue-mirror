This would mean adding nine new\nfunctions, taking timeouts.\n\nTo understand your motivation for wanting this, were you actually hitting problems with\nthe number of fds or threads for the DNS/cgo calls?\n\nAnd which OS? On Linux at least we could use getaddrinfo_a (see\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.imperialviolet.org/2005/06/01/asynchronous-dns-lookups-with-glibc.html\"\u003ehttp://www.imperialviolet.org/2005/06/01/asynchronous-dns-lookups-with-glibc.html\u003c/a\u003e and\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/getaddrinfo_a.3.html)\"\u003ehttp://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/getaddrinfo_a.3.html)\u003c/a\u003e but even\nthat API doesn't really seem to do timeouts efficiently, probably because the underlying\nNSS / resolver(3) mechanisms don't really support timeouts.\n\nYour best bet probably is to not use the system's DNS facilities and use a pure Go DNS\nresolver (maybe \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/miekg/dns\"\u003ehttps://github.com/miekg/dns\u003c/a\u003e, which seems popular), where you'll have\nmore control.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-someday**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
