	"body": "Hi guys!\r\nI'm a noob but totally available to fix this issue. Could you please let me know whether I need to mark myself as the assignee (and how), so that we can avoid duplicate work? Or do you follow a different path?\r\nFor the fix: ideally we could use all three strategies proposed by Jeff. Using option 3 (strict mode) during the import process would let the user decide if the issue is a severe one or can be ignored.\r\nFor option 1 (skip \u0026 silent) I'd rather give a warning message instead. That would be useful while investigating a build-automation log. Hiding such an error could be very painful to debug.",
