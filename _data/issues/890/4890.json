This would be useful when the user wants to control DNS\nlookups at a finer grained level separate from connections and requests. \n\nThere is a lookupHostDeadline function in net/lookup.go, but it is not exposed to the\nuser.\n\nlookupHostDeadline has a TODO inside it to bring the deadlining down into the name\nresolution functions themselves, so solving this issue could involve solving that. Even\nan exposed API with the TODO in place would allow users to benefit from future fixes.\n\nThis is related to the now closed \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/2631\"\u003eissue #2631\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/pre\u003e",
