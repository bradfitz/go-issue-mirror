	"body": "Go is almost perfect. Working with Go daily for 6 months, this is a typical pattern that we use all the time and would make LOTS of programmers super happy\r\n\r\nHaving\r\n\r\ntype A struct {\r\n   name string\r\n}\r\n\r\ngoing from []A to the slice of the names, I have to write:\r\n \r\n    var objs []A\r\n    ...\r\n    names := make([]string, 0, len(objs))\r\n    for _, obj := range objs {\r\n      names = append(names, obj.name)\r\n   }\r\n\r\nwhen we could just have \r\n\r\n    names := []string[obj.name for _, obj := range objs]\r\n\r\nor some similar syntax\r\n\r\nThanks for taking this into consideration!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.7.1\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nOS X, amd64\r\n",
