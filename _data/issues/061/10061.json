	"body": "Looking at the source, os.Rename will always return a LinkError if it returns an error, however the documentation does NOT state that behaviour.\r\n\r\nIf it's intended to be a reliable feature of this function, it should be in the docstring, in the same way that os.Create and os.Stat return PathError. Otherwise, I feel that I need to manually ensure that the information provided by LinkError is logged separately, in case future implementations of the os.Rename function don't return the details of the renamed files in the error message.",
