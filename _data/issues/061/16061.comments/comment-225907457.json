	"body": "Looks like the SSA code does a bunch of spilling to the stack where the legacy compiler doesn't.  The divide instructions require values in specific registers.  Given two subsequent divide instructions, the result of the first needs to be moved somewhere else before the second is issued.  SSA uses a stack slot for that, whereas the legacy compiler uses a register.\r\nThis will be a bit tricky to fix, but it is possible.  1.8 milestone sounds right.",
