Not all programs request elevated rights,\nthus Windows sees that it is probably an installer, thus it asks the\nuser, \"Is it OK for this program to change your computer?\" and if they\nanswer yes, then it elevates the rights given to the program to that\nof an administrator.\n\nIf, however, you tell Windows that this program does not require\nelevated rights (what the .manifest file does), then Windows does not\nbother asking the user NOR does it give the program elevated rights.\nSo, nothing is circumvented. You are just helping Windows understand\nyour programs intentions. Including the .manifest does not give your\napplication elevated rights w/o asking the user. The names on the\n\"black\" list are install, setup and update.\n\nNow... with that said, I am in agreement that if the name is changing\nin a few months then nothing should be done right now. In regards to\ndocumentation, you should not instruct someone to turn off UAC. It has\nhuge benefits in system safety. If you are going to do anything with\ndocumentation I would state that there is a known problem with the\nnaming of goinstall on Windows machines where UAC is enabled (the\ndefault, BTW). To get around these problems rename the executable to\ngoinst.exe or something to that effect.\u003c/pre\u003e",
