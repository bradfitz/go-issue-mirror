The fact that naming program goinstall.exe put you on\nthe \"black\" list seems wrong to me. Even worse, you could circumvent the system by\nattaching bit of xml data to your exe file. I believe goinstall.exe users would have to\nbe smart enough to be able to switch \"UAC Architecture\" off, if so desired.\n\nIn my mind, maybe some documentation in goinstall documentation should do the trick. But\nI live in a \"real world\" \u0026lt;g\u0026gt;, I'm happy to accept whatever solution there is to\nit. \n\nRuss, what do you say?\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
