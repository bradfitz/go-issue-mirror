I hit different problem:\n\nC:\\\u003egoinstall github.com/dchest/gotweet/src\ngoinstall: github.com/dchest/gotweet/src: mkdir c:\\a\\src\\pkg\\github.com\\dchest\\: The\nsystem cannot find the path specified.\n\nC:\\\u003e\n\nIt seems os.Mkdir only handles '/' path delimiters, but not '\\'.\n\nPerhaps you have some ideas how to reproduce your problem. Perhaps you can put\nfmt.Printf() statements inside goinstall to see where it fails and why. Thank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
