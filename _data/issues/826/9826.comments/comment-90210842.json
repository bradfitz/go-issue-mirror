Then on the line\r\n\r\n`w := _W - int(shift)`\r\n\r\n`w` is set to `0` `(64 - 64)`, so the code inside the loop on line 921 is never ran. Since `z` (the result) was set to `x` (on line 895) and never changed  the function returns `x` (5 in the example) instead of `x mod m`.\r\n\r\nPatch: https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/8409",
