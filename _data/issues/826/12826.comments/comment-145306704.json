Actually, I think\nthat's the only way to go, because we don't want to\nlose progress even if the test binary panics in midway.\n\nEven if adding -json is hard, if we intended to add -json\neventually, I don't think we should add more redundant\nmechanisms now. This is different from the go list case\nbecause go list are normally used by shell scripts so\nhaving a -f flag in addition to -json makes sense.\n",
