To\nenable x11 forwarding, the server initiates a channel open message. However, most of the\ninternal functions used to open channels and to send messages are private. This makes\ncrypto/ssh unusable for this purpose.\n\nIs it reasonable to export more functions so that users can create custom channels (not\njust x11 channels)?\u003c/pre\u003e",
