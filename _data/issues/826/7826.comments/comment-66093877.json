(please check contents of a.txt) What \"more\" and \"type\" commands do with it is a\ndifferent matter altogether. I don't see how this has anything to do with Go.\n\nI can see how things \"are not nice\". But I don't see how we can improve the situation.\nPerhaps you have some suggestions.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
