	"body": "I've built golang from master with the patches from issue 11184 to get external linking to work with ppc64le.  That seems to work well on ppc64le with external linking and cgo.\r\n\r\nIn cmd/dist/build.go, linux/ppc64le is in the cgoEnabled map but linux/ppc64 is not.  So the build of golang with the latest patches on ppc64 does not quite work with cgo.\r\n\r\nIf I build the golang toolchain on ppc64 with CGO_ENABLED=1, I first get this error:\r\n\r\ncannot use dynamic imports with -d flag\r\n\r\nI made a change to cmd/link/internal/ppc64/obj.go to get rid of this message, but then hit this error:\r\n/home/boger/golang/gitsrc/latest/go/pkg/linux_ppc64/net.a(_all.o): unknown relocation type 51; compiled without -fpic?\r\n......\r\nruntime/cgo(.opd): unexpected relocation type 307\r\n.......\r\nand then too many errors\r\n\r\nI can see that relocation type 51 is R_PPC64_TOC and that is not handled by the code.  I tried adding those defines but not sure what should be generated for this relocation type.  If there are suggestions on what to do I can try them out.",
