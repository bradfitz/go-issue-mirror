There are no races here. And I see no way that a reference to github.com/calmh/xdr could be resolved using the second GOPATH entry. Do you perhaps have some kind of cron script or other background builds running? The errors you got from the linker would make sense if maybe something was reinstalling the package files underfoot.\r\n",
