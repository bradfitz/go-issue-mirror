I incorporated their code names and parts of their description in the proposal. Multiple classifications are ok and also intended. In some cases they make no sense, but that can be enforced by the provided IsFoo-functions. Distinct error taxonomy is much harder than just suggesting error handling strategies.\r\n\r\nTo define what common errors exist, just ask yourself and your buddies which kinds of errors they built error handling for in their programs in the last few years.\r\n\r\nAnd since all errors are nothing else but distinct interfaces, the list is completely extensible forever without without ever breaking any users.",
