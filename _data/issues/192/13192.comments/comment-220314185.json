	"body": "ppc64 BE uses ABI v1 and ppc64 LE uses ABI v2.  You can't build gcc on a ppc64 BE machine with ABI v2, because everything else on a ppc64 BE machine expects ABI v1 (dynamic linker, assembler, shared libraries, etc.)  The golang for ppc64 BE must generate the linking environment that is consistent with ABI v1 for it to link correctly and run there.\r\n\r\nI did some further investigation on this back when I opened the issue which I didn't add to this issue.  There is a lot missing in golang for GOARCH=ppc64 with respect to external linking on ABI v1.  The call stubs are not correct, the PLT is not set up correctly, plus probably some other things, in addition to the defining of the .TOC. symbol. @tdolby",
