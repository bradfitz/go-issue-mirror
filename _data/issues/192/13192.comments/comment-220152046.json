	"body": "@laboger I've got to the same point as you have (followed Ian's instructions and now the build can't find .TOC. entries) and it looks like the ELF v2 ABI isn't implemented on ppc64be in any of the gcc versions I've tried (4.4, 4.8, 5) , which is why we don't see .TOC. entries being created. \r\n\r\n This can verified by running strings on a generated .o file created using gcc on big- and little-endian and comparing the output. I've tried specifying -mabi=elfv2 on the gcc command line to force it on big-endian, but it's unable to find gnu/stubs-64-v2.h and the compile fails. I've also tried to hack the cgo code to use .toc (lower case), but that's not worked either.\r\n\r\n Looks like a rebuild of gcc with ABI v2 might be needed to get things going, or cross-compiling as @aleek has done.",
