It was very important\nto get ppc64le working in Go 1.6 with external linking and that seems to \nbe working well and that is a very good thing.\n\nThis question is mainly for my understanding, in case the importance of \nBE changes and I'm asked what it\nwould take to make it work. I wasn't sure if it was thought that Minux' \nprevious patches contained most of the needed function\nor if there were some known pieces missing.  I might have thought at one \ntime they worked OK on BE but now I'm not sure on that\nbecause I probably didn't understand the variations that needed testing.\n\nOn 12/07/2015 10:48 AM, Russ Cox wrote:\n\u003e\n\u003e @laboger \u003chttps://github.com/laboger\u003e, my understanding is that the \n\u003e patches Minux posted a while back do work (I think you've said that), \n\u003e but they no longer apply cleanly, and Minux has not had time to update \n\u003e them to the latest Go tree.
