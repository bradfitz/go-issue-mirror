(Minux is a volunteer; his day job is being a grad student.) \r\n\r\nIf you or anyone else would like to take over those patches, get them to apply to the tree, and send them in for review, we can get them in for Go 1.6. \r\n\r\nMore generally, my understanding was that ppc64 (big-endian) was not as important as ppc64le, and that ppc64le support is committed and working. If that's wrong please let me know. Thanks.",
