Using Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003 here. Both have\nsingle cpu. I am wandering if number of cpus makes any difference. Or, perhaps, my\ncomputers are slow.\n\nIf you can reproduce the problem in your environment, perhaps, you could run test with\n-test.timeout=30 parameter. This way test will blow in 30 seconds if it hangs, and we\nall will have stack trace to look at. Not sure if it is much help, but ...\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
