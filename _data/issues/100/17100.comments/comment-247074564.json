But as @ianlancetaylor has said in the golang-nuts discussion, the reason for the restriction is that a variable that has been assigned to but that's not used often indicates a problem in the code (and a variable that's declared but not used counts as 'assigned to' because it's initialized to its zero value). The same is true for labels. An unused constant really doesn't pose a problem.\r\n\r\nThus, the other rules are really motivated by problems encountered in praxis, which is not the case here. We'd rather have fewer rules, after all, not more.",
