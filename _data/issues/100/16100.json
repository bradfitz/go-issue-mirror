	"title": "net/http: no way of manipulating timeouts in Handler",
	"body": "A `Handler` has no way of changing the underlying connection Deadline, since it has no access to the `net.Conn` (except by maintaining a map from `RemoteAddr` to `net.Conn` via `Server.ConnState`, but it's more than anyone should need to do). Moreover, it can't implement a timeout itself because the `Close` method of the `ResponseWriter` implementation is not documented to unblock concurrent `Write`s.\r\n\r\nThis means that if the server has a WriteTimeout, the connection has a definite lifespan, and streaming is impossible. So **servers with any streaming endpoints are forced not to implement timeouts at all** on the entire Server.\r\n\r\nA possible solution might be to expose the net.Conn in the Context. Another could be to allow interface upgrades to the `SetDeadline` methods on ResponseWriter. Yet another would be to make `(*response).Close` unblock `(*response).Write`.",
