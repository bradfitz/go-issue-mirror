I want to say, mount this\ndirectory there, not take this url path, then add it on to the filepath I give.   What\nif I wanted the urlpath to not match the filepath?   If I want to call\n\u003ca href=\"http://mysite/somefiles\"\u003ehttp://mysite/somefiles\u003c/a\u003e and map it to /projects/someonesfolder  then I would be out of\nluck and have to use some other muxer.\u003c/pre\u003e",
