Each declared type has an underlying type that goes back to the [basic types discussed earlier](https://tour.golang.org/basics/11). \r\n\r\nLet's define a type that is also a struct, which is made up of multiple fields.\"\r\n\r\nNo matter the wording, I'm a fan of 2-3 sentences here. Types turning into types sounds like a Dr Seuss riddle at first. Smaller, simpler sentences help break that down. \r\n",
