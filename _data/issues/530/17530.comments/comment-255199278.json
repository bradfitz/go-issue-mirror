In this case, if `drop()` returns 0, you should not have to pay for the extra copy...\r\n\r\nAnyway, as you said, it *can* be avoided. \r\n\r\nI just thought I'd point-out the issue (and the fact that it can easily be fixed). Whether something should be done about it, is a judgement call, and is up to you...",
