I had assumed (without looking into it too much) that\nif you do,\n\nif x, ok := x.(reflect.ArrayOrSliceType); ok {\n}\n\nthen the type of x would be one of *reflect.ArrayType or *reflect.SliceType\nwithin the body of the if.\n\nThis is not the case. The interface is also implemented by\n*MapType, *PtrType and *ChanType.\n\nPerhaps it might be worth considering making the interface\na little more exclusive to help in avoiding this pitfall.\u003c/pre\u003e",
