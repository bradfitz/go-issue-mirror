There is some background in\r\nthe CL, https://codereview.appspot.com/8134043 (not as much as I had\r\nhoped), and references issue golang/go#5141\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Jan 8, 2015 at 10:39 AM, Matthew Dempsky \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n\u003e I was trying to repro issue #9510\r\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/9510\u003e. I'm on a linux/amd64 system,\r\n\u003e and I used \"GOARCH=386 ./make.bash --no-clean\" to setup a cross-compiler\r\n\u003e toolchain. However, subsequently running \"GOARCH=386 go build issue\" per\r\n\u003e iant@'s instructions yielded an unhelpful \"no buildable Go source files\r\n\u003e in .../issue/a\" error.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e Poking into the package go/build source code, I discovered mention of\r\n\u003e \"CGO_ENABLED\" so I tried \"GOARCH=386 CGO_ENABLED=1 go build issue\". This\r\n\u003e worked to reproduce the issue.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e However, trying to learn more about this setting, I found this in\r\n\u003e cmd/cgo/doc.go:\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e To enable cgo during cross compiling builds, set the CGO_ENABLED\r\n\u003e environment variable to 1 when building the Go tools with make.bash.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e So I inferred I was misusing it and decided to startover with \"GOARCH=386\r\n\u003e CGO_ENABLED=1 ./make.bash --no-clean\" instead, but then running just\r\n\u003e \"GOARCH=386 go build issue\" again produced the same \"no buildable Go source\r\n\u003e files\" error.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e Confusingly, src/make.bash also seems to mention CGO_ENABLED having some\r\n\u003e significance, but at the moment (even having poked through run.bash and\r\n\u003e grep'd the source code), I'm still not sure I entirely understand the\r\n\u003e significance.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e â€”\r\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\r\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/9530\u003e.\r\n\u003e",
