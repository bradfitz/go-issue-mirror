Cgo doesn't do any rechecking, so you could theoretically run into a situation where go picks up a new resolv.conf, but a strangely encoded hostname kicks it to cgo which will presumably then fail.  I have no idea what windows does, but this seems to be inconsistent.  Does this matter to anyone?  \r\nAssuming none of that matters, is it preferred that \r\na - every lookup kicks off a stat and checks modtime\r\nb - every lookup kicks off a stat if x seconds have passed since the last one (and what is x?)\r\nc - a stat/recheck is only kicked off if there is an error during lookup\r\n\r\nSorry to make a fuss about this, I dread this default DNS changing in the current state.",
