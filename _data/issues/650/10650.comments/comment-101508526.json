	"body": "Thanks Josh.  I submitted https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/9991/, please take a look since you also have a vested interest in this logic.  Overall, I'm still not overly pleased with either method and think it should ultimately be relegated to occur on errors or else not at all and defer to the client, so I won't be overly upset if you like the old style better.  A discussion for another time I suppose.  This bug should be fixed either way, so if you have reasons to prefer the extra goroutine, I'll just abandon and open another that addresses only this bug.",
