	"body": "o(∩_∩)o Hello,everyone.\r\nI am a new developer to use gomobile. I hope that I could get the answer here.\r\n\r\nI build the example successfully and these can run okay.\r\nHowever,when I try to change the default application icon,I get the problem.\r\nI create the subdirectory named \"res/drawable\" ,put the ic_launcher.png into it.Then, modify AndroidManifest.xml :\r\n```\r\n\u003capplication android:label=\"DebugApp\"  \r\n             android:icon=\"@drawable/ic_launcher\" \u003e\r\n  ...others...\r\n\u003c/application\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter build, I use 7z to unzip the apk file , then found that the \"res\" is not copied to output.\r\nYES,the problem is Here.\r\n\r\nWhen I get help from `\"gomobile build -help\"`,I can saw these:\r\n`\"If the package directory contains an assets subdirectory, its contents are copied into the output.\"`\r\nBut,the document above is not mention the \"RES\" subdirectory.\r\n\r\nAfter look up googing and GoDoc, I really have no idea how to include the \"res\" subdirectory and generate resources.arsc.\r\nSo,is anyone get the answer? Or, will the gomobile project support this in the future ?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nWaiting for your reply.",
