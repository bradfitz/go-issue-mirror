	"body": "ClientHelloInfo is how callbacks make decisions on how to treat an incoming connection, which is becoming very powerful with https://golang.org/cl/30790/\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16066#issuecomment-250608294 it would be useful to have some more information in there. \r\n\r\nThe Cloudflare fork exposes Version, SignatureSchemes and LocalAddr. RemoteAddr seems fitting for completeness. ALPNProtocols as asked in #16066.\r\n\r\nLooking at clientHelloMsg, only session resumption information, ocspStapling and scts are left, for which I can't think of a use case.",
