	"body": "I looked briefly into this but it's like gcc is actively working against us. I love the fact that the -fdebug-prefix-map command-line argument gets embedded into the binary when the whole point of that flag is to specify something to keep out.\n\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/17943 has my work in progress. Until gcc or clang wants to cooperate I don't see much point in heroics. I do see that clang seems to have added support for -fdebug-prefix-map very recently, not that we can rely on it being available.",
