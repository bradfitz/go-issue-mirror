	"body": "Hello.\r\n\r\nI recently spent some time trying to figure why a template with Funcmaps would work with Parse() but not with ParseFiles() when using Execute (instead of ExecuteTemplate with the name). \r\n\r\nI found the answer in Stack Overflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10199219/go-template-function but the question also appeared in golang-nuts, for example here https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/CI9WdC_sk00 and here https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/vmZHHfLsH8M\r\n\r\nPlease consider if it should be better documented to make it less error-prone for inexperienced users.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",
