While we are at it, there is also [bgzf](http://godoc.org/github.com/biogo/hts/bgzf), which makes seeking inside a compressed file possible via a small addition to the gzip format.\r\n\r\nEither way, I don't see any reason for this feature to be in the standard library. For the most common use-case (webservers), you get non benefit from parallel compression.",
