Boiled down example:\n\npackage p\n\n//line file:2\n\n// G doc.\nfunc G()\n\n\n\nbut change the line number to file:10 and the comment is correctly dropped. It appears\nthat the problem is that various pieces of the parser assume they can do comparisons\nagainst the raw line number returned by f.Line(pos), but they cannot: they need to\ncompare against both the file and the line number.\nOr perhaps the token.File needs to expose a RawLine() int that is 1 + the actual number\nof \\ns before that point in the input, meaning the line number ignoring //line\ndirectives, and then the parser would use that.\n\nNot going to happen for Go 1.2.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **go1.3**, removed **go1.2**._",
