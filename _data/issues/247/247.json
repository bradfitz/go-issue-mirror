	"body": "by **josef.svenningsson**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe Go language specification is silent about what happens if there are\nmultiple senders and/or receivers on a channel. Suppose there are two\nreceivers blocked, waiting to receive from a channel. When a sender sends a\nvalue on the channel, who gets it?\n\nIf I had a say in the matter I would go for the natural and intuitive FIFO\nsemantics where the receiver which was first to block is the one to receive\na message when it becomes available. Same thing for blocking senders.\u003c/pre\u003e",
