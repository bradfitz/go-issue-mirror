	"body": "A program that uses archive/tar doesn't produce identical output even for identical inputs because writePAXHeader encodes the current process ID into the output.\r\n\r\nThe reason the code does this is that POSIX.1 suggests using this behavior by default.  See http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695299/utilities/pax.html, exthdr.name.  That might be a reasonable thing for a command-line 'tar' utility, and it's intended only as a default, but it's a horrible hardwired behavior for an archive package's API.\r\n\r\nI think we should replace this field with zero.",
