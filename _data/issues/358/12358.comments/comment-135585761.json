Deterministic output is nice, but the first goal of `archive/tar` is to make valid tar archives, not to be useful as an input to some other system that wants deterministic input.\r\n\r\nIt *does* seem reasonable to provide a way to override that default, though. A new field in the `tar.Header` type to override it would be a better move.",
