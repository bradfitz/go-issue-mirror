	"title": "encoding/xml: support for xml:lang attribute",
	"body": "xml:lang is a standard attribute defined by the XML specification.  Using it is complicated by the fact that an element inherits the nearest xml:lang declaration on itself or an ancestor.  For example:\r\n\r\n````\r\n  \u003cdocument\u003e\r\n    \u003cfoo xml:lang=\"en-GB\"\u003e\r\n      \u003cbar\u003eThis is in en-GB\u003c/bar\u003e\r\n   \u003c/foo\u003e\r\n \u003c/document\u003e\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe element bar has an effective xml:lang value of \"en-GB\".\r\n\r\nAt the moment, an application wanting access to this information would need to consume an XML document token by token, and maintain its own stack of xml:lang attributes (or include an xml:lang attribute on all parent structs being unmarshalled, and process those). It would be nice if Decoder maintained this stack itself, and exposed it to structs being unmarshaled so that you could easily get the current effective xml:lang attribute.\r\n\r\nThere is code to do the above here:\r\n\r\nhttps://code.blinkace.com/go/xml/commit/6dbed72bf9bec281c053aee80af76ac542a395c9\r\n\r\n",
