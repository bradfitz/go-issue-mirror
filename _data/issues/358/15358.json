What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\ndarwin/amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nI went to http://play.golang.org/p/YMf_UBvDsH\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nA shared post\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nForbidden\r\n\r\nI was having a chat with the chaps on #go-nuts, they suspect that the /28 IP range we switched too last night might appear to be from the PRC or something - it's not, it's Brisbane Australia (poke all the fun you like, but some of us actually have internet)\r\n\r\nI can visit http://play.golang.org and play as much as I like, but the share button is missing and if I try to view other peoples posts then I get 403 Forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe IP I'm coming from is 103.58.192.211 (we actually have the whole 103.58.192.0/22), there are no proxies at this end.\r\n",
