It does sound useful to do `io.LimitReader(rand.New(rand.NewSource(seed), length)` to generate a deterministic random-looking stream.\r\n\r\nOne way to get the determinism you want would be to wrap `rand.NewSource` with a `iotest.OneByteReader`.  And then probably a `bufio.Reader` for efficiency.  But you've convinced me, I'm ok with doing this directly in `rand`.",
