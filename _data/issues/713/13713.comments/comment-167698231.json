Here are the steps:\r\n\r\n- Have 1.5 installed and 'go get' in a project under GOPATH which does:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport \"golang.org/x/net/http2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n(AFAICS this is a valid use case of the above package in a server capacity...)\r\n\r\n- Install 1.6beta1.\r\n\r\n- Type go get in any project (even if it doesn't reference golang.org/x/net/http2). The permission error occurs then.\r\n\r\nI was able to get things to work just be removing my $GOPATH/src/golang.org directory.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is something that needs to be thought about prior to 1.6 release...",
