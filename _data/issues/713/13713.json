	"body": "Whenever I run 'go get' on my http2 using project, I get the following:\r\n\r\n```go install vendor/golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack: open /usr/local/go/pkg/darwin_amd64/vendor/golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack.a: permission denied```\r\n\r\nI'm not importing golang.org/x/net/http2 directly. I'm using the published darwin amd64 pkg for 1.6beta1.\r\n\r\nI don't really know why I'm getting this error as the file already exists. I guess it's trying to update it for some reason, but the help for 'go get' says this:\r\n\r\nGet never checks out or updates code stored in vendor directories.\r\n\r\nAm I doing something stupid?",
