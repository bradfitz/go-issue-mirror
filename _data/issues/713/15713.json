	"body": "Attached is a stab at a TLS benchmark (crypto/tls has none!).\r\nIt runs b.N TLS connections in sequence, each transferring 16 MB in each direction in 64 kB writes.\r\n[tlsbench_test.go.txt](https://github.com/golang/go/files/267421/tlsbench_test.go.txt)\r\n\r\nThrough Go 1.5 it was hovering around 30 MB/s on my workstation.\r\nGo 1.6 made it jump by almost 10X, to around 295 MB/s.\r\nAt tip, however, it is down a bit, around 235 MB/s.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to understand this. This might be something to do soon after the beta is released.\r\n\r\n/cc @agl",
