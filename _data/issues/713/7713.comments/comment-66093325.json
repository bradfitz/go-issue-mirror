He only said his case is \"more complex\" but never\nshown a particular \"complex\" case which current regexp package cannot solve. As the guy\neven seemingly never accepted the fact that package regexp does not backtrace, I tend to\nthink that his understanding of REs is not sound and his non presented actual use case\nprobably _is_ covered by the current regexp package. Also I think the implementation\nwould be problematic - excluding certain states from a state set lazily is IMO not very\ncompatible with what (executing) a NFA is, and it sounds like backtracking.\u003c/pre\u003e",
