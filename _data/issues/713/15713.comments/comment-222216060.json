	"body": "To follow-up on the above CL, I tried loading a very simple web page (16KB HTML file that imports one 16KB script in \u003chead\u003e) served over HTTP/2 on a simulated 2G connection (1200ms RTT, 200kbps throughput). Page load time results over a median of 5 runs:\r\n\r\nMax record sizing: 6.2s\r\nDynamic record sizing before cl/23487: 4.6s\r\nDynamic record sizing after cl/23487: 5.2s\r\n\r\nWeb benchmarking is hard. The benchmark I chose is a \"best case\" for dynamic record sizing in some ways, with a very slow client and a very simple page. The reason dynamic record sizing is slightly slower after cl/23487 is that the HTML actually starts on the third data packet -- the first packet has h2 settings and the second packet has h2 response headers.\r\n\r\nIf I were to propose any changes, I might propose changing the sequence to 1,1,1,2,3,4,5,etc. But, I think this is a good enough compromise between throughput/latency. We can revisit this later if it becomes a problem.\r\n\r\n/cc @rsc",
