	"body": "It causes a significant performance drop when measured by throughput, but a performance increase when measured by latency, particularly for slow connections. For a simple web page served via HTTPS over a simulated 2G connection, I measured a ~500ms improvement in page load time with dynamic record sizing. There's more background in the first comment of issue #14376 and in the discussion with agl in the linked CL.\r\n\r\nI can try to cook up a more reusable latency-centric benchmark if you like. I tend to believe that most clients will use TLS via HTTPS, and for those clients, latency is more important than throughput early in the connection. I am somewhat worried about over-tuning for a throughput benchmark when many uses are not actually throughput-limited.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't feel too strongly about whether this should default to \"on\" or \"off\". If you feel strongly one way or the other, let's go with that. We tried to avoid knobs other than a single on/off bool, but I'm happy to change the bool to an int if you think that will help (I actually had an int in a prior version of the CL). I do feel strongly about reverting this -- given that it demonstrably improves latency, I think the feature should stay in some form.",
