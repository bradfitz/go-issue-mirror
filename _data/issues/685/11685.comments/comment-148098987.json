	"body": "@ianlancetaylor CC=\"xxx yyy zzz\" is ambiguous because it is uncertain whether the executable is \"xxx\" or \"xxx yyy zzz\". One way to decide is first to look whether there exists \"xxx yyy zzz\" executable, if it doesn't than for check existence of \"xxx yyy\", etc. `go build` does not know beforehand whether the name has spaces in it or not.\r\n\r\nIn the absolute, fixing this issue is impossible because solving it would require go build to know the mind's meaning of spaces in \"xxx yyy zzz\". Even if the build checks for the existence of \"$PATH/xxx yyy zzz\", it doesn't guarantee that the person really meant \"$PATH/xxx yyy zzz\" because the existence of \"$PATH/xxx yyy zzz\" may just be a coincidence that the person did not took into account.",
