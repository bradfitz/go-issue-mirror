I don't believe this ever worked.\nInternally C.foo becomes a name like *_C_foo. Those names are different in different\npackages: you cannot pass a *gdk._C_foo where a *cairo._C_foo is expected.\n\nThis may have worked in the past because cgo was incorrectly turning all undefined\nstructs into *[0]byte, so that they were all interchangeable.\n\nCL \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/76450043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/76450043\u003c/a\u003e fixed this. I think the fix is correct and\nthat your original program was incorrect.\n\nThis issue is now about documenting the [0]byte change in that CL.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
