The child\nmust have been there if the headers were all read correctly, and the child shouldn't\nalready be gone, since it has 1 MB of data to write.  It's not possible that on older OS\nX, the pipe has a buffer size \u003e= 1 MB, is it?\n\nThe other possibility is that isProcessRunning (signals?) is unreliable on old OS X:\n\nfrom posix_test.go:\n\nfunc isProcessRunning(t *testing.T, pid int) bool {\n\tp, err := os.FindProcess(pid)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn false\n\t}\n        return p.Signal(syscall.Signal(0)) == nil\n}\u003c/pre\u003e",
