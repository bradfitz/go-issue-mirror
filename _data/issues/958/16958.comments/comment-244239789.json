	"body": "Yeah, ReadTimeout is extremely ill-specified (and implemented).\r\n\r\nRelated bugs:\r\n\r\n* #14204 for Go 1.8 is about adding Server.IdleTimeout. Part of that should be documenting and fixing ReadTimeout and making it apply, for 2nd+ requests on a conn, to be from the 1st byte received, and IdleTimeout would be the part in-between.\r\n\r\n* #16450 ReadTimeout is pretty badly broken for http2 connections, never resetting. Which makes ReadTimeout even more unusable.\r\n\r\nThose two should be fixed together.\r\n\r\nI haven't re-read this bug enough to understand whether there's a unique problem here, or just a different view on one of the existing ones.",
