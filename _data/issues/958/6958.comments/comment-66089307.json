Why? Go has Go way of doing things.\n\nYou said you're trying to help to make Go better, I certainly appreciate that.\nHowever, all issues that you filed are not valid for one reason or another.\nFor this particular issue, as I explained several times, the Go command will try\nto determine the relative timestamp of source and *.a files, and only rebuild\nthe later when necessary. If you don't preserve the timestamp when installing\nGo (I know a lot of package management software mess with timestamps, so\nyou're not alone), Go will try to rebuilt all standard library. That's not a Go\nbug in any way.\n\nThe official way to install Go on OS X is either building from source, use the\nofficially signed pkg installer files.\u003c/pre\u003e",
