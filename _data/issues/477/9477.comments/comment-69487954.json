Then mark bmap as noScan. This will make scanning very fast, as we won't scan any user data.\r\nIn reality it will be somewhat more complex, because we will need to remove old overflow buckets from allOverflow. And also it will increase size of hmap, so it may require some reshuffling of data as well.",
