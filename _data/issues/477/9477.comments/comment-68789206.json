	"body": "@rhysh, it is an interesting idea to allocate overflow buckets as a single array (perhaps contiguous with the main buckets).  Then we could use bucket ids instead of pointers to reference them.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that there's no a priori maximum number of overflow buckets needed.  It depends on how the hashing works out.  It could be as bad as half the size of the main bucket array.  You wouldn't want to allocate this worst case ahead of time.  Maybe there would be a way to trigger growth on # of used overflow buckets instead of on just the number of entries as we do now.  That way, we could have a fixed maximum, say 10%, of overflow buckets allocated at the start and we grow if we run out of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
