But I don't see how that could be the cause of this problem.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix this problem, we need some way to reproduce it.  Is there any way we can reproduce it ourselves?\r\n\r\nHas it happened more than twice?\r\n\r\nIs there any similarity between the times that it happened?  For example, did it happen on the same machine, or on different ones?\r\n\r\nIs there a chance that you could try the 1.7 beta release to see if it makes any difference?",
