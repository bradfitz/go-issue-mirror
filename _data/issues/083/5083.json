For instance, I cannot\nfind an explanation that changed made by a function with a map argument will be visible\nin the caller. It's even more important to specify this for slices, since the header is\nnot shared but the array is. Channels would never work without this sharing property,\nbut again it's not well specified.\u003c/pre\u003e",
