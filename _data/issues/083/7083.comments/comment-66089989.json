I found this earlier today while debugging a\ncrash in html/template that I thought was caused my own changes to the\nliveness code. At the time I thought it didn't fix this issue: I reran\ngo/doc and it still crashed, but it looks like I just didn't recompile\nenough code with the fix.\n\nThree CLs on the way:\n\n51010045 cmd/gc: return canonical Node* from temp\n51820043 cmd/gc: add -live flag for debugging liveness maps\n51830043 runtime: emit collection stacks in GODEBUG=allocfreetrace mode\n\nThe first is the bug fix; the others are just help for next time.\u003c/pre\u003e",
