This are few\nvery basic grammar rules which contradict you:\n\n1. \"-er\" as used here is an agentive ending;\n2. when creating words using the \"-er\" agent suffix, for two-syllable verbs that end in\na single vowel followed by a single consonant other than w, x, or y, double the final\nconsonant then add the agent suffix.\n\nI believe is fairly clear that you are wrong, and if you have no evidence to back this\n(I admit that this could be something that I don't have knowledge about) you are\nprobably wrong.\nIf you find this as a too minor issue, I can take the time to submit a patch with the\ncorrection...\u003c/pre\u003e",
