This is ok, in case one is doing the build \nmanually. If one wants to make the build automatically, e.g. on a system like \nBSD ports (an example is MacPorts on OS X), this makes it quite hard.\nTo enable automatic builds for these packaging systems would be nice.\n\nThis would obviously be an enhancement.\u003c/pre\u003e",
