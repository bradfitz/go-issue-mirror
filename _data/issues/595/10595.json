	"body": "It might make sense at some point to make the heap bitmap march forward in memory, parallel to the arena, instead of marching backward in memory like it does now, reversed from the arena.\n\nCL https://go-review.googlesource.com/9404 does this, but it's much slower. \n\nClosing but leaving here so we can find it later.",
