	"body": "I've looked at this in a bit more detail and played with various rewordings, incl. your proposal. I sent out a CL to clarify the wording instead of changing syntax.\r\n\r\n(Specifically, adding the explicit syntax for receivers brings undue attention to the optional comma, which we want to permit for regularity and simpler implementation, but would likely raise question marks for a more novice reader.)\r\n\r\nI am very sympathetic to the idea that the formal grammar in the spec should be exactly the grammar that is accepted by a compiler. However, in many cases that would make the grammar much more unwieldy. Keep in mind that the spec is meant for human consumption; i.e., there is a delicate balance between formalism and readability. Another aspect is the implementation: As is, it is clear that a compiler can simply re-use all the work that went into parameter parsing, followed by a few semantic checks.\r\n",
