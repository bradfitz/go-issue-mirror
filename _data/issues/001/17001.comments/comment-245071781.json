See\n\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/kULH591JrR\n\nThe rational number determined by the string \"4/3/2\" should probably be 2/3\n-- being (4/3)/2 -- or could conceivably be 8/3 -- being 4/(3/2) -- but\ncertainly shouldn't be 4/3. Similarly, the rational number determined by\nthe string \"5/2.5\" should probably be undefined -- because the floating\npoint value 2.5 probably shouldn't be considered to be exact -- or could\nconceivably be 2, but certainly shouldn't be 5/2. And the rational number\ndetermined by the string \"6/5abc\" should probably be undefined, but\ncurrently is 6/5.\n\nSo I feel that this is a bug.\n\n\n-- \nTom Coates\nProfessor of Mathematics\nImperial College London\n",
