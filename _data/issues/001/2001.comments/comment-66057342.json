I can't get the GC to run at the right moment.\n\nWith GOGCTRACE=1 I can see that the program in question deadlocks with the first call to\nthe GC.\n\nI can email you binaries and strace logs if that helps. Alternatively, I add some\ndebugging output in the runtime if you could provide some guidance about which variables\nyou need to see.\u003c/pre\u003e",
