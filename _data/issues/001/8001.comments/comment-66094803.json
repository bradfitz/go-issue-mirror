A user can hold on to a copy of\nthe timer from the Ticker and allow the Ticker to be garbage collected. In that case, we\ndon't want to stop the Ticker. In fact, Tick does exactly that.\n\nAs far as I know, there is no way to notice when the channel itself is destroyed (I\ndon't mean a value of type chan, but the channel that backs it). Thus, I don't see any\nway of noticing when a Ticker isn't used anymore.\u003c/pre\u003e",
