What to do about unknown zone names (like EDT in California)? Right\nnow we record the name but use +0000 as the offset. We could instead\nreturn an error from Parse.\n\n2. What to do about known zone names that do not apply to the given\ntime (like January PDT in California)? Right now we record the name\nbut use +0000 as the offset, because athough PDT is known in\nCalifornia, it is not in effect in January, so we treat it as an\nunknown zone. We could instead record PDT's real offset even though\nJanuary times are conventionally written in PST, the same way we\naccept January 32 even though it is conventionally written as February\n1.\u003c/pre\u003e",
