Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Create an HTTP Response or Request with a content-length of -1, indicating that the\ncontent length is unknown, under HTTP/1.0 or when using a non-chunked transfer encoding.\n2. Call {Response, Request}.Write\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nThe request or response with the body included, for example: \n\nHTTP/1.0 200 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n\nThis is a sample HTML page\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nHTTP/1.0 200 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThis occurs due to a missing check in the WriteBody code of the transferWriter, since\nio.LimitReader is used with a negative limit, causing it to close immediately.\u003c/pre\u003e",
