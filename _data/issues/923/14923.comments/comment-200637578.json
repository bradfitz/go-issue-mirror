Can't go just check if the path is a file or a directory?\r\n\r\nMy package is not the only one I have found ending in .go. I can very well rename it to have the .golang suffix (or any other name) and avoid this issue. But what about the several packages out there with the same issue (and future ones that will run into it eventually)?\r\n\r\nI agree that the name of the package is not good, but go tools failing inconsistently due to directories with the .go suffix without being noisy about it is worse imho.\r\n\r\nReference: https://github.com/gojp/goreportcard/issues/90",
