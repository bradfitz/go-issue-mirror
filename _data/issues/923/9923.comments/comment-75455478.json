The only new error they get is `ENOTEMPTY` from an `syscall.Unlinkat`, which they should actually expect when they look at the man page.\r\n\r\nThe os-Package, which provides the abstractions to be used, handles this all correctly by looking for specific errors at `os.Remove` and implementing all other functionality using that abstraction.",
