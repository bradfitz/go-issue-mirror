Maybe it's better to file an issue for\nthe Go-side support?\n\nThis is such a basic feature that any assembler (other than Plan 9 assembler) I have\never used (even ancient Zilog 80 assemblers!) has this feature. I have the impression\nthat at the time Plan 9 assembler was written, the authors didn't imagine that alignment\nis a real issue and enforcing \"native-alignment\" (64-bits for amd64 for instance) as the\n\"one true alignment\", without any options, is the best way to go.\n\nIn this age of SSE/AVX, such an assumption is no longer valid and causes performance\nproblems.\u003c/pre\u003e",
