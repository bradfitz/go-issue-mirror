What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n  * Documentation detailing deprecations should not point to code that is also deprecated.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n  * https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Transport.CancelRequest, points to another solution which is also deprecated: https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request. \r\n\r\nI would not mind submitting a patch for this, simply updating the Transport.CancelRequest deprecation message to match the message in Request.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
