No sense trying to be too sophisticated.\n\nI don't know often this would be useful. Certainly sometimes (especially in\na \"add more and more debug prints\" cycle), but it will obviously also have\na small cost all the time. Seems worth trying out, I'll try to hack\nsomething up between now and 1.8 early.\n\nOn 20 May 2016 at 06:56, Josh Bleecher Snyder \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e IIUC, the plan would be to do something like check the SHA of the export\n\u003e data.
