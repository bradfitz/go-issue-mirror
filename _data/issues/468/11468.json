	"body": "Right now the output looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo tool pprof https://host:port/debug/pprof/profile\r\nFetching profile from https://host:port/debug/pprof/profile\r\nPlease wait... (30s)\r\nhttp fetch https://host:port/debug/pprof/profile: Get https://host:port/debug/pprof/profile: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome to be able to pass a --insecure option (like when using curl) so that you don't need to add the self signed certificate to the system's trusted root certificate store to collect profiles. \r\n\r\n/cc @bradfitz\r\n",
