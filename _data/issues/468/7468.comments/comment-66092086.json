Since you\ndon't know what is the proportion between these parts, you can't make sense out of\nHeapSys and heap profile -- heap profile shows less than HeapSys, but you don't know\nwhat part of that difference is stacks.\nmprof profile and memstats must be consistent and allow to verify sanity (tell whether\nmprof lies or not).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.3**, **repo-main**._",
