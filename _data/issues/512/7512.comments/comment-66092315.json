It won't be created when the method is\nwritten, because that code doesn't know about the interface.  It won't be created when\nthe interface is created, because that code doesn't know about S.next.  It won't be\ncreated when the code is compiled to convert the empty interface to Iterator, because\nthat code also doesn't know about S.Next.\n\nYou suggest that the thunk is created when building the itable(S, Iterator), but that\nitable is built only at runtime.  At compile time we don't know that the itable is\nneeded.\u003c/pre\u003e",
