Because now we're talking about efficiency (and there's no point talking about\nefficiency if it wouldn't work at all)...   Previously, it sounded like you were\ndescribing a technical issue which meant that it was not possible?\n\nIf we're down to efficiency, obviously the next step is for me to implement this, to\ndemonstrate that the cost is trivial and the benefits undeniable ;-)\n\nBut again, I'm not sure I ever really got to the bottom of your technical concerns, so\nis there something you're aware of that I'm missing?  If so, I'd appreciate a heads-up -\nit would potentially save me a lot of time.\u003c/pre\u003e",
