Implicit conversion is done elsewhere,\nso I find it inconsistent that it is not done for interface return types.  I recognize\nthat it is different, but it is not different on first sight (i.e. you have to think to\nrealize why it would not be this way).\n\nI also think the way to get better tooling is perhaps to discourage the use of Regexes,\nrather than hobbling the language to cater to things we should really be discouraging :-)\n\nMore seriously though, which tools would it break?\u003c/pre\u003e",
