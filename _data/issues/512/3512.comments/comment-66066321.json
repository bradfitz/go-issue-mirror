I argue App Engine's\nlack of unsafe + gccgo vs gc already introduce three big worlds of differing performance\ncharacteristics.\n\n\u003e though of course somebody would have to actually do the work.\n\nI did it earlier. See comment #10 above. I barely close to no feedback on it, though.\n\nWhat I'd like is a decision that we can actually do this.\n\nI very much don't want a language change.  In my CL above, I just looked for\nm[string(b)] and made a fake stringheader from b.\u003c/pre\u003e",
