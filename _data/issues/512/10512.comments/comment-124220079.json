I imagine one could optimize repeated processor IDs within a trace buffer to save space.\r\n\r\n\u003e However, we will end up with some ranges with offsets that make trace valid, and then we will need to choose a particular offset from the range somehow.\r\n\r\nThat's certainly true. I suspect these ranges will be small, but don't have anything to support that claim. I would certainly expect them to be small if there are closely causally related events in the trace, which is probably where they're most interesting, and the more causally related events, the more precise the alignment would get. I believe Dapper does something like this [[Sigelman, 2010, ยง2.1](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36356.pdf)].",
