EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION means memory access error - most common would be dereferencing 0 pointer. You can try and debug this yourself - just insert extra printf statements inside of WrapOCIEnvCreate to try and understand what is happening. Is error happening in WrapOCIEnvCreate? Or is it happening inside external OCIEnvCreate function? If it happens inside of OCIEnvCreate, print its parameters and make sure they are correct.\r\n\r\nAlex",
