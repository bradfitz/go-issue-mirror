	"body": "@alexbrainman I tried your first suggestion linking using the -linkmode flag and it worked:\r\n```\r\ngo build -ldflags \"-linkmode internal\" oracle-connect.go\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe strange thing is that in one of my machines it started working all of a sudden, even if I don't pass the -linkmode flag. I tried forcing external and internal and both work. I created a simpler package that only calls this first method of the OCI.dll, but I am still trying to get consistent results.\r\n\r\nAs for ODBC, my application needs to query and format up to 5 million database rows as fast as possible. Right now the speed is around 35k rows per second, and from my previous experience I don't think ODBC will come even close to that. But I will try your driver, it might surprise me.",
