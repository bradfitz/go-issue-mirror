So linker would have to be still writing into test binary, while the test binary is already running. Strange.\r\n\r\nWe did discovered some problem with linker recently. We had to add file flush here https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/18057/22/src/cmd/link/internal/ld/lib.go@1033 to make gcc see output properly. Perhaps there is something similar here.\r\n\r\nAlex",
