	"body": "Hello @quentinmit, I'm a little confused as to your suggestion. I know renaming the directory to not contain .git will fix the linker issue, but it breaks the import path in all Go files that import it. Having read the link you refer to, a few times, it seems my use case should already work? The code is hosted on a [gogs](https://gogs.io/) instance which I believe serves content with the meta tag information Go looks for, but I'm not sure if that works over git+ssh which is what I'm using. Although I just remembered in my git config I have it set to use user@domain.com instead of https://domain.com. I think this was to force git+ssh with a specific user. I'm not sure if that factors into this issue",
