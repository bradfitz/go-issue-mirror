Some people also proposed some options for tracing, like disable stack collection.\r\nWe don't need to decide on all that for 1.5, I am sure we will have more trace-related functions in future, so it can make sense to move all trace-related functions to runtime/trace before the release.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
