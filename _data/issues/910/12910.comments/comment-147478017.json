To open the CA database the developer needs to download XCA and open/export the certificates from there. The given CA file contains 4 CAs and 2 server certificates. One is for `server.example.com` and the other is for `*.example.com`. I hope it's ok to add some binary file to that issue, but it's the most convient way to re-use my work. \r\n\r\n You can find the files for the CA [here](http://fedux-org.github.io/data/issues/golang/go/12910/). It's a data repository hosted with Github Pages. Unfortunately I was not able to add the files to this issue. The most relevant file is the `ca.xdb`-file. It contains the CA database.\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1267524/10434640/1b9d126c-711b-11e5-9135-dba3695577c5.PNG)\r\n",
