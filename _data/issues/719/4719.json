	"body": "\u003cpre\u003e(after discussion with Russ, trying to summarize here)\n\nIt's nice to be able to tell people to set $GOPATH == $HOME, which means their source\ngoes into $HOME/src and their binaries conveniently go into $HOME/bin.\n\nThe only wart with $GOPATH == $HOME is the $HOME/pkg directory, which is pretty ugly,\nnot useful for end users, and somewhat offensive to be littering in people's $HOME.\n\nIf \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/4443\"\u003eissue #4443\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/3895\"\u003eissue #3895\u003c/a\u003e get fixed, $GOPATH/pkg might get even uglier.\n\nUnlike $GOROOT/pkg, $GOPATH/pkg doesn't contain tool binaries.  It's pretty much just a\ncache.\n\nCan't cmd/go's *.a cache go into /tmp/go-cache-$USER 0700 or ~/Library/Caches with\nappropriate occasional lazy cleaning?  (or letting the system clean).\u003c/pre\u003e",
