I understand that recent versions of the go tool will hash all the file names used to build a .a file to help keep the cache accurate. But different versions of a package in different GOPATHs could easily have the same file list but different code. It seems to me either separate caches are required per GOPATH (as the pkg directory does today) or the cache key would need to include something to differentiate between the multiple GOPATHs used.",
