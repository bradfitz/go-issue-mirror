	"body": "We should run at least non-root Linux builder to catch tests which accidentally require root.\r\n\r\n(but we shouldn't run all builders as non-root, else we'll miss things assuming non-root)\r\n\r\nPerhaps we make some existing weird builder also have this role, like linux-386-387, to not add resources or columns. We could rename it to 386-387noroot if we wanted?\r\n\r\n/cc @minux @adg @crawshaw ",
