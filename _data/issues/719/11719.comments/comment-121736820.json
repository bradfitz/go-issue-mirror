	"body": "EncodeToken expects a value, not a pointer. There is no default case in the type switch, that's why a token with a \"wrong\" type is just ignored. We have different solutions to fix this:\r\n\r\n- option 1: issue an error when the type is invalid (this includes pointers to valid tokens)\r\n- option 2: like 1, but if a pointer is provided, just convert it to a value (one level only), and consider this value.\r\n- option 3: like 1, but if a pointer or an interface is provided, drill down until a value is find, and then consider this value.\r\n\r\nSubmitting a CL to implement option 2, to be changed if another behavior is preferred.\r\n",
