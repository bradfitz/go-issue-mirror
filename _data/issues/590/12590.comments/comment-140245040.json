Without a machine to test, I see two ways this could happen.\r\n\r\nThe first and most likely is that the global constructor ```go_seq_very_init``` in bind/objc/seq_darwin.m is not being called before the global constructor declared in the generated code. I believe these are compiled as separate translation units and so running in the wrong order is entirely possible. (The call order of global constructors is undefined across translation units.)\r\n\r\nThe second possibility is that I believe capturing blocks are saved to stack memory, and only heap allocated on request.\r\n\r\nI wrote a speculative cl/14549, and will test it out tomorrow.",
