So the library must be linking to some extent. But then on the device we get this. On my device it works fine. We're both running ios 8.4.1, but I'm on an iPhone 6 and he's on an iPhone 5.\r\n![screen shot 2015-09-11 at 19 31 46](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1807438/9837009/099baa6c-59fe-11e5-81e2-1223d3488246.png)\r\n\r\nI've found some similar stack overflow issues:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/24690267/exception-break-triggered-by-global-i-a-from-imageloadermachodomodinitfun\r\n\r\nIt seems this stack trace just indicates that something is going wrong when loading an external library, so it might not be of much help. However, I feel that the warning I referred to, to start this issue is relevant. It seems gomobile isn't building Position-Independent code which is required for ios apps. Whether that is what is causing the crash or not, it should be addressed.",
