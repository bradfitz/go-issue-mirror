	"body": "Hi @crawshaw, @hyangah @rakyll  , I found the root of the crash! It seems to be triggered by any publicly declared interface. I came up with the most minimal test below (which causes a crash):\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Copyright 2015 The Go Authors.

So please be aware of this issue and see if you can push a fix through. I am able to change my code to simply not use interfaces and will just use structs.",
