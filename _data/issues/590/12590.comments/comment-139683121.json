It packs them both into a .framework bundle. It doesn't install anything to the host machine, everything you need is in the framework bundle and you must be able to distribute it as it is (in your case, you are distributing it to your coworker's machine).\r\n\r\nCan you send us any stack traces you can gather from the crash time? There is a possibility that the framework bundle is not properly linked against the app your are building and the app is crashing to the missing symbols. Can you double check the Xcode build steps to see if the framework is included?",
