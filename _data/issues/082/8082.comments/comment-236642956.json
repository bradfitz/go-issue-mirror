	"body": "Putting that here for Go2, but I think that implementing such a proposal will add a restriction to the implementation of variant types as bounded interfaces if we ever wished to have them implemented.\r\n\r\nIt would mean than two compatible interfaces can never be used in a variant since the pattern matching (i.e. exhaustive type switch) would be undecidable.\r\nThat can be a fair choice to make, independently of the implementation of this proposal, if one wants to avoid deep nested levels of abstraction anyway.\r\n\r\nJust leaving that here for history.\r\n\r\nRe this exact proposal, it is indeed backward-incompatible. And as @kostya-sh mentionned, the issue is superseded by the issue of package/namespace identification. (not really an issue to me, works as intended).",
