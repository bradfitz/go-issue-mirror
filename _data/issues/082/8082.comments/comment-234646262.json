	"body": "The entire code you pasted strikes me as broken.\r\n\r\nFirst, it's a bad design, because you can't type switch between Uint or Int, nor could you possibly type assert between the two. Both of which one is likely to expect to be able to do.\r\n\r\nThe ONLY way this design works is by passing around anonymous function signatures that take named interfaces. Even a named function type fails: https://play.golang.org/p/ox1KiNdZ7r\r\n\r\nNow, if you had used named function types to begin with, then the anonymous functions would still work as would the specific named-type function.\r\n\r\nIf you want to say that this highly-contrived code constitutes a suicide-pact on the Go1 compatibility guarantee… fine… have at it… enjoy 1.7 and all the people complaining how you broke x/net/context.Context vs context.Context, which is far more likely and larger and more visible impact than breaking type switches on anonymous function types…",
