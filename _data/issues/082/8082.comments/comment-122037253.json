	"body": "A quick note on this issue for anyone that is still watching it: Go \"does the right thing\" if the 2 inner interfaces are declared anonymous. That means the compiler and runtime already support the ability to do the right thing, it's just being overly strict if the interface has a name. Seems that a simple change, to ignore any given name when type checking 2 interfaces, would easily solve this issue.",
