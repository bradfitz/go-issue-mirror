I brought this up before and people rightly pointed out, that there is a tradeoff to be made between strict, theoretical stability and the ability to evolve.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd encourage people to find actual, existing code that gets broken (maybe the BigQuery dataset can help with that, though it's probably a complicated query). Because that's the only way to consider this tradeoff in an informed matter.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd like to see this proposal if we deem it at all possible, for all the reasons mentioned above by others.",
