People appear to be more interested in keeping neigh-impossible, contrived, and broken-in-design code working than ensuring that common-case code moving forward can be written in a sensible manner, rather than with giant hacks everywhere…\r\n\r\nIt's not a matter of gRPC being part of the Go1 compat guarantee; it's about ensuring that common and widely used code can be written compatibly in a forward-looking sensible way, rather than breaking the common case, just because someone can contrive some goat-offal code that wouldn't work after this proposal would be enacted.\r\n\r\n\u003e First, your tone is coming off as very antagonistic.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Open Source, if you don't like it, there's the door. I mean, if you weren't listen to me before, then why should I care about my rhetoric now? What are you going to do? Doubly reject my argument? Or reject it more sternly?\r\n\r\nThere's literally nothing you can do to me that hasn't already been done… even banning me from participating in the project doesn't matter at this point… why would I stay a part of a community that won't consider reasonable arguments in favor of technicalities and horrible, _horrible_ code?",
