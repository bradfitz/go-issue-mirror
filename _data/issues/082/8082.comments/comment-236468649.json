Please add your comments there. Concentrating comments on one proposal will show community support better.\r\n\r\nAs issue #16209 has been closed as a duplicate of this issue, would you mind updating the title of this issue to include the `proposal:` prefix and add the relevant [proposal tag](https://github.com/golang/go/labels/Proposal)? This will make it easier for the community to become involved in the ongoing discussion. As this proposal also solves many of the problems related to move of the `x/net/context` package, it would be very interesting to discuss this proposal in tandem with the alias proposal (#16339).",
