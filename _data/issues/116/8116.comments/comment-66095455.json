An untyped constant takes on the type expected by\nits context.  When you write float64(1), the untyped 1 is converted to float64.  In a\nshift operation, since the right operand of the shift is always an unsigned integer\ntype, this applies to the left operand of the shift.  As the spec says: \"If the left\noperand of a non-constant shift expression is an untyped constant,\nthe type of the constant is what it would be if the shift expression were\nreplaced by its left operand alone.\"  In this case, float64(1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; width) means that\nthe 1 is converted to float64.  So this is equivalent to float64(1) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; width.  And\ntherefore you get an error about shifting a value of floating point type.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
