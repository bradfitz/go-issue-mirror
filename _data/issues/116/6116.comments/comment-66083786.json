It just says a pointer\ncan be converted to/from an unsafe.Pointer. However, an example defines it as\n*ArbitraryType, as does the definition in the library docs. Thus, I claim that\nunsafe.Pointer is a pointer and thus this is WorkingAsIntended.\n\nReopen if you disagree, but I think it's reasonably clear.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
