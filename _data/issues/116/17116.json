	"body": "I've tried to build a mobile package for ios, and was surprised to get strange compilation errors. It turned out that even though I specified `--target=ios`, the tags used during build was empty. After specifying explicitly `--tags=ios` too beside the target, compilation succeeded correctly. My guess is that some refactor broke this as I remember seeing commits in the code adding the `ios` tag.",
