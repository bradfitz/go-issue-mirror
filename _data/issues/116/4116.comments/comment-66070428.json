I certainly would\nlike to see every Go user switch to 1.1 the day it ships. My concern is this tag may\nencourage users to not upgrade to 1.1 when it ships and instead waste time developing\nelaborate backport packages.\n\nThis is not to say there is not a package/api versioning problem on the horizon. This\ntag is one facet of it, the debian/distro problem is another, but I worry that a go1.1\ntag sets a precident for the go 1.2 tag, or worse, the go 1.1.2 tag.\u003c/pre\u003e",
