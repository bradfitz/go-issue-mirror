Yes, they should be rare, but any use of +build tags should\nbe rare. The argument against the build tag is to avoid fragmentation,\nbut the build tag is not the cause of the fragmentation. API additions\nor other changes are what cause fragmentation. The build tag provides\na way for conscientious Go developers to keep people using older\nversions of Go happy.\n\nThere is a claim here that the only people using Go 1.0 are Debian\nusers. I don't think that's true at all. During a transition period\nfollowing the initial release of Go 1.1 there will be people who want\ntime to evaluate Go 1.1 in their own production environments before\nmaking the switch, and it would be good to provide a way for authors\nof third-party libraries to keep their code Go 1.0-compatible during\nthat transition. I expect that a thorough customer might wait as long\nas six to twelve months before switching, depending on how well Go 1.1\nworks and how many point releases it takes to correct whatever tricky\ncorner cases they run into.\n\nI agree completely with the ideal of not needing a go1.1 tag. But I\nthink the situation is not ideal, and so we need it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
