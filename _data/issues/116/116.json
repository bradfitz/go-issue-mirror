	"body": "by **abryzak**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe test/run shell script replaces the entire path on line 35 rather than \nsupplementing it. This causes the test script to fail outputting results if \nsome environment variables are set that alter behaviour of standard \ncommands and the system ones don't support the options.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Install latest GNU grep using macports\n2. Export GREP_OPTIONS='--exclude-dir=\\.svn' (I have this in my \n.bash_profile)\n3. Run test/run\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nI expect (according to installation instructions):\n--- cd ../test\nN known bugs; 0 unexpected bugs\n\nI see:\ngrep: unrecognized option `--exclude-dir=.svn'\nUsage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...\nTry `grep --help' for more information.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\ndarwin/amd64\n\nWhich revision are you sync'ed to?  (hg log -l 1)\n3975:b51fd2d6c160\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI could just change my environment variables to avoid this problem but I \nfeel the test script should either adjust the PATH rather than replace it, or \nreset the environment to a known state.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/116/0/path-adjusted.patch\"\u003epath-adjusted.patch\u003c/a\u003e (316 bytes)",
