If pipeline in the above spec is a pointer to a bool that is false, then false and it is an empty value and T1 should not be executed and is not executed under the current behavior.  But should it not be the case that {{if not pipeline}} T1 {{end}} in the same scenario result in T1 being executed? Execution should happen inside out, first pipeline which dereferences the pointer, then logical not, then if, the truthiness check.  What am I missing?",
