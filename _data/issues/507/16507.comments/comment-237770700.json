You have mentioned \"SHCreateMemStream\", but I have never used that function. What is the problem that you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nAnd you can do it now. You can copy syscall.GetProcAddress and change the function to pass integer to syscall.Syscall instead of string. I just don't see how this can be used to justify us adding this functionality even in golang.org/x/sys/windows.\r\n\r\nAlex",
