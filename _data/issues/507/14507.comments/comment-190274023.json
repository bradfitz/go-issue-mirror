	"body": "typedmemmove is itself generic.  So I guess one test/branch in typedmemmove would ensure that both the source and destination are aligned and could call a specialized memmove routine.  We can do the same thing in memmove itself with an or/test/branch.  Doesn't seem like a big win.\r\n\r\nI agree with your size feelings.  It's more important for Go to get the 1 and 2 word memmoves fast.  Of course it depends a lot on the benchmark.",
