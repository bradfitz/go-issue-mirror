Calls for string \u003c-\u003e []byte\r\n4. Calls for compiler-generated copying of big user types\r\n\r\n#1,#2, and #4 are almost always aligned.  Although very likely, I think we could only guarantee it at #2 and #4 callsites.  Alignment in case #3 is less likely.\r\nFor #2 and #4, the copies are typically large so a test and branch for alignment wouldn't add much relative cost.\r\n",
