It could then also use AppendInt instead of\nItoa, saving a few more allocations.\n\nI don't believe the client is that slow. I think you're just exercising the code by\nallocating a lot. I don't think there's a runtime bug here. \n\nYou might want to try mailing the golang-nuts@googlegroups.com mailing list and point\nthem to this issue so they can look at the graphs and code and make suggestions.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
