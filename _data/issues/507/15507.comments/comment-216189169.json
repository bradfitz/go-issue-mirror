What if the source code in GOPATH is not coming from a VSC or coming from Subversion that supports checking out a directory?\r\n- if a repository contains multiple public binaries then it is not necessary to copy dependencies multiple times. vendored dependencies can be placed under cmd/vendor.\r\n- As far as I can tell this proposal doesn't solve \"library and program in the same repository\" problem.",
