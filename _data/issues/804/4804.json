	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIt is very unintuitive that Open() does not directly open a connection to the database.\nInstead the first connection is opened when the database is actually used the first time\n(first query).\n\nOften people try to catch errors on Open() (wrong password, server not running etc) but\nthis doesn't work.\n\nThe database/sql package should either actually open a connection on Open() or at least\nit should be documented that it does not.\u003c/pre\u003e",
