Perhaps file could link to that description and\nexplicitly state the fact that no io.EOF error is returned when n \u003e 0 (the io\ndescription specifies that either may happen).\n\nPerhaps this should be a different issue, but I'm confused by \" and callers should treat\nthat situation as a no-op\" that is the last sentence of the io.Reader description. Is\nthat just saying there should be a check like\n\nif bytesLeftInReader == 0{\n\treturn 0, io.EOF\n}\n?\u003c/pre\u003e",
