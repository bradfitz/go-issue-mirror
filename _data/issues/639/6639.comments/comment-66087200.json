The File.Read method doesn't get a\npointer to the slice, so it wouldn't even be possible for the Read method to truncate it.\n\nFor reference, the io.Reader docs are more clear: \u003ca href=\"http://tip.golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader\"\u003ehttp://tip.golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat's not clear is whether the File.Read docs are trying to promise a tighter contract\nthan io.Reader.Read itself.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **documentation**._",
