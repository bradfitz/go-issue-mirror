	"body": "These problems are happening because the duktape library calls setjmp and longjmp.  When calling C code from Go, you can only use setjmp/longjmp within a single C call that does not make any intervening Go calls.  Specifically, the call to ctx.RequireNumber is failing and trying to call longjmp to a setjmp that occurred before calling back into Go to invoke func.  That can't work.  The longjmp is skipping over the intervening Go code.\r\n\r\nI think the status right now is that you can use duktape from Go as long as you are careful to not cause any errors.  I recommend modifying the duktape code to crash on error rather than calling longjmp.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue because I don't think there is anything we can do to fix it.",
