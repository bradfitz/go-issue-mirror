	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe current description for file.Read is \n\n\u0026quot;Read reads up to len(b) bytes from the File. It returns the number of bytes read\nand an error, if any. EOF is signaled by a zero count with err set to io.EOF.\u0026quot;\n\nI found the second sentence confusing. I read it to mean \u0026quot;If the end of the file is\nreached, n will be set to zero and err will be set to io.EOF\u0026quot; which is not the\nactual behavior. Could you change the wording to be something like \n\n\u0026quot;Read reads up to len(b) bytes from the File. It returns the number of bytes read\nand an error, if any occurred. If the end of the file is reached, the number of bytes\nread will be less than the length of the buffer. The buffer will not be truncated. If no\nbytes are read, err is set to io.EOF, otherwise no error will be signaled\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e",
