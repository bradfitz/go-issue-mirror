	"body": "Thanks to Kyle Isom for fuzzing and finding that it's possible to panic encoding/asn1.Unmarshal when ASN.1 data is truncated after an explicit tag.\r\n\r\nThis can affect the parsing of various ASN.1 structures, most importantly X.509 certificates. TLS servers without client-authentication enabled (which is the vast majority of them) should be unaffected. Also, even with client-authentication enabled, calling code often catches and handles any panics.\r\n\r\nTLS clients can be forced into panicking if the server sends a suitably crafted certificate.
