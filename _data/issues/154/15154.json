	"body": "Currently, `readSlice` method in `bytes.Buffer` is private, which means there is no easy way to read the buffer by delimiter without needlessly allocating another slice.\r\n\r\nSince it is already there, and [bufio package has the same method exported](https://golang.org/pkg/bufio/#Reader.ReadSlice), I propose making this method exported in the `bytes` package as well (with proper warnings about its usage in the comments, the same way `bufio` does it).\r\n\r\nI can submit a patch, but since I'm not sure whether these kind of changes are acceptable (it is non-breaking change, right?), I'd rather ask first.",
