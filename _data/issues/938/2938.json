This does not seem to be the case.\n\nThe attached program can be run with the arguments ss is si ii to select a transfer from\nand to a struct or an interface. Additionally, the argument reg will register the\nstructure with gob, but that does not change anything.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. compile the attached file\n2. run it with options ss and is -- no error message.\n3. run it with options si or ii -- error message from gob. \n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nNo error message in case 3.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\ndecoding error gob: wrong type received for local value main.Mer: Foo = struct { Bar\nstring; Beque string; }\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nMacOS X Lion\n\nWhich revision are you using?
