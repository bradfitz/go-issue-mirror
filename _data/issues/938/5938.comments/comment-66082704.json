If there is any chance that you somebody could at least\nconfirm they are also having the issue on their machine then maybe somebody might be\nwilling to look into this deeper?\n\nI suspect it's certain page sources that are causing the issue, which is why I couldn't\nreplicate it just parsing the same url over and over, and unfortunately couldn't come up\nwith a smaller test case for everyone.\u003c/pre\u003e",
