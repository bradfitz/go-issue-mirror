Noting it\nhere so that I don't forget about it.\n\n\u0026quot;The result, which we call goroutines, can be very cheap: unless they spend a lot\nof time in long-running system calls, they cost little more than the memory for the\nstack, which is just a few kilobytes.\u0026quot;\n\nWhy does it matter whether a goroutine spends a lot of time in a long-running system\ncall?  I don't see why that changes the cost one way or another.  I can see a suggestion\nthat making a lot of system calls can be expensive, but why \u0026quot;long-running system\ncalls?\u0026quot;\u003c/pre\u003e",
