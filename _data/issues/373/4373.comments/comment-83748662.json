Closing a connection locally in order to stop a service\r\n\r\nIn both cases, my goroutine is blocked on a Read() and errors out with an `*errors.errorString` with the text \"use of closed network connection\".\r\n\r\nIn both use cases, I want to be able to detect these errors as io.EOF (use case 1) or io.ErrClosed (use case 2) and handle them accordingly.  With the current errClosing, I can't cleanly detect the error and if the error message were to change, my code wouldn't detect it.\r\n",
