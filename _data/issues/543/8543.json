	"body": "\u003cpre\u003esync.WaitGroup docs say \u0026quot;Note that calls with positive delta must happen before the\ncall to Wait, or else Wait may wait for too small a group.\u0026quot;\n\nThis is notoriously confusing. Given\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/8054?c=10\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/8054?c=10\u003c/a\u003e :\n\n\u0026quot;The rule for WaitGroup is: all Add's that can transition the counter from 0 to\n\u0026gt;0 must happen before Wait. Add's with negative values, or Add's with positive values\nwhich start when counter \u0026gt;0 can be executed at any time.\u0026quot;\n\n\nIf that really is the guarantee, could the documentation be changed to state that? As\nis, people read that \u0026quot;calls\u0026quot; as \u0026quot;all calls\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;at least one\ncall\u0026quot;, and those lead to very different behavior.\u003c/pre\u003e",
