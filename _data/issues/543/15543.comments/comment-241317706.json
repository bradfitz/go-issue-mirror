	"body": "The expected rounding mode is To Nearest Even - that's the only default that makes sense. I'm pretty sure a lot of things would break if that changed. For instance, some of the math/big.Float tests assume that float32/64 are rounded that way (and it's tested against big.Floats with that rounding mode).\r\n\r\nI don't know that C or C++ say much about float rounding but I'd be surprised if things wouldn't break if the mode is changed. Probably the same for Java.\r\n\r\nI have a vague memory that we talked about that in the long past and the conclusion was that all bets are off if a piece of code (Go or anywhere else) changes the rounding mode. Or in other words: if some code changes it locally, it better changes it back.",
