I used your instructions, along with the wingui\nproject to create an interface layer to ODBC using entirely syscall and no cgo.  It was\na difficult but rewarding experience and I learned alot.  Once I get the chance to\nverify my code a bit more, I plan on posting it to go-lang nuts for a peer review to get\nfeedback from others.\u003c/pre\u003e",
