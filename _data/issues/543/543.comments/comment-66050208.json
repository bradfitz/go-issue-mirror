Sysmon() thread detects when an M runs the same\ngoroutine for a long time and sets m-\u003egcwaiting. When a thread notices m-\u003egcwaiting, it\ncalls into scheduler. If global gcwaiting is not set, it just causes rescheduling. This\nway worker threads be preempted on chan/map/malloc operations.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @dvyukov._",
