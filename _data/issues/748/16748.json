	"body": "A common antipattern I see in production code is using `reflect.DeepEqual` on errors in tests, which results in brittle tests.  Even just adding more diagnostic information to the error can break it.  The more proper thing to do is either:\r\n\r\n1. Check whether a substring is present in the error message (not great, but more correct).\r\n2. Use something like Dave Cheney's [errors package](https://github.com/pkg/errors) to make the system-under-test provide more useful errors (great! because it's better API design anyway).\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to have a vet check that discourages this.\r\n\r\n(cc @dsnet)",
