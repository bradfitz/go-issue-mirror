	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThese functions must create a small byte buffer\nand then call w.Write(buf).  Since nothing can be\nassumed about the behavior of an arbitrary io.Writer,\nthis buffer is always going to be allocated.\nThus, this API is not possible to make efficient.\nI suggest deleting it.  It is unused except in tests.\nCallers can instead use PutVarint on their own buffer\nand then call w.Write.  There is no need for a gofix.\n\nReadUvarint and ReadVarint are also unused except\nin tests but they are efficient and provide functionality\nthat cannot be simulated in other ways, because they\ntake care to read as few bytes as possible to return an\nanswer.  I believe they should stay.\u003c/pre\u003e",
