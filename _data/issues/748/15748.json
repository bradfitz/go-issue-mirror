	"body": "In https://github.com/golang/go/commit/585590549a3c6e26e7963081e11478a1913744a6 the interface-like Transport.Dial was deprecated for a new Transport.Dialer which is a concrete *net.Dialer.\r\n\r\nI understand Transport.Dial will remain but as seen in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12737 and https://github.com/golang/go/issues/14221 it might be preferable in the long run to use something interface-based. Only DialContext is used on the new Transport.Dialer.\r\n\r\nBefore this goes out in 1.7 would it be worthwhile to change from a concrete *net.Dialer to either:\r\n\r\n* having Transport.Dialer be interface { DialContext(ctx context.Context, network, addr string) }\r\n* keeping only Transport.Dial but using DialContext on it if it implements the above interface?",
