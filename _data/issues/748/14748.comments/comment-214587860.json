	"body": "We agree that *implements* and *referrers* should be restricted by a scope flag whose default is `...`.\r\n\r\nI maintain that this must be a different flag from the `-scope` flag that governs the pointer analysis, because most users do not want to restrict *implements* and *referrers*, but all users must restrict the pointer analysis.  I reluctantly conclude we need a second scope flag.\r\n\r\nWhat should the two flags be called?  If compatibility were no concern, I would propose `-ptascope` and `-scope`, with the former defaulting to \"nothing\" and the latter defaulting to \"everything\".  (Some of the query modes that use pointer analysis can be altered to work without a scope, at least some of the time.  For example, a *callers* query for an unexported function that is not address-taken doesn't need pointer analysis, and *callers* could simply print an \"incomplete results; set -ptascope\" warning for other cases.)\r\n\r\nI would generally not be concerned with compatibility just yet, but this week both vim-go and GoSublime announced their new support for the Guru.\r\n\r\n",
