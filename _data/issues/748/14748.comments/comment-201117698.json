All -scope really means is \"consider these\n\u003e packages when doing queries`.\n\u003e\n\nWell, sort of.  The pointer analysis scope is really an optimization\nbecause computing PTA for the entire workspace is prohibitively expensive,\nbut if it was free I would have -scope=... all the time so that I never\nhave to think about updating my scope as I switch from one program to\nanother.  The implements/referrers queries are much cheaper than PTA\n(relatively) and generate results in streaming fashion, making it feasible\nand useful to have -scope=... for medium or even large-sized workspaces.\n\n\nI'd prefer not to have arbitrary limits to the amount of reports or\n\u003e packages. That would ultimately need a \"give me everything\" flag when I\n\u003e need the 101st package.\n\u003e\nAgreed.  Each additional flag is a UI nightmare when there's an editor in\nthe way.  I like simply providing a stream of results and letting the user\nkill the task when they've had enough. :)\n",
