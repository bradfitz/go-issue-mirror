	"body": "From the standpoint of a purist, I can see why you'd want two different flags. I, however, believe that it requires less mental overhead to manage one flag instead of two. As a user, I don't really care about pointer analysis. I mostly care about how fast an operation is, and what results I get. I think it would be a lot easier to change a scope between \"...\" and something more restrictive whenever needed, instead of having to set two flags and understand which one applies to which operation.\r\n\r\nIn particular when you say that some modes *sometimes* don't need PTA and sometimes do that really causes confusion. PTA isn't something most people think about, or know for that matter. They'd like a query to work. If it's too slow, they'll restrict the scope. If it doesn't cover everything they care about, they expand the scope. The way I see it, having two flags has only two advantages: 1) Purity 2) Not having to change one of the flags as often. I don't think that 1 is worth it, and 2 can be fixed in the UI instead (provide a toggle between \"all\" and \"last value\", for example).",
