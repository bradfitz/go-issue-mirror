There's no guarantee that ListenAndServeTLS will be\nrunning by the time client.Get runs.\n\ninit runs first, but the goroutine that it starts isn't guaranteed to start running\nbefore TestHttps.\n\nI bet if you add a time.Sleep at the beginning of TestHttps it \"works\", but that's a\nhacky solution.\n\nThe better solution is to start listening first with a new net.Listener, then start a\nserving goroutine (using the listener you already started), and *then* make your HTTP\nrequest.\n\nOr just use:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://weekly.golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptest/#NewTLSServer\"\u003ehttp://weekly.golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptest/#NewTLSServer\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Invalid**._",
