See the attached file.\nI understand it's probably considerad bad and non-idiomatic go-code but it illustrates\nthat it's indeed possible to reconstruct an interface-value without\nswitch/case-statements or equivalent.\n\nBtw, I really appreciate the swift response and all your efforts in making go a truly\nremarkable language!\n\n/Christian\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5220/7/weak.go\"\u003eweak.go\u003c/a\u003e (2012 bytes)",
