At least my intuition about assignment rules are either\nbased on soundness, e.g. covariance and such, or related to direct incompatibility. \nThe specification is great but the reasons for certain decisions are even more important\nimo. In this particular case I presume it's not related to type-system soundness but\nrather implementation and performance related.\u003c/pre\u003e",
