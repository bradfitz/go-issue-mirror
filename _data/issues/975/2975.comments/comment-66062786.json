You need to make sure your builder is update, including latest fix I sent for\nreview recently: \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/5649074/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/5649074/\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nPerhaps it is a way you execute it, but there is nothing to it. I run it from Windows\ncommand prompt. Just make sure you have gcc binaries in the PATH. Nothing else needed.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
