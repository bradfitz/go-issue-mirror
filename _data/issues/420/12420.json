	"body": "My company has tried to adopt a convention placing import paths into three groups: standard library followed by third-party packages followed by local packages. For example\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport (\r\n\t\"database/sql\"\r\n\t\"io\"\r\n\t\"strconv\"\r\n\r\n\t\"github.com/lib/pq\"\r\n\r\n\t\"mycompany.com/foo/bar\"\r\n\t\"mycompany.com/foo/baz\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'd like to be able to add a flag to our goimports-on-save hook, like\r\n\r\n```\r\ngoimports -local mycompany.com/\r\n```\r\n\r\nto tell goimports to put any paths beginning with \"mycompany.com/\" into our third group. I think that would end up as group value 3 in the goimports source: stdlib=0, 3rd party=1, appengine=2, then local=3.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds reasonable, I can write a patch.",
