	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhen creating a cbc encrypter/decrypter it doesn't check for nil iv (for example, I was\nexpecting it to use \u0026quot;default\u0026quot; iv of all zeros in that case), and causes a\nconfusing panic much later, when calling CryptBlocks. Post Go 1 it would likely be\nbetter to:\n\n- (optional) check iv for nil and use make([]byte, BlockSize) to create a\n\u0026quot;zero\u0026quot; iv\n- panic if iv size is less than BlockSize, so it is clear where is the actual error\u003c/pre\u003e",
