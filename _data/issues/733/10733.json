Perhaps if -u were given it would make sense to show them? \n\n\tg% go doc cover\n\tpackage main // import \"cmd/cover\"\n\t\n\tCover is a program for analyzing the coverage profiles generated by 'go test\n\t-coverprofile=cover.out'.\n\t\n\tCover is also used by 'go test -cover' to rewrite the source code with\n\tannotations to track which parts of each function are executed. It operates on\n\tone Go source file at a time, computing approximate basic block information by\n\tstudying the source. It is thus more portable than binary-rewriting coverage\n\ttools, but also a little less capable. For instance, it does not probe inside \u0026\u0026\n\tand || expressions, and can be mildly confused by single statements with\n\tmultiple function literals.\n\t\n\tFor usage information, please see:\n\t\n\t\tgo help testflag\n\t\tgo tool cover -help\n\t\n\tfunc ParseProfiles(fileName string) ([]*Profile, error)\n\ttype Block struct { ... }\n\ttype Boundary struct { ... }\n\ttype File struct { ... }\n\ttype FuncExtent struct { ... }\n\ttype FuncVisitor struct { ... }\n\ttype Profile struct { ... }\n\ttype ProfileBlock struct { ... }\n\tg%",
