I think almost no one thinks about `gofmt` as \"a tool that fixes patterns that betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the language\", `gofmt` is \"that thing that formats go code in an uniform way\". Even if you look at the simplifications made by `gofmt -s`, you only see really really lightweight transformations, mostly syntactic-cosmetic changes. Removing a clause from a boolean expression is a really different thing, IMHO.\r\n\r\n \u003e It can be coded with no false positives (again more like gofmt, less like golint)\r\n\r\nThe fact that `golint` can generate false positives does not imply that something that does **not** generate false positives is ill-fitted for `golint`.",
