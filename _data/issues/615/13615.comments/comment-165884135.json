	"body": "Am unable to upgrade the Linux version (2.6.33-rc4) on the target platform due to legacy issues.  The same code when run on other Linux versions (different platform) works flawlessly.\r\nThere are documented changes to address futex issues on Linux version 2.6.33-rc7.  At this point it seems most likely that Linux is the source of the problem.  However it seems very odd that only the os/exec function is affected.\r\nThere is a workaround to avoid using the os/exec function on the target application and that will have be utilized until such time as the root cause is found.\r\nThank you all for your prompt, courteous and knowledgeable replies.\r\n",
