I\nthink your suggestion to treat links to \"golang.org\" might be a pragmatic solution to\nthe problem. It would make the local godoc server work even better in offline mode.\n\nReally, this is one of the truly awesome features of godoc. I've often been surprised\nthat I have been working offline without knowing it, since godoc provides a lot of the\ninformation I need without even requiring access to the Internet.\u003c/pre\u003e",
