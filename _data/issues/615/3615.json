	"body": "by **damoxc**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI'm currently attempting to implement an existing API using the built-in go rpc package\nand stumbled at not being able to keep the same method names as before they were in the\nform:\n\ncore.hello_world\n\nand as far as I can tell it's only possible to have with the the go rpc package:\n\ncore.HelloWorld\n\nThe attached patch adds support to method aliasing to the rpc server in a very naive and\nsimple way. Feel free to ignore this completely!\u003c/pre\u003e",
