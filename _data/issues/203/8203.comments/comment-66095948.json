So which are you suggesting; a)\nParseRoutingSockaddr should parse SockaddrDatalink, b) ParseRoutingSockaddr should not\nparse prefix state change announcements that hold only prefix mask, c) both of a and b,\nd) other.\n\nI'm fine with (a) but am not keen on other.\n\nP.S. I'd recommend you to capture not only RTM_{NEW,DEL}ADDR but RTM_{NEW,DEL}ROUTE for\ndealing with network facility (especially link and its belongings) changes on Darwin. On\nother BSDs, interface announcements (a series of IFAN_XXX messages) would be great help.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/8203/3/soso.go\"\u003esoso.go\u003c/a\u003e (1894 bytes)",
