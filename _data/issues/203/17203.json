	"body": "One of the most painful points of developing mobile applications, is that you need to use a physical device or emulator to preview any and all changes to the app.\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if gomobile could produce desktop binaries where one could preview the app before deploying to the mobile phone. Essentially one would add another backend (for instance, using the linux X server) that implements the gomobile app interface.\r\n\r\nIs this feature on gomobile's roadmap?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
