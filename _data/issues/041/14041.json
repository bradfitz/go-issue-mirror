	"body": "Currently `go tool pprof` in interactive mode doesn't support readline features such as command history, ctrl-r, tab-completion, etc. It would be great to add such functionality.\r\n\r\nBasic integration is quite easy - see [the gist](https://gist.github.com/valyala/37bd2c3f50a1235702d5) containing PoC readline patch for `go tool pprof`. It is based on [pure go implementation of readline](https://github.com/chzyer/readline).",
