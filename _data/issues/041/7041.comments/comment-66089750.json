Plus your diagnosis is wrong, at least here.\n\nThere are two packages in that directory.\n\nIf you name a directory, vet walks the directory a file at a time and no package-level\ntype-checking can be done. It makes no attempt to break the list of files into separate\npackages. Instead it treats each file separately, ignoring errors (because there will be\nsome.) Thus when it encounters the scan_test.go problem, IsSpace is indeed not defined.\n\nIf you name a list of files, it treats them as a single package and checks them together\nas a unit.\n\nIf you instead run\n  go tool vet $HOME/go/src/pkg/bufio/*.go\nyou'll see the behavior I think you expect. If you run\n  go vet bufio\nyou'll see the behavior you really want, which is just to check the bufio package.\n\nThe only thing I see wrong here is that the documentation about directories could use\nsome clarification. But the short answer is: use go vet, not go tool vet.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
