	"body": "This is not necessary, but would be very useful because at the moment the times reported for each test can *not* add up to the times reported per package. I am OK with reducing package time output to two digits of precision as well, or just changing this to output three digits. It seems from [this](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/go/test.go#L43-L50) Godoc that this behavior may even be a bug.\r\n\r\nIt is nice to be able to parse `go test` output to jUnit XML or the like and keep timeline data of test runs in Jenkins, for instance. When *most* tests fall under the 10ms time, they all appear as 0s. This is not useful. Given that the *only* reason the format is what it is at the moment is that the formatting directive on a `Printf` is chosen to have two significant digits, and the more precise data is already present, I can't see a good argument for not allowing it to be expressed.",
