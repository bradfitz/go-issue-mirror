	"body": " I was attempting to get a nice breakdown of \"how much time is spent doing what\" during a full test run, and tests with zero timing are not useful there. When I first looked I expected the reason for only displaying two digits of precision was a limitation in the timing mechanism, but since `time.Since` was used I wasn't sure why the output of `time.Duration.String()` wasn't used for this field and instead the time was formatted.  If the purpose of that time slot is to find long-running tests, then I am misusing the feature. In that case, I'll close this issue.",
