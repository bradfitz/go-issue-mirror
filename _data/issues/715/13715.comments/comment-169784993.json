For that 2 decimal digits is more than enough.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you're using these timings for.  You mentioned parsing the test output to jUnit.  But then you said the 0 times were annoying, implying a human is reading them, not a program.\r\n\r\nIf a program is reading them, just ignore the 0 entries.  If a human is reading them, do they really care (or notice) that the times don't add up?\r\n\r\nEven with 3 digits of precision, simple tests are probably still going to report 0 time.",
