	"body": "Although I agree that this may not be the ideal way to propose new APIs (or report API bugs), mailing out samples are not ideal either. Gesture detection algorithms are well known algorithms that require event time and identification of events (which will be supported once https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/1895/ is submitted).\r\n\r\nI want to detect whether user double tapped or not. I shouldn't be reimplementing the event listener to expose event IDs and their timestamps to mail out a sample in order to justify this proposal.\r\n\r\nFor reference, some of the popular gesture detectors are available on https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/ndk/sources/android/ndk_helper/gestureDetector.cpp.",
