I've heard of cases where AAAA queries return REFUSED or SERVFAIL, but no response at all is pretty harsh.\r\n\r\nIt's prevalent enough that Ubuntu documentation talks about it: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4\r\n\r\nAlso lots of people online [talking about it](http://serverfault.com/questions/632665/how-to-disable-aaaa-lookups)\r\n\r\n\u003e Can you suggest a list? Note that only resolvers exposing \"Lookup A+AAAA\" as a single operation are in scope for this issue.\r\n\r\nWell, the obvious starting set is Darwin, recent GNU libc, and Windows.",
