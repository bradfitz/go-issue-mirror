MAP_FIXED happily overwrites any existing mappings.\nefence significantly increases heap size (as virtual addresses are not reused).\nAs the result, in small 32-bit address space, heap eventually overlaps with other\nallocations (e.g. MSpan), overwrites them and corrupts.\n\nSo I would say that this is more efence-specific. But strictly saying nothing prevents\nit from happening w/o efence (esp if you have very large heap).\n\nIt's not the time to refactor it for 1.3. Moving to 1.4.\nRuss, do you agree?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.4**, removed **release-go1.3**._",
