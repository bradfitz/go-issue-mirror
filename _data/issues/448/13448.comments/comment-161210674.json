	"body": "The bad email client that I mentioned most probably is using different non-Golang library for composing the email. I don't have any knowledge on the mail client but just our application received a raw email with this type of bad formatted Content-Type.\r\n\r\nYa, before I posted I did doubt about whether Golang team will even consider this. I just try it. You may not violent the RFC by still returning the error, just different type of error. But currently mime library *return \"\", nil, error* [check this](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/mime/mediatype.go#L137) which wipe out any of the previously successfully parsed mediatype and params.\r\n\r\nIt would be easier if other email client give error for the same type of email but Thunderbird and some other mail client can read the email. But our email client application can not because we use Golang library to parse the email.\r\n\r\nAnyway feel free to close it. There is always others workaround. Thank for the time.",
