I suspect the problem is that `Glob` is being used to traverse a large directory tree.\r\n\r\nI don't think it makes sense to add a `context.Context` argument to `Glob`, though.  If it's really necessary to cancel the directory traversal, then I think `Glob` is probably the wrong function to call.  The program should call a different function that streams the files to a channel (and takes a `Context` argument).  I don't know that that function belongs in the standard library.",
