I am new to golang, but there is a small proposal.\r\nI don`t know how this affects other parts, may be you will help understand them.\r\nLook at this sample of code: http://play.golang.org/p/ik8RK3p5i7\r\n\r\nSeems like compiler doesn`t understand that should return two arguments instead of\r\ns := m[\"A\"] syntax.\r\n\r\nCommented code works fine, but is a bit ugly.\r\nLooks like backward-compatible change for me.\r\n",
