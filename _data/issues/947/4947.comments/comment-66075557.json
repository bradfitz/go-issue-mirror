I thought the purpose of this\nissue was to avoid the function call overhead, and now instead we're\ntalking about shaving nanoseconds by making the atomics API 10x bigger. I\nam still willing to avoid the function call overhead. I am much less\nenthusiastic about adding new semantics. I don't think we should at all,\nand certainly not before Go 1.2.\n\nPut another way, I don't see why we should support so many more operations\nhere than we do in package sync/atomic.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
