If the current runtime\natomics can be made intrinsics without expanding the API, and this actually does\nrepresent significant advantage, I still sounds like it's worth it.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4947/24/jswn395.png\"\u003ejswn395.png\u003c/a\u003e (99908 bytes)",
