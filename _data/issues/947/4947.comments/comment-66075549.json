Currently we\nhave to use XCHG always.\n\nRELAXED vs non-RELAXED can significantly affect register allocation, for RELAXED there\nis no need to dump/restore registers. There are lots of fast-path checks that only need\nRELAXED load (e.g. does global runq empty? does chan has any recv waiters?)\n\nI am not saying about ARM that needs dmb; op; dmb for SEQ_CST operations.\n\nPrecise memory ordering constraints also improve code readability by making the intent\nclear and will help with any formal verification.\u003c/pre\u003e",
