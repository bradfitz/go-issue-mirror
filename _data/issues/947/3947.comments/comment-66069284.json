I realized that the benchmark uses a\nsingle connection for all requests. That's why it show great contention on the\nconnection. At least we must take into account other cases - several high-throughput\nconnections, a lot of connections with low activity.\nPerhaps a program that is meant to use a single connection  can just use several\nconnections and manual load-balancing to reduce contention.\u003c/pre\u003e",
