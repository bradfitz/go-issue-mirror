So I reject the argument that this will complicate porting of large code bases between compilers.\r\n\r\nThis is not, in my opinion, a worthwhile diagnostic.  The gc compiler implements it to simplify its own internal handling of untyped constants.\r\n\r\nThe only possible principled approach is for all compilers to implement the complete language described in the spec.  The spec permits large shift counts.  Therefore the compilers should too.  But, again, no actual code is going to use this, so it doesn't matter that gc rejects it.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is anything to do here.",
