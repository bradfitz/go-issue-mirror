	"body": "There appears to be a confusion (at least to me) on what the appropriate receiver type ought to be by default. \r\nLooking at; https://tour.golang.org/methods/8 \r\nThat tutorial encourages new go users that: \r\n`There are two reasons to use a pointer receiver.`\r\n`The first is so that the method can modify the value that its receiver points to.`\r\n`The second is to avoid copying the value on each method call.` \r\n\r\nthis seems to imply that you should default to using pointer receivers in only those two cases. \r\nwhereas looking at; https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#receiver-type and a few other credible go sources eg; https://twitter.com/rob_pike/status/788743046280077313 \r\nwe see that actually, pointer receivers should be the default while value receivers are the exception. \r\n\r\nSo to summarize; the tour.golang notes makes it appear as if pointer receivers are the exception(that was my impression when I went through those notes as a new go user some months back) whereas in actual sense they are (or ought to be) the default.
