I'm also open to delete those constants in\nx/sys/unix, but we have to keep those in the syscall package.\n\n2. move affected functions from auto-generated zsyscall\nfile into a linux/arm specific file, and implement them correctly.\n\n3. For x/sys/unix only, consider adding tests for syscalls that\nare straightforward to test. For example, we can test time.Now()\nand unix.Time agrees with each other. The test should be\ngeneric so that it runs on all linux platforms (not only arm).\n",
