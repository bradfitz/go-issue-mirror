	"body": "Those SYS_* constants are still correct, it's just they\ncan't be used by the current kernel, so leave them as\nthey are. The syscall numbers are currently automatically\ngenerated, so it probably hard to add comments to\nthose numbers, but I think most people will use existing\nfunctions rather than calling Syscall directly anyway, so\nit probably won't affect much.\n\nJust fix the implementation to use the correct syscalls.\n\nFor the functions in syscall package, I think if the fix\nis simple, we can fix those functions. The syscall package\nis to serve the standard library, that's the reason why\nwe don't extend it anymore, but existing bugs should\nstill be fixed, IMO.\n",
