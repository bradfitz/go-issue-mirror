Is there a large number of people who both want to stick with official releases but want to do that via git?\r\n\r\nHaving a long-running `release` branch ends up a bit messy with all the merging, particularly when files are added/deleted. If the release tags aren't going to be pointing to commits on the `release` branch then the people using that branch won't be using the exact proper releases. My concern is that there's going to be an ongoing support burden for very little benefit here.",
