It is entirely normal for a goroutine reading from a descriptor to hang at that point waiting for more data on the socket.\r\n\r\nFor example, please set the environment variable GOTRACEBACK=2 and show us the entire stack dump of the program when it is hanging.  It might also help to see the output of strace -f for a few minutes before the hang.",
