However, since they are\nnot discoverable via the dashboard I expect there are\nrelatively few.\n\nSo the answer to what about people who don't know\nabout /r/ will have to be 'they need to learn about it'.\n\nIf there are specific projects that are in widespread use\nand need an /r/ path, they can be special cased in gofix.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
