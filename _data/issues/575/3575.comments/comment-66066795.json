I\nthink this was determined to not be a Go bug (see \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/6336\"\u003eissue #6336\u003c/a\u003e). We might detect and work\naround it, though.\n\nAlternatively, you can update your glibc, or use the netgo build tag and use Go's\nbuilt-in DNS resolver instead of the system one.\u003c/pre\u003e",
