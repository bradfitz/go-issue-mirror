I've been following \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/6336\"\u003eissue #6336\u003c/a\u003e as well.\nTried the netgo build tag (go install -a -tags netgo std and netgo net iirc) but dns\nresolution eventually stops working after a while. Perhaps because my program uses\nsqlite thus cgo can't be disabled? Not sure if that has anything to do with it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
