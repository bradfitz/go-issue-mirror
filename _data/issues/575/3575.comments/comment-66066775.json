(Again, not suggesting this as a solution.)\n- I wrote a C program that exhibits the same behavior, so this may not be a Go problem\nafter all. Source code is attached for the curious. (Compile with gcc -lpthread\ndnserror.c.)\n\nSo now I'm left with the unfortunate possibilities of a glibc bug or some kind of\nconfiguration error. I've come across a few other people with this problem also, so if\nit's a configuration error it must be a relatively common one.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3575/11/dnserror.c\"\u003ednserror.c\u003c/a\u003e (815 bytes)",
