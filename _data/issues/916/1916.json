	"body": "by **fvbommel**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Create a Go file that's not formatted right. For example:\n===\npackage main\n\nfunc main() {\nreturn\n}\n===\n(Note the lack of indentation before 'return')\n2. Run 'gofmt -d' on it.\n3. Wonder where your diff output is.\n\nBonus bug:\n4) Create a Go file that contains something gofix would change, such as:\n=====\npackage main\n\nimport \u0026quot;http\u0026quot;\n\nfunc foo() (a, b interface{}) {\n\tresp, _, err := http.Get(url)\n\treturn resp, err\n}\n=====\n5) Run 'gofix -diff' on it.\n6) Experience a deja-vu.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nA diff between the on-disk version and the reformatted/fixed version, something like\nthis (for the gofmt example above):\n=====\ndiff gofmt-test.go gofmt/gofmt-test.go\n--- /tmp/gofmt793939221\t2011-06-04 17:13:50.000000000 +0200\n+++ /tmp/gofmt532065648\t2011-06-04 17:13:50.000000000 +0200\n@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@\n package main\n \n func main() {\n-return\n+\treturn\n }\n=====\n\nWhat do you see instead?\ncomputing diff: exit status 1\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nUbuntu 10.10\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n3418f22c39eb weekly/weekly.2011-06-02\nThe current tip (0f1980acc591 tip) has the same issue.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThe diff program returns a non-zero exit status when it finds differences, and the\nredesigned exec package returns this as a non-nil 'err', which makes gofmt and gofix\nstop with an error before showing the diff output.\n\nThe diff() function in gofmt/gofmt.go should return a nil err instead of an *os.Waitmsg\nindicating that the program exited with non-zero exit status.\ngofix/main.go includes almost identical code (for gofix -diff), which is equally broken\nand should be fixed the same way.\n\nP.S. I also noticed that 'gofix -diff' doesn't pass '-u' to diff, but 'gofmt -d' does.\u003c/pre\u003e",
