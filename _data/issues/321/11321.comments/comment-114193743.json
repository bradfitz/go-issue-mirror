	"body": "It's not impossible for this test to fail by chance. The concurrent GC should definitely have started when it checks the memstats, but whether or not it's finished depends on timing and the stats aren't updated until it finishes. My guess is we were right on the edge before and @RLH's change to add a second mark pass (90a1996) made the concurrent mark take a little too long for this test.\r\n\r\nIt's possible we should just add a sleep in test/init1.go if the GC hasn't finished yet. That would still accomplish the original intent of checking that GC can run during init, but would make the test less flaky.\r\n\r\n@alexbrainman, do you know if you can reproduce this? Or is it just on the dashboard? If you can reproduce it, I'd love to see the output with GODEBUG=gctrace=1,gcpacertrace=1 (plus a sleep right before the panic so the GC has a chance to say something).",
