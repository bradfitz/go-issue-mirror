Do we simply return as we do when the caller supplies a duration \u0026lt;= 0 or\ndo we sleep for the maximum time allowed by int64 constraints?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-soon**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to @ality._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
