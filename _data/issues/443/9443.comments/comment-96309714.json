	"body": "This was an intended change. x(SB)(CX*1) turns into offset(CX) where offset is the address of x. As part of making Go binaries work at any link address, we changed the toolchain to use PC-relative addressing for all global symbol references. The only PC-relative memory reference is PC + int32 displacement. There is no opportunity to add more registers.\r\n\r\nWe had code in the Go tree that used this too, and we changed it to load the address of x into a register and then use that instead of x(SB) in the more complex form.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, there is no option to build the toolchain without the PC-relative addressing assumption.\r\n",
