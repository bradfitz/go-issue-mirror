Precise GC significantly exacerbates the effect of corruption.  Doing\nthings like running Sprintf in a loop are unlikely to make a difference.  What we need\nto figure out is what is causing the corruption in the first place.\n\nDoes your program use cgo at all?\n\nDoes the problem happen when you set GOMAXPROCS = 1?\n\nIt may help to set Debug to 2 near the top of pkg/runtime/mgc0.c.  That will cause a lot\nof printing, but will also detect heap corruption earlier.\n\nIt is likely that we will need to have a test case that we can reproduce on our own\nmachines, however we get there.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-asap**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
