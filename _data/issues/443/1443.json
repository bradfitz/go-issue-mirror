	"body": "by **eric.d.eisner**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. run gotest on any included package or contrived simple package\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nPASS\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\ngopack grc _test/a.a _gotest_.8 \n$GOROOT/bin/gotest: line 182:  3173 Segmentation fault      $GL _testmain.$O\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nlinux\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\ncec205247d83, and hg bisect has revealed that this regression started with the\nfloat/complex removal.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nNotably, the pkg tests don't segfault when run with all.bash, but they still segfault\nwhen run with run.bash.\n\nReplacing $GOROOT with a fresh clone fixes the problem. clean.bash should also fix it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
