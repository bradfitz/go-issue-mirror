The problem has gone away and I am pleased to report that Go build completes\nsuccessfully.  It makes me wonder if I shouldn't add this builder (a NetBSD VM on a\nVMware ESXi 3.5 server) to the list of official builders.\n\nAlso, for those who may find this information useful, the problem was addressed as\nexplained in the following: \u0026lt;\u003ca href=\"http://gnats.netbsd.org/47061\u0026gt\"\u003ehttp://gnats.netbsd.org/47061\u0026gt\u003c/a\u003e;. It may be easy for\nsomeone with a source distribution to fix the problem locally.\n\nI think this issue can be closed now.\n\nLucio.\u003c/pre\u003e",
