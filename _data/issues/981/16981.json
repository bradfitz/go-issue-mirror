I was very puzzled. Eventually, I tried that binary and it complained about an unknown driver. Turns out `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` has one file with no cgo directives: `doc.go`. Which makes failures to compile the package completely silent.\r\n\r\nI don't think that should be intended behavior. A cgo-specific error is much more useful than an attempt at building anyway, which can lead to the confusing:\r\n\r\n* broken binary (missing side effects)\r\n* \"no buildable files found\"\r\n* variable/method/function not found",
