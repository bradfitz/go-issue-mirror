I'd rather just `type Result` with just the new fields common to tests, benchmarks, and coverage. Specific results for tests, benchmarks, and coverage can be provided by fields that are pointers to structs (`Test *TestResult`, etc).\r\n- I think we *must* encapsulate any test program output in JSON objects so that it may be discarded by any program parsing the JSON objects. The suggestion to use \"JSON Sequence\" format might be the solution.\r\n",
