The protocol could go to a different package though.\r\n\r\n2. I think the problem here is that your converter has more dependencies (on IDEA components) than necessary and that's why you cannot use it in TeamCity. What prevents you from getting rid of deps or from writing the converter in Go and consume the result of conversion in both IDEA and TeamCity? a la `$ go test -json | convert-to-jet-brains-format`\r\n\r\nIn the larger picture, this would be first plugin for `go` tool and perhaps this needs to be thought through.",
