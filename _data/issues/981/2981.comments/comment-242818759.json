Slightly modified quote:\r\n\r\n\u003e key begins with a lower case character (as defined by unicode.IsLower), contains no space characters (as defined by unicode.IsSpace) nor upper case characters (as defined by unicode.IsUpper), _[text removed]_. Conventionally, multiword keys are written with the words separated by hyphens, as in cpu-speed. _[text removed]_.\r\n\r\nI believe it is simpler not to support multiple values per key. If there is a key that needs multiple values, users can agree on a separator rune, while the rest of metadata consumers don't have to deal with multiple values.\r\n\r\nWith string values we lose type safety for numeric metadata values, e.g. but I think it is acceptable, given there may be non-numeric metadata.\r\n\r\n@adg apologies for the delay ([family reasons](https://twitter.com/nodirtz/status/768225774872633344)). I do care, will update the doc.",
