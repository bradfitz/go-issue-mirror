The proposal is about providing a machine-readable output format. Since this format is unable to repeat human-readable format â€“ it's regression.\r\n\r\n\u003e My inclination is that we don't need to preserve this indentation at all.\r\n\r\n@quentinmit Are you proposing to remove nesting from `go test` standard output too?",
