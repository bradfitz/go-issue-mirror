These two designs can merge without conflicts.\r\n\r\nThat's fine.\r\n\r\nMore generally, how does/should this proposal incorporate extensibility? Adding metrics is one example, which can be accomplished by adding a Metrics field later on. The other example from #14313 is [configuration metadata](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/14313-benchmark-format.md#configuration-lines). This is generally shared across many benchmarks (though, I suppose, doesn't strictly have to be), so it's not immediately obvious to me how it would fit in to the proposed structure.",
