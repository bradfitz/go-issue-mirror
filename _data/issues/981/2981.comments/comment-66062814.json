I'm wondering, though, what the interaction of\n-test.json with cmd/go/test should be.\n\n- If we print out summary info (e.g., ok  \tarchive/tar\t0.006s), then the output of 'go\ntest' is not valid json -- you'd have to pre-process it a bit.\n- Ditto for multiple packages, if we just print out the results sequentially for each\npackage.\n\nBut, the flag is called -test.json, so 'go test' doesn't directly handle it, right?\n\nSimilarly, what should happen if -test.v and -test.json are both set? I'd suggest that\n-test.json disable chattiness because the output is part of the json result anyway.\u003c/pre\u003e",
