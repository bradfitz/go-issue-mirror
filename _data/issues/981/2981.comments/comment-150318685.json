	"body": "1. What is expected to happen when a test has an *os.Exit(99)* call, or an unhandled panic (especially from runtime, e.g. \"fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!\")? Till now, it was possible to detect which test exited/panicked in -v mode, because it printed the \"header\", i.e. `=== RUN TestPanic`. \r\n2. In the proposal, it seems that the description of the `-json` flag says \"stdout is **indented** JSON objects\" (emphasis mine) \u0026mdash; seems a bug, rest of the doc seems to have \"unindented\"?\r\n3. Not sure about the printed \"\\n\"s; is the output of a *foo.test* binary monitored, and \"\\n\"s are added only if needed? otherwise, the example output should have empty lines between the JSON objects, no?\r\n",
