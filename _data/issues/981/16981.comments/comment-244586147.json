Sorry, it sounds like skipping them has introduced.\r\n`go build -compiler=gc` prohibiting builds with C files (when CGO_ENABLED=0) happened at https://codereview.appspot.com/149720043 (go1.4).\r\n\r\nIt is more of a requirement now to ship a package with cgo and !cgo implementations because C compilers are not primarily required for Go. Implicitly scoping C files without a build tag to cgo builds is not bad but handy.\r\n\r\nsqlite package should maybe add cgo build tag to restrict itself to cgo builds.",
