	"body": "Thank you for explaining @mikioh. But I still don't see how it is helpful to user of GetAdapterAddresses that Ethernet interface has \"169.254.130.171/16\" address. It is marked as \"DHCP enabled\", so even when we bring this interface up there is no guarantee that address will remain. I think this knowledge is pretty useless and confusing. Don't you think?\r\n\r\nCan you also, please, review https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/18711/ ? Thank you.\r\n\r\nAlex",
