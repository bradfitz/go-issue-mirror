This may not be desirable for example in applications that need to handle input events ASAP (gesture recognition/reading sensors) or that struggle to maintain 60fps: suppose that physics+drawing takes just over 1/60s (say 0.02s), plus Publish() force waiting on the next vsync, the app would be stuck at 30fps. If Publish() was asynchronous, it could start updating its world and redraw immediately after calling it and achieve a near average of 1/50fps (as well as having more spare time to handle more events).\r\n\r\nEDIT: I suppose here that making Publish asynchronous mandates a dedicated publish.Event",
