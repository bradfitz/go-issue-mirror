Since the\nwebsocket code doesn't quote the strings for the key, the 2 trailing spaces are\nstripped. This results in the websocket server handler rejecting the GET request and not\nreturning information. Since the client doesn't read back any information when it\nexpects to, this causes the unexpected EOF, triggering your panic.\n\nThe attached patch to client.go addresses this issue.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/955/1/patch\"\u003epatch\u003c/a\u003e (586 bytes)",
