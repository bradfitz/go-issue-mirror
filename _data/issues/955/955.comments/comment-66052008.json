I applied the patch and working\nfine.\nI have a further questions.\n\n1. How did you find out the 2 space characters? Are there any go related debugging\ntools, or you just read the code and found out? I just started learning golang, so any\ndebugging tips are appreciated.\n\n2. How many connections can you make? \n\nWhen I tried websocket2.go (see the attached), it starts failing once it reaches over\n1000 connections (but the failure timing is not consistent. Sometimes goes more than\n15000, and some times fails around 1000). I do expect that I can make at least 20,000\nconnections easily, as I was able to using ruby websocket server (note: ulimit is set to\n100000). I know I should not really make this many connections, but I am kind of trying\nto push the boundary, since this is regression test script.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://gist.github.com/491379\"\u003ehttp://gist.github.com/491379\u003c/a\u003e\n\n3. Does the script work on all environment? I can make certain number of connections\nwhen I try with OSX. When I try with Linux Ubuntu (Linux vm02.staging.pusherapp.com\n2.6.32-305-ec2 #9-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 15 04:14:01 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux), I get\n\"connection refuesed\" error message and can not connect any. \n\n\u003ca href=\"http://gist.github.com/491387\"\u003ehttp://gist.github.com/491387\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/955/4/websocket2.go\"\u003ewebsocket2.go\u003c/a\u003e (561 bytes)",
