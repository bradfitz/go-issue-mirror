There are a handful of places where this function is used in the\nNetBSD kernel - one of which is the rndopen() function (in sys/dev/rndpseudo.c), which\nis used when the /dev/urandom device is opened.\n\nI (or someone else) still needs to dig further, however this cloned descriptor either\ndoes not have FD_CLOEXEC set and/or we are not setting it, which results in the file\ndescriptor leak when Go does a fork/exec.\u003c/pre\u003e",
