So, it tries to grow stack and it needs m for that, but m is 0 in\nTestCthread.\n\nI can mark runtime.usleep to be \"testflag 7\", but that is not enough, because\nruntime.usleep calls OS and therefore switches stacks. Should runtime.usleep be both\n\"testflag 7\" and not switch stacks?\n\nI tried to do that, and tests PASS. But I am not certain. Also runtime.usleep needs to\nbe rewritten in asm, because otherwise the stack of \"textflag 7\" functions becomes too\nlong. I have done it for amd64, I will do it for 386 as well, if my assumptions are\nvalid.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-windows**._",
