	"body": "In net/http, before cookies are read, they are [checked to ensure they have a valid name](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/3c4be235be8dcd124fe8d536af3e422729a85785/src/net/http/cookie.go#L361). However, when setting a cookie, an invalid name may be used; rather than being permitted, this should trigger an error.\r\n\r\nThere is further discussion on the [gorilla sessions topic](https://github.com/gorilla/sessions/issues/36) in which it was suggested that I raise this possibility here.\r\n\r\nTo answer the questions in the guidelines:\r\nWhat version of Go are you using (go version)? 1.4\r\nWhat operating system and processor architecture are you using? OS X 64-bit\r\nWhat did you do? Created a cookie with an empty name (or spaces, or other invalid characters) and set it in a way that was seemingly successful.\r\nWhat did you expect to see? I expected to see an error.\r\nWhat did you see instead? I saw my cookie get set, but I could not read it (as its name is invalid, and correctly filtered out on the reading end of things).",
