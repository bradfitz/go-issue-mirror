Bad API design maybe, but it's the way it is. \n\nWe can't change from runtime.Goexit to a panic in general; the whole point of using Goexit was that it does not look like a panic and cannot be stopped.\n\nI don't see any way to change the current behavior nor do I see any way to make the current behavior louder.",
