The problem is not that there is not\nenough virtual address space available to the process, but that it has been fragmented\nby the system (and other dll's which like to insert themselves into processes) dlls. The\nGo garbage collector currently requires a contiguous heap, and it is these dlls which\nlimit the maximum size of the heap by fragmenting it.\n\npassing /LARGEADDRESSAWARE may help, but it feels like a loosing battle.\u003c/pre\u003e",
