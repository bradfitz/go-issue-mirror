If you rebase your dlls to somewhere closer\nto the executable image, you can clear a hole in the address space that (in my case) is\nlarge enough to allow the memory allocation to succeed.\n\nYou can use Visual Studio's editbin.exe tool to rebase your dlls.  However, I can't seem\nto rebase dlls that have been digitally signed, d3dx9_43.dll is one example.  But if\nyou're only using unsigned dlls then this might be an acceptable workaround.\n\n-Eric\u003c/pre\u003e",
