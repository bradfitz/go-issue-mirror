	"body": "CL 20981 added bounds checking hints to encoding/binary, of the form\r\n\r\n`b = b[:8:len(b)]`\r\n\r\nIt would be clearer and simpler and generate less code to use:\r\n\r\n`_ = b[7]`\r\n\r\nHowever, the compiler isn't yet able to use such a hint.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to teach the compiler to use such a hint and to update whatever sites it has already been used. At a minimum, this is encoding/binary, but #14884 suggests using it in the `image` package, and I wouldn't be surprised to find it popping up other places soon as well.\r\n\r\nFor more background, see the discussion at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/jVP6h21OyL8\r\n\r\nMarking tentatively as Go 1.7, because once this gets released, lots of folks will start adding bounds checking hints of one kind or another, and it'd be nice if they were of the shorter form.\r\n",
