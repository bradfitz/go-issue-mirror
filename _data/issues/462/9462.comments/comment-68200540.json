Because all the needed method for interface\nreflect.Type are defined\non a pointer receiver, so reflect.rtype won't actually meet the requirement\nof reflect.Type. thus\nreturning reflect.rtype as reflect.Type doesn't make any sense at all.\n\nThe way go/ssa/interp works is that it provides a fake implementation of\nreflect.Type (unhelpfully\ncalled reflect.rtype, but all the methods are implemented on reflect.rtype,\nnot *reflect.rtype), however,\nthis breaks down with the Go tip reorganizations as now reflect actually\ndefines rtype and it no\nlonger is an opaque type as expected by go/ssa/interp.\n\nI think go/ssa/interp will have to rewrite the reflect emulation code to\nadapt to this, and it will have\nto actually implement the same rtype interface implemented by cmd/gc.",
