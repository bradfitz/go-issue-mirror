If a client did sprintf(\"%s\n%s\", email, email) instead of sprintf(\"\\\"%s\\\" %s\", email, email), which some clients do\naccording to my research.\n\nI'm okay with you closing this bug and me being the oddball case.  The only reason I\nnoticed this is because python's built in email package was parsing them.  For\nposterity's sake, I wrote a small python and go program to extract To and CC fields from\na glob of files.  I put them up here:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/wathiede/GoMailBug\"\u003ehttps://github.com/wathiede/GoMailBug\u003c/a\u003e \n\nIt is interesting to throw those at a big directory of mail files and try to understand\nthe differences.  Currently, other than the little problem with my sent folder, the only\nissue I spotted was related to headers with unusual whitespacing; as that's already\nlisted as a TODO, it is to be expected.\u003c/pre\u003e",
