I never quite needed to reset the system, though.\n\nStats suggested that the system was load-saturated, but I never dug any deeper, leaving\nthat for when the utility is complete.\n\nIf this is not a familiar situation for anyone else (I'm running a fairly stock Bell\nLabs distribution), then I'll report it separately when I start investigating it\nproperly.\n\nLucio.\u003c/pre\u003e",
