Stats shows full \"load\"\nutilisation and I'm fairly certain that the Go application has been crashed when I\ndeleted the rio window it was hanging in.\n\nThe natural response to such a hang has been to type \"ps\" in another window and I am\nconvinced that doing so either jams the machine (not tightly: I can open new windows and\nmess with the rio menu; some things get very slow) or causes the hanging Go application\nto finish.\n\nI know my guesses are usually uninspired, but /proc seems very much involved in the\nproblem and load saturation seems also relevant.  It is however hard to debug because\none can't easily access the guilty process.  I'm hoping that someone else may recognise\nthe symptoms as familiar and recommend some unconventional debugging technique (I'm not\nmuch good with the conventional ones, I tend to use printf() a lot).\n\nLucio.\u003c/pre\u003e",
