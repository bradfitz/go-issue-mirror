However, remove-text-properties is \npresent in both Emacs and XEmacs, so we could simply replace the use of remove-list-\nof-text-properties with remove-text-properties and put nil's after both properties in \nthe list passed to the function.\n\nI have some other pending changes to go-mode, but if this hasn't been fixed when those \ngo in, I'll make a CL.\u003c/pre\u003e",
