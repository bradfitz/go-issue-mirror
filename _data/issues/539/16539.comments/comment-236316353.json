	"body": "@minux that was actually my first idea but I thought using the type name by default was simpler, I'm not opposed to going back to that idea though if thats the consensus.\r\n\r\n@jimmyfrasche if we implemented @minux's idea of trimming the longest common prefix when you pass just a `-trimprefix` flag, would that resolve the issue of having to pass a signifying value like `-`? Or does that still change the behaviour? (I've yet to look at the stringer code). To your other question, yes I would expect if you passed a prefix to trim (`Type`) and a constant didn't start with that prefix (`UnknownType`), you just get the unchanged constant back (`UnknownType`), as per your example.",
