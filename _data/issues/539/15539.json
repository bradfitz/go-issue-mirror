	"body": "Seen in TestFP/TestFp on the builder: https://build.golang.org/log/d9a463f06b55a67d70805a7bcb1cd18eed65d3ec\r\n\r\n`uint64` to `float64` casts should round to nearest with ties to even. However on ppc64 large `uint64` values are shifted right by 1 so that they can be reinterpreted as `int64` values (so that they can be fed into the `fcfid` instruction). Unfortunately this truncates the original value, possibly (as in this test I think) resulting in a tie where there was none before.\r\n\r\nCan ppc64 use the `fcfidu` instruction instead?",
