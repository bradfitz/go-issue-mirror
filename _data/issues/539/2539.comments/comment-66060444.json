Also, and not to derail\nthe original issue, the real problem (for me anyway) isn't in the high memory usage but\nin the fact that it doesn't get garbage collected.  Spiking to 1GB of ram just to decode\nmy 100MB file is annoying (and could be entirely necessary) but mostly harmless.  The\nfact that the memory isn't reclaimed is the more troublesome part.\n\nSome informal testing with my own data:\n\nDecode my 120MB file and trash the result (so as not to have it count against memory\nusage) jumped me to ~600MB from a baseline of 14 or so.  Decoding again jumped up to\nabout 1GB of RAM... and it stayed there.  I could decode that or other files multiple\ntimes after that and usage didn't increase again.  Tested with runtime.GC() and without\nit, no difference.\n\nData was ~900,000 float64/float32 pairs and an equal number of uint32s. No strings.\u003c/pre\u003e",
