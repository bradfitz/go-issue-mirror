Here is one:\n\npackage main\n\nfunc main() {\n    var a [4]byte\n    var b [4]byte\n    copy(a,b) // fails\n    copy(\u0026a,\u0026b) // works\n}\n\nIt may be obvious to a go expert that an array is not a slice or an array pointer, but\nit \nis not necessarily obvious to an inexperienced go developer. The language does so \nmuch to hide the difference between pointer and reference and array that the \ninexperienced developer may not realize what to do to solve the problem.\n\nThat's why a hint from the compiler as to which arguments are causing the problem \nand what the incorrect type is would help the developer correct their code.\u003c/pre\u003e",
