	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eA single POST request to some servers (notably some versions of IIS and/or some versions\nof ASP.NET) will generate an HTTP 100 CONTINUE whether or not the Expect: header for it\nwas sent, prior to the 200 which the client actually wants.\n\nExample:\n$ curl -i -H \u0026quot;Content-Type:application/json\u0026quot; -X POST -d$REDACTED \u003ca href=\"http://foo/bar\"\u003ehttp://foo/bar\u003c/a\u003e\nHTTP/1.1 100 CONTINUE\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/5.1\nDate: Tue, 23 Aug 2011 16:22:13 GMT\nX-Powered-By: ASP.NET\n \nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/5.1\nDate: Tue, 23 Aug 2011 16:22:13 GMT\nX-Powered-By: ASP.NET\nX-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727\nCache-Control: private\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 470\n\n{\u0026quot;redacted\u0026quot;:true}\n\nCurrently, this will cause the persistent HTTP connection to either (a) return the\nsecond request to the next request made on that connection or (b) print an unsolicited\nresponse warning.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- Subsequent requests should not be broken by this.\n\nOptional:\n- The 200 and its associated information could be returned and the 100 ignored.\n- The 100 could be returned, and the connection terminated (preventing other requests\nfrom reusing the connection and returning bad data)\u003c/pre\u003e",
