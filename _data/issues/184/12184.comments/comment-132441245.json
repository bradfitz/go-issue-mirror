I confirmed that this was broken in Go 1.4 as well, so it must not be common enough a case to merit a last-minute fix for Go 1.5. I think the fix is easy: return CertificateInvalidError{c, Expired} for len(leaf.Raw) == 0. But maybe that will just uncover the next problem with the Windows code on an empty certificate.\r\n",
