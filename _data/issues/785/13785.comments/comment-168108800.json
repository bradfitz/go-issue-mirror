	"body": "Changing internal/syscall/unix to utilize getentropy() on OpenBSD sounds reasonable to me.\r\n\r\nIt won't be added to package syscall though (which is frozen), and I don't see a need to add it to golang.org/x/sys/unix either, since Linux's getrandom() isn't available there either.\r\n\r\nThere's no need to add syscall.Syscall2.  You can use syscall.Syscall and just pass 0 as a dummy third argument.\r\n\r\nDon't send a Github pull request.  Upload a CL to Gerrit, like the Contribution Guidelines explain.  (But expect to wait until after 1.6 is released for it to be reviewed.)",
