I can try to get more information on why this is the case, although I've mentioned a few probable reasons above.\r\n\r\nI think there's a chance of a slight misunderstanding, though, based on your wording:\r\n\r\n\u003e If you want to propose that crypto/rand feed the kernel entropy source through another userspace CSPRNG, I suggest you do that as a separate issue.\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by \"another\" here? If you're referring to getentropy as a userland CSPRNG, remember: it's a system call directly to the kernel.",
