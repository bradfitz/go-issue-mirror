I noticed that there's logic in the kernel's `randomread()` (the randomness pseudo-devices' backend) which creates a separate ChaCha20 instance for \u003e2048-byte requests. I therefore figured that this logic was considered more robust for large or repeated entropy pulls. How does that factor in? \r\n\r\nMost importantly, it seems that there can't be an information leak from doing too many getentropy reads because it's functionally no different from a series of `/dev/urandom` reads.",
