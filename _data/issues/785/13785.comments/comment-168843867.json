It's not otherwise relevant to correctness/security here.\r\n\r\nSo I'd propose you start by just seeing if replacing /dev/urandom reads with getentropy on OpenBSD.  Unless there are lots of Read calls that ask for \u003e256 bytes at a time, that should be a pure net win.\r\n\r\nSeparately, you can propose using a userspace CSPRNG that we seed from the kernel, but I'm not convinced at this time that that's necessary.  (I also agree with DJB that [\"We _want_ the OS to \r\nbe centralizing not just the entropy gathering but also the PRNG.\"](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/randomness-generation/4opmDHA6_3w/dIVn3yF8vG8J).)\r\n\r\nCheers",
