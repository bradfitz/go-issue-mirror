Basically I'm relatively new to go, and am trying to evaluate wether I can use it to build a decently fast reverse proxy. Running wrk against a go http server that simply returns a hello world string, I get the following (very unscientific) results:\r\n\r\nWith no proxy\r\nwrk -t2 -c100 -d15s http://127.0.0.1:3000\r\n29k requests/second, 0% failure\r\n\r\nWith nginx in front\r\nwrk -t2 -c100 -d15s http://127.0.0.1:4205\r\n28k requests/second, 0% failure\r\n\r\nWith NewSingleHostReverseProxy in front (https://play.golang.org/p/vk33Eg4QOS)\r\nwrk -t2 -c100 -d15s http://127.0.0.1:4204\r\n800 requests/second, 20% failure\r\n\r\nIs this typical, or am I doing something wrong in the go code / testing setup. I'm running this on a Macbook Pro, max file descriptors have been increased.",
