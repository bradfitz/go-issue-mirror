	"body": "It's the progenitor of Linux's `getrandom(2)`, which Go already supports. I have a patch that works on AMD64. I won't submit a pull request until it's tested on i386 and ARM (help welcome!).\r\n\r\nThis generally just involves mirroring the approach used for `getrandom(2)`. However, we don't need to test for availability, as all supported OpenBSD releases have `getentropy(2)`. The only other caveat is that I had to add `syscall.Syscall2()` for OpenBSD, as `getentropy(2)` takes two arguments.\r\n\r\nThe interface is very simple - here's the [man page](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man2/getentropy.2).\r\n\r\nIt's a pretty straightforward change. I just wanted to mention it as early as possible, as per the [Contribution Guidelines](https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html).\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
