It's\ndefining an implementation instead of a high-level goal. \n\nFor example, the high-level goal of sync.Pool is to reclaim memory kept in caches. It\nhappens that we built a very fast sync.Pool by using per-CPU storage underneath, but the\nper-CPU storage is not the point.\n\nI suspect that the real thing you need is a better high-level target than per-CPU\nstorage.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
