I want more complex objects than a simple integer counter, with custom aggregation\nlogic. \n\nI assume acquire fetches an instance of T from the cpu local(?); release returns the\ninstance to the current cpu local. Since a goroutine can be moved to another cpu,\nrelease may return the instance to a different cpu local. If my guess is correct, there\ncould be multiple T instances corresponding to a single cpu at a certain point.\nDo you expect foreach can work as flush mechanism of Ts as well?\u003c/pre\u003e",
