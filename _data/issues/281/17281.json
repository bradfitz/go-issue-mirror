	"body": "go/internal/gcimporter.FindExportData returns some errors directly from the underlying bufio.Reader, and these may be confusing to the caller.  For example, we recently switched from using combined .a files to split .x/.a files for export data and object code.  Tools that tried to load export data from a new .a file would seek beyond the end of the file in `r.ReadSlice('\\n')`, which returned \"buffer full\".\r\n\r\nFindExportData needs to prepend additional context such as \"can't find export data: %v\".",
