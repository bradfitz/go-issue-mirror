This is a feature request.\n\nPotential use case:\n\nscalable stats across many goroutines - stat updates are batched in the per-CPU stat\nobject. Periodically or on-demand, the stat batches are aggregated to a global stat\nobject. \n\nThis is similar to sync.Pool in that it will help reducing lock contention, but\ndifferent in that the object lifetime should be explicit and the per-CPU objects need to\nbe accessible from other CPUs if necessary.\u003c/pre\u003e",
