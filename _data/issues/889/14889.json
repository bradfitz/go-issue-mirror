What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\ngo version go1.6 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n(rest doesn't apply, since I don't report  a bug here)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to make it easier to define, shareable, read-only views of data from which many consumable readers can be derived.\r\n\r\nI did expect something like https://godoc.org/github.com/nightlyone/views/bytes \r\nand https://godoc.org/github.com/nightlyone/views/strings in the respective bytes and strings packages of the stdlib.\r\n\r\nThese are useful in interfaces like https://godoc.org/github.com/nightlyone/views",
