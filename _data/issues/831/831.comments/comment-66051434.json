Applications\nthat go out of their way to replace standard error with\na data file are really shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nFurther, this detail doesn't belong in the language spec,\nbecause it's a detail of the implementation (Unix) not the\nlanguage.  In an environment that doesn't have a concept\nof \"standard error\" such as a graphical or web-based\nenvironment, the errors might go somewhere else.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
