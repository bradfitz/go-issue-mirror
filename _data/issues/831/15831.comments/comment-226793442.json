	"body": "Thanks, that revision does have a write barrier on line 381 (for my future reference: [this line](https://github.com/google/gopacket/blob/1b0b789/layers/enums.go#L381)), which happens when writing the value part from the interface returned by `convT2E` for the `i` argument to `fmt.Sprintf` into the argument slice for `fmt.Sprintf`. (Which is a little weird since the slice is on the stack, but I guess we lost track of that.) Hence the bad 0x68686868 pointer presumably came from `convT2E`. How that happened, I'm not sure. The `convT2E` call is, roughly, `convT2E(type.int, i, nil)`, so the value should have been allocated via `newobject`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by there being no \"magic init\" in android-lib?",
