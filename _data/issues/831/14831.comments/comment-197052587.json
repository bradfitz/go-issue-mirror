	"body": "I should note that I'm doing some IOCTL calls during the lifetime of the program. I think I narrowed it down to one IOCTL call that seems to be causing it, but not all the time. I tried forcing a runtime.GC() call right after the IOCTL call and it reproduces faster. I will have to review that code some more and make sure the kernel is not writing past the buffer I'm passing to it (buffer is allocated in Go, just a []byte) and corrupting something in the process.",
