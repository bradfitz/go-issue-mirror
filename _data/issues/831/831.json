Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Read the language specification\n2. Note that the panic documentation doesn't refer to standard error\n3. Have an application programmer use file descriptor 2 for a data file and\nthen have the application panic to cause data corruption\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\nThe language specification and probably \u0026quot;Effective Go\u0026quot; need to stress the\nneed to preserve standard error as somewhere that error messages may be\nsafely written by the Go runtime and packages.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n\nN/A, but darwin and amd64.\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\nDocuments from golang.org dated\n\n# Last update\n# Sun May 30 23:16:07 PDT 2010\n# Build version 5383\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
