	"body": "by **elazarl**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhen compiling go env.bash makes sure /usr/bin and /bin will always be before the\noriginal path.\n\nHow should you compile go if you happen to have gcc in /opt/gcc-4.6.0/bin? Setting\nCC=/opt/gcc-4.6.0/bin/gcc won't help since cgo won't use it. What if you want to use the\nbison program in ~/bison/bin, since the bison installation on the machine is dated?\n\nAttached a patch that prepends the alternate paths of $CC as (which will mark the path\nof the entire binutils) and bison, before /bin and /usr/bin if needed.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1946/0/env.bash.patch\"\u003eenv.bash.patch\u003c/a\u003e (580 bytes)",
