For other programs I don't understand the need to have the timer frequency high. I would imagine that tasks would typically be happening as quickly as possible (reading files, doing calculations, passing messages) and I'm curious as to what sort of timeouts, or waits, or sleeps are being affected by the timer frequency.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if some Go programs need the timer frequency then those Go programs should raise the timer frequency. I have no problem with that. But if the Go runtime raises the timer frequency then that is a problem. We could debate whether raising the timer frequency should be opt-in (my strong vote) or opt-out, but it should be a choice. Otherwise long-running low-activity Go programs will be blacklisted by anybody who wants good battery life.\r\n\r\nGo deserves better than that.",
