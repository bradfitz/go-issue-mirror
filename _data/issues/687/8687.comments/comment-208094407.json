So https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/20834/ restored original behavior - Go runtime is calling timeBeginPeriod again. Therefore I am reopening this issue.\r\n\r\nCurrent plan is to resolve #7876 to get rid of calling timeBeginPeriod again. But nobody is working on #7876 at this moment.\r\n\r\nAlex",
