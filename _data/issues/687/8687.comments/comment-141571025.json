It sounds like we should revisit this once I figure out how to eliminate that wait loop. :) I think it would still be worth checking the nsleep counter to lend hard evidence to this hypothesis (@alexbrainman, would that be convenient for you to do?)\r\n\r\n\u003e Unfortunately I am not aware of a way to sleep for 100us on Windows.\r\n\r\nIt looks like we use NtWaitForSingleObject. Remarkably, as far as I can tell, the Windows documentation doesn't specify the *units* for the timeout argument, but the runtime code claims it takes multiples of 100ns.",
