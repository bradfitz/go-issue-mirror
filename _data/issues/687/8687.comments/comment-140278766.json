(see bench.txt in https://gist.github.com/alexbrainman/914885b57518cb4a6e39 ). Unfortunately I can see quite significant slowdowns here and there. The change looks like a no go for me. Maybe gophers who know more about Go scheduler can explain the slowdowns and suggest ways to improve the situation.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, if someone cares about this, they can comment out call to timeBeginPeriod.\r\n\r\nAlex",
