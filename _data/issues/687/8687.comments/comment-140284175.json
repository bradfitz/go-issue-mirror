But I don't know enough about Go runtime to give you explanation. And I am hopeful that other gophers will comment. All I can say is that Windows makes the task much harder when everything is measured in 15 milliseconds (comparing to nanoseconds on linux) - imagine running scheduler that performs equally well on both. But maybe Go runtime can be improved on windows, and we can disable timeBeginPeriod call.\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n",
