I used \"powercfg /energy /duration 5\" to identify the culprit, a go program that was running in the background. This go program was monitoring system status and was idle about 99.9% of the time but because of the go runtime's decision to raise the timer frequency for *all* go programs this background program was measurably affecting power consumption and battery life. This 99.9% idle go program was affecting my computer more than a program that was actively running.\r\n\r\nThis was clearly a case where the program did not need a higher timer frequency. Raising the timer frequency is a reasonable *option* for the go runtime, but it is absolutely not a reasonable *default* for the go runtime.\r\n\r\nChrome has been fixed to not leave the timer frequency high, so has SDL, and so have many other products. Go needs to do likewise. Please.",
