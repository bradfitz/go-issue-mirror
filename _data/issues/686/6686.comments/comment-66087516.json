I've mailed you CL \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/17820044\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/17820044\u003c/a\u003e to\nfix this particular test, but I have no way to test it, plesdr so let me know if it\nworks for you.\n\nThe CL should fix this particular instance but in general the there may be differences\nbetween the points-to relations on different platforms because they execute different\ncode.  Such differences are hopefully minor but they do need to be addressed; it's on my\nTODO list.\u003c/pre\u003e",
