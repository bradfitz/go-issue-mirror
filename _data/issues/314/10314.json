	"body": "I have encountered an issue where ./all.bash returns a status indicating the build has failed to pass runtime/map_test.go because the test spends more than 2 mins executing code within testsCurrentReadsAfterGrowth() func on my Intel Atom n455e CPU. (1.67 GHz 64-bit single core cpu w/ 2 hyperthreads, no AES, 1GB DDR3, very lightweight Arch operating system with the latest kernel from the official Arch repo.). \r\n\r\nI am currently testing to see if changing the default timeout from 2 mins to 5 mins will give my CPU enough time to finish the heavy computation. \r\n\r\n",
