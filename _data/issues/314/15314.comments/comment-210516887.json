	"body": "Could we add a mechanism to the json package that allows a struct to declare that it should have strict or non-strict handling, independent of how the decoder is configured? This could be an interface, or a pair of zero-size types (or a bool type) that could be embedded -- in much the same way that the xml package provides configurability -- or perhaps a json struct tag that could be recognized on any padding field.\r\n\r\nThere are cases where it's desirable for some json objects in a \"document\" to be treated strictly, whereas others in the same document should be non-strict (yet still warrant use of a struct instead of a map). Allowing an \"overflow\" map field would make it easier to express this (if you include such a map field, and turn on strict handling, the containing struct would be non-strict).",
