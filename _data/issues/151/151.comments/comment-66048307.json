But that's not a reason NOT to also add a more \nexplicit syntax.\n\nAdd a compiler flag to warn about the risky/legacy numeric literals (including stuff \nlike \"0O\", if possible in the new syntax), and add a flag to gofmt to permit auto-\nconversion to the most explicit syntax.\n\nThen wait a year, grep the Go application base, and check the ratio of legacy octals \nto \"new\" octals.  If \"new\" octals dominate heavily, only then would it be useful to \nconsider deleting the legacy octal syntax from Go.\u003c/pre\u003e",
