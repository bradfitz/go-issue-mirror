We've taken a very conservative\ndefinition here (mention) because it is easy to understand,\nif occasionally over-restrictive.  Writing a spec that was\nboth complete and still correct would have been many\nmore words, more than we wanted in the spec.  We can\nalways expand it later but for now that's what it is.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
