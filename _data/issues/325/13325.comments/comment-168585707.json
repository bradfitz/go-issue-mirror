I double checked that closing the request's `Cancel` channel after `Do` return does behave like you'd expect, so I'm just trying to work out the best way to plumb that into the `ctxhttp` package.\r\n\r\nFWIW, there is a slight bug in the test above: since the headers are never being flushed the call to `Do` is never even returning. You can fix that by writing sufficient data to the body, or by calling `Flush`:\r\n\r\n     w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)\r\n     w.(http.Flusher).Flush()\r\n",
