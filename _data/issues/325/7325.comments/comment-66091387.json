Define handler once per program:\nwill work for all threads and callbacks. Hopefully we don't have to worry about\nAddVectoredExceptionHandler stack, like we do here.\n\nMaybe we can even leave most of current SEH code alone. It can get called for win2k. It\nis broken, but it was broken before.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
