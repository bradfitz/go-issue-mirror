	"body": "Using go 1.7.1/Windows 7/amd64. `x/mobile` at 16fd47fa04e0a40c643b41876f91f3d06dded396 + fix from #16991.\r\n\r\nThis is issue can easily be seen when resizing the window: [basic](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4300994/Go/WindowsBufferQueueingBasic.gif) and [centering](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4300994/Go/WindowsBufferQueueing.gif).\r\n\r\n`theApp` event queue contains an infinite buffer in `x\\mobile\\app\\app.go` and when Windows sends messages at a high rate -- e.g. during a window resize -- the whole interface becomes laggy.\r\n\r\nWindows sends events [as fast as you let it](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20111219-00/?p=8863) -- but since there is no back-pressure in `x\\mobile\\app\\shiny.go` the queue gets flooded with Paint and Resize events.\r\n\r\n_PS: It could become an issue in shiny as well, because it also contains async handling of messages. However ATM there is no infinite queue, at least I couldn't find one, hence it provides some back-pressure which prevents Windows from flooding the queue._",
