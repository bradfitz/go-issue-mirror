For the\ntime being I've stoppped using StdoutPipe, but I'd like to fix it properly.\n\nI'm wondering if it might be a good idea to remove closeAfterWait entirely. If we're not\ngoing to close the client side of the pipe, then ISTM that all the other current use\ncases can be catered for by doing the close inside the started goroutine.\u003c/pre\u003e",
