	"body": "Interesting... we have no test coverage for CloseClientConnections at all. And because CloseClientConnections just uses an internal closeConn function, and closeConn was made async for an earlier change, it ended up making CloseClientConnections async, which we then never noticed for lack of tests.\r\n\r\nI filed #14291 to investigate making closeConn not async for Go 1.7, but for Go 1.6 we can probably just fix CloseClientConnections to wait on the conns being closed before returning, which would prevent your handler from then replying with 200 OK.  (I can reproduce)\r\n\r\nI'll add this as a test, too.\r\n",
