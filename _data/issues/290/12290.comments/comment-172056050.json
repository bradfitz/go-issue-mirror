The\nPr(rand.Float64() \u003c 1) in that system was not 1.0: it could return 1\nsometimes, and the red line does not get to the top of the rightmost graph.\n\nThe second row is the \"corrected\" behavior, which returns 0 too often. The\nPr(rand.Float64() \u003c 1) in that system is 1.0, but overall Pr(rand.Float64()\n\u003c x) was much larger than x for small values of x. You can see this most\nclearly in the second graph on the row, where the red line is nowhere near\nthe blue line. In general quantization means it can't be a perfect match,\nbut you'd want to see it dipping down to the blue line on occasion, or even\ncrossing.\n\nThe third row is the new resampling behavior, which I argue does not return\n0 nor values close to 0 too often. Again there is quantization, but the red\ny=Pr(rand.Float64() \u003c x) tracks the blue line y=x quite nicely. To me, the\ngraphs show that the systematic bias of the first row and the different\nsystematic bias of the second row are both gone.\n\nRuss\n",
