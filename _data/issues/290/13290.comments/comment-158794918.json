Even though [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/acl/) for example allows ACL also on Referer and MIME headers (in addition to User-Agent).\r\n\r\nMostly solving by whitelisting means we decide which of the headers it is OK to share with the proxy, but we lose the ability to share certain headers only with the proxy and not with destination host.\r\n\r\nI don't know if that is something other people might find useful (but [some](https://github.com/request/request#proxies) do).",
