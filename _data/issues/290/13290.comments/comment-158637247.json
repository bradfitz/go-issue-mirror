	"body": "The question of what headers to send to proxy is indeed an interesting one, and a good place to see this issue develop is in the CURL library, which (after some [iterations](http://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2014/04/04/curl-and-proxy-headers/), and a [vulnerability](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150429.html)) figured out what I think is the correct approach.\r\n\r\nYou simply have to specify **explicitly** the headers that you want sent to proxy.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to achieve this, the most trivial being:\r\n\r\n    req, err := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", rdurl.String(), nil)\r\n    req.Header.Set(\"User-Agent\", \"Wget/1.9.1\")\r\n    req.ProxyHeader.Set(\"User-Agent\", \"Wget/1.9.1\")\r\n\r\nGoing in a direction @minux suggests - defining a fixed (and hidden) list of headers which are also sent to proxy feels like a move in the wrong direction because the behavior is hard to debug for user, and the list of headers and their impact (over time) can be dangerous -- what others headers will we add, how will their function change over time, etc.\r\n\r\nI understand that introducing a new field to Request struct is not something to be taken lightly, and I'll be happy to hear other thoughts, as well as help with the implementation and testing of this feature.\r\n",
