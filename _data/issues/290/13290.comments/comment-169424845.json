And we can't simply pass the original *http.Request to the dialConn code because of socket late binding.\r\n\r\nI think we'll probably have to address this with new API surface, but that would have to wait until Go 1.7.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround in the meantime, perhaps you can just set the `Transport.DialTLS` hook and do the proxy connection and CONNECT request / response yourself (in your DialTLS hook). Looks like that should work.",
