	"body": "Lack of the leading `/` was a typo, but you're right, it does work properly with it; not sure why I couldn't get it to work yesterday; perhaps I had a similar bug then. This works:\r\n\r\n    username := \"foo/bar\"\r\n    url := url.URL{\r\n        Scheme:  \"https\",\r\n        Host:    \"example.com\",\r\n        Path:    \"/user/\" + username,\r\n        RawPath: \"/user/\" + url.QueryEscape(username),\r\n    }\r\n    println(url.String())\r\n\r\nStill, I wasn't asking a question (though I'm glad to have this improved workaround), but requesting a feature: The ability to specify the path as a slice of segments. This allows me to avoid knowing what to escape (`RawPath`) and what not to (`Path`), which always feels weird, like more cognitive overhead than really ought to be necessary.",
