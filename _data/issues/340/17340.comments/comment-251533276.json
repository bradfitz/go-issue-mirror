	"body": "You are on the right track with `RawPath`, but your `Path` and `RawPath` do not match:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    Path:    \"/user/\" + username,\r\n    RawPath: \"user/\" + strings.Replace(username, \"/\", \"%2F\", -1),\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis yields a `Path` of `\"/user/foo/bar\"` and a `RawPath` of `\"user/foo%2Fbar\"`. The documentation for URL says:\r\n\r\n\u003e The Parse function sets both Path and RawPath in the URL it returns, and URL's String method uses RawPath if it is a valid encoding of Path, by calling the EscapedPath method.\r\n\r\nIn this case, your `RawPath` is missing the leading slash, and therefore it is not a valid encoding of `Path`. This should just work correctly if you add the missing slash.\r\n\r\nThat said, you should probably also be using `url.QueryEscape`, instead of your `strings.Replace`, because there might be other characters to escape as well.\r\n\r\nWe do not use our issue tracker for questions; please see the resources at https://golang.org/wiki/Questions for help debugging code.",
