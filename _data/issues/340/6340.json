	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe deadline support introduced in the net package is currently restricted to dialing\n(network, address string) via net.DialTimeout or Dialer, or to already established\nconnections. It would be valuable to have more functionality covered.\n\nThe specific use case at hand when this was missed was with ResolveTCPAddr and DialTCP.\nIt's not possible to timeout the resolution, and once an address is obtained, the only\nway to dial with a timeout is by stringifying the address again and submitting into\nDialTimeout or Dialer for re-parsing.\u003c/pre\u003e",
