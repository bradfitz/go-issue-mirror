Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat does 'go version' print?\ngo version go1.3 darwin/amd64\n\n\nTesting: \n\nTesting require setup and tearDown function in test case file wide, \nlike the test framework like\nrspec(\u003ca href=\"http://old.rspec.info/documentation/before_and_after.html)\"\u003ehttp://old.rspec.info/documentation/before_and_after.html)\u003c/a\u003e\nEach test case can have a setup method to allow do some setup stuff, like create a DB\nconnection or start a HTTP server etc.\n\nAfter the test case, can have a function clear some up, so a lot of duplication setup in\neach test case can be avoid. \n\nI think rspec is really have a good point,  but Golang can at least add some function\nlike, TestSetup () and TestEnd() function in each test file to archive same propose.\u003c/pre\u003e",
