I would think that the server does not send the root-ca cert but the golang application might still use it from 'local' store so to say to validate the chain. But I'll check this too - what certs the server sends out - usually it should only be the cert itself as all systems have the root and the intermediary available locally.\r\n\r\nWell, so there seems to be an issue with the openssl config and the way the root-ca cert is selfsigned - I'll check this. Thanks for the ASN.1 playaround ;-). Will check this soon!",
