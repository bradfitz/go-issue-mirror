	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo 1.6.2  though this issue was also present on go version 1.3.x\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nwindows/amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nThe SQL-Driver I'm using (https://github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb) tries to do a Handshake() with a MSSQL-Server, which then fails due to a parsing error:\r\n\"TLS Handshake failed: tls: failed to parse certificate from server:\r\nparsing time \"203008210000Z\" as \"20060102150405Z0700\": cannot parse \"Z\" as\r\n\"05\"\"\r\n\r\nBrad Fitzpatrick suspected (Back when this was first encountered) that it has to do with missing seconds in the certificate. (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/5A3QbXn2cRU)\r\n\r\nI can not provide a sample certificate as of yet, but I will try to provide one at a later point. I suspect that reproducing this problem with the information given should be possible, though.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI expected the missing seconds to be ignored and parsed as 0 instead.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nThe above error.\r\n\r\n",
