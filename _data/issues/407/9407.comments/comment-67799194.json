	"body": "I suspect the problem is that go.tools.TMP is created relative to the current builder directory. If builder executes 2 different builds simultaneously (and windows builder does run 386 and amd64 together), then it is possible both builds are trying to clone https://go.googlesource.com/tools to the same directory ./go.tools.TMP.\r\n\r\nIt is easy enough to make unique directory in /tmp to overcome that, but other code (that moves go.tools.TMP into its final destination is suspect too). Maybe it does not matter.\r\n\r\nI can send CL to change go.tools.TMP location. Cannot think of anything else to do. What do you think, Brad?\r\n\r\nAlex",
