I had to use \"/usr/local/go/bin/go\" because the \"system-wide\" /etc/environment is\nignored by \"sudo\"\n\n2. here the hello executable was generated as expected\n\n3. After changing the \"x\" flag of the hello executable, it was running fine.\n\nSo the problem is that without sudo \"go build\" can't use the \"/tmp\" directory to compile\nhello.go.\n\nHow can my program invoke \"go build\" without sudo?\n\nThis program is run by the logged user who is part of the 'root' group and should\nnormally iheritate the user credentials. I am lost and will gladly welcome help.\n\nPlease find attached the strace (edited to remove the huge irrelevant portions).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4407/2/go.txt\"\u003ego.txt\u003c/a\u003e (13539 bytes)",
