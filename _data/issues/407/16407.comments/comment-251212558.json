	"body": "@mschoch : I've been experimenting on CL 30163 which changes the way phis are inserted.  It takes 8 minutes there.  I wasn't expecting big differences with tip as both tip and that CL take about the same amount of time for phi building on your example.  However, it looks like tip is going to take much longer (still running).  I don't understand why, as the phi building takes about the same amount of time.  For some reason, the differences in phi building make later phases take longer.\r\nLooks like generic CSE is at least the first such phase.",
