	"body": "See #10749.\r\n\r\nI propose to make the compiler translate various VFP instructions into\r\ndirect call to software floating point functions.\r\n\r\nThere might be even more optimizations available, because the compiler\r\nknows GOARM now, so we can completely change the way GOARM=5\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nOnce we have another architecture (mips) that also needs software\r\nfloating point, then this approach makes even more sense as we don't\r\nneed to write anther FP instruction decoder in runtime.",
