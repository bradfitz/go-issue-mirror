People who want fast floating point use hardware.\n\nAlso, I actually quite like the current approach because it has just one encoding instead of two when looking at the binaries. And in theory you could NOP out the calls to sfloat to turn a software float binary into a hardware float binary. \n\nA MIPS FP instruction decoder does not sound like a lot of code. Maybe 100 lines?",
