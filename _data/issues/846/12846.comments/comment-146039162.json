Why that is required is a mystery to me, but it is required.  (It's not required for linux/amd64 nor darwin/amd64, which we use extensively.)\r\n\r\nI bet iant@ knows why this is required as he added these flags to tests in \"misc/cgo/testcshared\", which is how I found out the solution to my woes.  (It fails in \"save_g\" otherwise, trying to access the G pointer from TLS.)",
