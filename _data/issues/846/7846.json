	"body": "by **emanuelpalm**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003ego version 1.2 linux/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/d5qCvqjhhe\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/d5qCvqjhhe\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat happened?\n\nBasically some slices are treated as of type interface{} when used with json.Unmarshal,\neven when they should have enough type information to be treated as of being of some\nspecific type.\n\nThis deals with a true corner case I believe few would be interested in, and it might\neven be some design decision made to simplify the implementation of\njson.Unmarshal/json.Decode/etc. A good defense of the behavior observed would be\nregarded as resolving the issue.\n\nThank you for making Go great!\u003c/pre\u003e",
