We could conditionally provide/expose\nC.WcharString() (or C.CWString() or whatever) only if the C compiler defines that macro,\nand then I don't think we need to rely on any external libraries like libiconv.\n\nI think the only nit would be how to handle code points greater than WCHAR_MAX.  ISO C\ndoesn't specify how to handle that case, but in practice it seems like encoding\ncharacters using UTF-{8*sizeof(wchar_t)} should work.  Varying the implementation\ndepending on sizeof(wchar_t) might be a tad involved, but nothing really out of the\nordinary from what cgo already has to do I think.\u003c/pre\u003e",
