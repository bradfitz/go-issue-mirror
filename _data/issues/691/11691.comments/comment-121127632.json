	"body": "The conversion of a color.YCbCr to RGBA now has finer detail. The RGBA method has always returned 16-bit color, but prior to Go 1.5, the low 8 bits equalled the high 8 bits. The following code:\r\n\r\nvar c color.YCbCr = etc\r\nr, g, b, a := c.RGBA()\r\nfmt.Println(\"Red (in the range [0-255]):\", uint8(r))\r\n\r\nhas always been incorrect, but coincidentally printed the right number prior to Go 1.5. The correct code replaces \"uint8(r)\" with \"uint8(r \u003e\u003e 8)\". Even so, the number printed can differ slightly between Go 1.5 and previous versions.",
