Here's a floating point analogy: you can think of red, green, etc. values being between 0 (no red) and 1 (fully saturated red). In the equivalent of Go 1.4, converting a particular YCbCr color to RGBA would yield something like '0.1 red'. In the equivalent of Go 1.5, it would yield something like '0.102 red'. The actual number is different; it is more accurate.",
