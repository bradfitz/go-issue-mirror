However keep in mind this is actually a pretty serious bug,\nas many heavy-hitting XML framework/super-libraries are pedantic about checking that\ncharacters are valid. So the result of Marshal and Escape will cause errors in some\nother process down the line. The case I have is in a SAX parser in some Java process I\ndon't control which abrubtly explodes when reading an attribute with a '\\0' in it.\n\nAt least Marshal could return an error, and a CheckedEscape or something to that effect\ncould be used that allows returning an error.\n\nAnother idea is to add a function that will check a string for valid codepoints, which\ncould be used either before or after Escape, or whenever user code feels like it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
