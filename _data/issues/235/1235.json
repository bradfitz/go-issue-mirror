However, it seems that I am unable to do this.  I have tried\nexporting CFLAGS and LDFLAGS before running all.bash, but it appears that these\nvariables are overwritten somewhere in the build system.\n\nI need to know how to pass my package manager's CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to go's build system.\n Any help you can give me would be appreciated.\u003c/pre\u003e",
