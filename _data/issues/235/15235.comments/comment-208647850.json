Most of the stack trace pasted is from the go tool, not from the compiler.\r\n\r\nAlso, if possible, try generating a 1k or 5k or 10k or 50k or 100k line slice literal and see whether it completes, albeit slowly. If so, we could get a cpu profile out.\r\n\r\nIf I had to guess, I'd say that the culprit is CSE, and that this is going to be a duplicate of #15112.\r\n",
