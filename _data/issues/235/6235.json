	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eI'm writing a SSH server implementation that uses the Go SSH server. I need to send an\nexit-status and exit-signal channel messages upon completion of a server-side task. I\ndon't see a way of using the exported members to do this. For now, I've written an\nextension to the Channel interface that is SendExitStatus(code uint32), but I'm not sure\nthis makes sense since Channel is also used client-side.\n\nI'd be happy to contribute a patch to implement something acceptable. What do you think\nis the right approach? I will eventually also need a way to obtain a parsed\nterminal-width and pty-req message.\n\n(Aside: I'm also working on server-side handling of SSH certificates. I'd be happy to\nhelp out with go.crypto/ssh in other areas, too.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
