	"body": "by **achowe**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eDownloaded the source build to OpenBSD 4.3 system. Proceeded to unpack and build. Build\nfails because scripts assume \u0026quot;bash\u0026quot; shell, which is NOT a portable assumption. \n\nFor portability across platforms, shell scripts should assume a Bourne shell (sh) or\nPOSIX / SUS Korn shell (ksh). OpenBSD and NetBSD provide these as standard. Bash is a\nLinux version of the Korn shell and should not be assumed to present or exist by that\nname on all systems.\n\nFor portability across multiple platforms use /bin/sh (or /bin/ksh).\u003c/pre\u003e",
