I guess you're fine with that, but just want the tool to stop complaining thereafter?  But if you're already fine with the user having to configure the repo to commit elsewhere, maybe instead we add a mechanism to shut up the warning... some sort of \"yes-i-know-you-don't-like-this-location-but-it's-cool-trust-me\" flag.  Then if the upstream URL for authors is secret (e.g. some internal corp URL), you don't have to leak it publicly too.\r\n\r\n",
