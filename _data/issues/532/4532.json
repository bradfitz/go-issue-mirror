	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIn the spec we use the following phrases:\n\n1) integer value\n2) value of integer type\n3) value of type int (or int8, int16, etc)\n4) representable as a value of type int (or int8, int16, etc)\n\nThey are very similar in English but mean different things in the spec:\n\n1) -\u0026gt; a (typed or untyped) constant value that is integer (1, 2.0, -4.0 + 0i)\n2) -\u0026gt; a typed value that has one of the signed/unsigned integer types (byte, int,\nuint8, etc.)\n3) -\u0026gt; a value of a concrete type int, int8, etc.\n4) -\u0026gt; a value that can be represented w/o loss of accuracy as a value of a specific\ntype\n\nWe should clean this up, and/or introduce a section explaining the nomenclature. As is,\nthe English differences are small, but the spec implications are large.\u003c/pre\u003e",
