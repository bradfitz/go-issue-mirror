	"body": "My patch fix the situation that the path was deleted and retrying to remove the watch is useless. But if `InotifyRmWatch` returns error due to other problems which we don't know if retry helps, I think maybe we need to add a `forceRemove bool` field to `func (w *Watcher) RemoveWatch(path string) error`. If forceRemove is set, we delete keys from watches and paths map even if error returns.",
