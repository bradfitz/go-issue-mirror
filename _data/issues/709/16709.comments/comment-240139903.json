If a directory was deleted and then RemoveWatch is called it will still error without deleting the watch internally.\r\n\r\nI propose that we just move the internal deletes up and keep the error handling the same. That way users can handle the error as they see fit but the watch is cleaned up properly internally.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/agorman/exp/commit/93822845401277baa4dd15f54f13bc9c84ae2b69\r\n\r\n",
