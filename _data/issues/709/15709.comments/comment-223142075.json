It's possible that some implementations may be sensitive to how the handshake is cut up into packets and that's very hard to predict.\r\n\r\nIf you're happy using the beta process to test it then I've no problem with it landing. (I'm not sure how to write a good test for it, however, because it's inherently about a race. I think counting the number of writes in a handshake might be the best solution.)",
