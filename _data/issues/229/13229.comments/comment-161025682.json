	"body": "I was unable to compile your code because it depends on external libraries\nthat I can't make math/big depend on. I was going to make it use math/rand\nbut have not had time. I also did not understand the code. It is quite\nnon-idiomatic as far as naming and structure, and at a macro level is\nsimply not written the way Go benchmarks usually are. So I wanted to try to\nunderstand it a bit more before running it, to make sure I believed it was\na correct benchmark, and I haven't had time.\n\nRight now my main focus is trying to get Go 1.5.2 and then Go 1.6 out the\ndoor. When things settle down a bit I intend to return to trying to\nunderstand the code and its performance characteristics.\n\nThanks.\n",
