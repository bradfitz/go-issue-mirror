Please bear with me.\r\n\r\nCan you update the CL you sent out with Go benchmarks (in the sense of package testing's benchmark support) demonstrating the timings (for MR(n=1) and BPSW)? I'd like to run them on a few different machines.\r\n\r\nIf it's the case that, as suggested above in the preliminary MR(n=1) numbers, that the cost of the BPSW test is roughly the same as n=1, then one possible proposal for the API is to change ProbablyPrime to do what it has always done (n rounds of MR) followed by a BPSW test. Then old code would automatically improve in accuracy at minimal performance cost. But again I'd like to see the numbers more clearly and try them on a few different machines first.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
