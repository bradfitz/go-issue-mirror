In function doc we clearly inform users of what we use for each n and what the success guarantees are.\r\nFor a composite, failure rate of a single MR is 1/4. For BPSW:\r\n\r\nBPSW is available since 1980, people have tried every available prime \u0026 composite on the planet and it stood the test of time. It has a sound well-studied algorithm, notice it is an extension of MR. No serious library/language/software uses only MR for testing. Everybody suplements MR with a Lucas(jacobi=-1).\r\nThey \"complement\" each other. Blindly rejecting this without reading the relevant literature is a deep ignorance \u0026 shame for the Go project.\r\n\r\nThis is probabilistic primality testing, as the name suggests. We dont claim to have a primality proof in the first place. This does not mean we can provide lousy algorithms to users. On the contrary BPSW is the state-of-the-art primality testing.",
