MR(base=x) (x with multiple Word's) was faster than MR(base=2).\r\nNow on my ubuntu laptop, for generating 1000 random odd ints i am getting:\r\n\r\n// 501 to 512 bits, 5 of them are primes\r\nMR(n=40) took 95 ms\r\nBPSW took **60 ms** (was 145 ms)\r\n\r\n// 1013 to 1024 bits, 4 of them are primes\r\nMR(n=40) took 450 ms\r\nBPSW took **297 ms** (was 570 ms)\r\n\r\nBPSW is now unconditionally faster than MR(n=40) in all practical cases (except pseudoprimes-to-base 2 only of course).",
