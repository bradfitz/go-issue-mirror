What if there are even better tests\nin the future? (Say if a future version of AKS primality test become\npractical or a probability version of deterministic AKS primality test.)\n\nIf we want to add it to math/big, we should choose another name.\n\nBut then what should the user choose? There is no proof that\nBaillie-PSW doesn't have false positives, but there is clear and\nwell-understood bound for Miller-Rabin test giving false positives.\n\nPerhaps we can add it to a x/math subrepo and see how many\npeople actually cares about the speed of primality testing and\nalso willing to take the risk of using algorithm with unproven result.\n",
