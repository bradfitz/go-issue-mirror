	"body": "Yep, I've already got a patch synthesizing auxv for arm, it's easy enough. Interestingly it seems to work, and then panic randomly later in my program in debug mode, when it usually passes when reading from /proc/self/auxv. I've verified with printstring that everythin in os_linux_arm.go is getting the right value, so it must be something else. Still investigating.\r\n\r\nx86/amd64 is a problem for another day. First up is getting the builder working in debug mode.",
