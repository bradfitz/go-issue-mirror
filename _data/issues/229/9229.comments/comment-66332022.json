It does not work on some platforms some of the time, as noted here: \r\nhttps://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/51271/1/sources/android/cpufeatures/cpu-features.c\r\n\r\n/* IMPORTANT:\r\n   *   Accessing /proc/self/auxv doesn't work anymore on all\r\n   *   platform versions. More specifically, when running inside\r\n   *   a regular application process, most of /proc/self/ will be\r\n   *   non-readable, including /proc/self/auxv. This doesn't\r\n   *   happen however if the application is debuggable, or when\r\n   *   running under the \"shell\" UID, which is why this was not\r\n   *   detected appropriately.\r\n   */\r\n\r\nI'll try and find another way.",
