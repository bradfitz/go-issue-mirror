The :0 indicates frames for which the\nbacktrace library couldn't find any debug info.  Most likely they are in libc.  The\nbacktrace library doesn't yet understand how to find separate debug info files.\n\nProbably the fix should be, for a frame with no debug info, to just print the PC value.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **gccgo**, removed **priority-triage**._",
