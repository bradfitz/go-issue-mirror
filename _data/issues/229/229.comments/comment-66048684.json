You write that\n\n\u003e Python for example does not have this and you have to read through the\n\u003e whole text just to find specifics about the return value\n\nThis is a symptom of badly written, overly verbose documentation; adding more \nsection headings does not make it good documentation.\n\nFor me at least godoc is working great as is.\u003c/pre\u003e",
