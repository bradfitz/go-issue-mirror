That doesn't mean everybody would see it, but not everybody always does.\r\n\r\n\u003e I think removing it without prior notice will break a lot of //go:generate lines.\r\n\r\nThat's okay.\r\n\r\n1. we don't guarantee stability of tools. Only API.\r\n2. this doesn't break building of programs or end users. It only breaks developers updating their programs. They're by definition already changing stuff, so they can change their go:generate line too.\r\n",
