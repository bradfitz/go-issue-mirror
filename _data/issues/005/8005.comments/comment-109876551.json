If this is going to happen, it needs an owner who will push on getting it discussed and done during the main cycle.\n\nI do think this might be worth doing, with the vet check. (Separately, I want to make vet a bit more central to the dev process for 1.6 somehow. Rob filed a bug for that, but I don't have the number handy. If that happened, the main objection to vet goes away.)\n\nNot sure about the name. For what it's worth, DISALLOW_EVIL_CONSTRUCTORS seems to be available again. :-)",
