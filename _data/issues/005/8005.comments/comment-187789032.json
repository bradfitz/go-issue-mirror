This isn't really about runtime at all. It's about a pseudo-compiler check.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e We established a convention for special comments: \"//who:something\", where who says who the comment is for. We use //go: for the Go compiler. Following that convention seems like it would suggest \"//vet:nocopy\" as a special comment. Or if for some reason vet is unable to use comments (possible but unfortunate if so) then maybe use any type named 'vetNoCopy' in any package. Either way, please leave it out of runtime (and the whole standard library).\r\n",
