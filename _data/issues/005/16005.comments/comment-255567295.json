	"body": "Found it. The fact that the `http.Transport` is not collected in this program is not a bug.\r\n\r\nThe only reason the Transport isn't being collected is because of the finalizer. If you remove the finalizer, it will be collected (you can see this clearly by setting `GODEBUG=allocfreetrace=1`).\r\n\r\nIn general, you should never set a finalizer on an object you didn't implement because you don't know if it may participate in a cycle, or if the internal implementation already uses a finalizer. In this case, setting the finalizer causes it not to be freed because it participates in a cycle where `Transport.h2transport` points to an `http2Transport` object and `http2Transport.t1` points right back at the `Transport`. (Awful GDB script for finding the path from a GC root to an object [here](https://gist.github.com/aclements/5872f2b521ced4dd8d0b5e2fb4f88957).)",
