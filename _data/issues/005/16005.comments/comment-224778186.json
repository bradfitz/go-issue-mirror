If you don't close those connections or re-use the Transport, you will leak Transports.\r\n\r\n\u003e relationship between this issue and ExpectContinueTimeout looks weird for me.\r\n\r\nHmm, well `ExpectContinueTimeout` disables http2 in the client, so maybe that's related. You're saying that you see Transports escaping even if you don't call `CloseIdleConnections`?\r\n",
