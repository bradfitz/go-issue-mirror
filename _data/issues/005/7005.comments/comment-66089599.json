Historically Linux didn't\nsupport socket-\u003esocket sendfile/splice.  That came later.  Go supports the minimum to be\nable to serve static files efficiently.  Any use of more modern kernel features would\nhave to fall back gracefully if the kernel didn't support it.\n\nAlso, we don't use the bug tracker for sending or discussing patches.  See the\ncontributing docs for how to use the hg plugins.\u003c/pre\u003e",
