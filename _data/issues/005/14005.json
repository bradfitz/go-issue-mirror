	"body": "The ellipsis `/...`  expansion doesn't seem to follow links. For instance, if I have a package `./path/to/package` in my working directory, which is under `$GOPATH` and I do the following:\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir testpackage\r\n$ ln -s ./path/to/package testpackage\r\n$ go test ./testpackage/package/...\r\n```\r\nI get the following error:\r\n```\r\nwarning: \"testpackage/package/...\" matched no packages\r\nno packages to test\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this expected? Where can I read about the `/...` expansion mechanism more? How can I overcome this issue and get correct expansion for the linked files?",
