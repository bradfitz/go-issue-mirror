	"body": "I accidentally typoed `go test . ./...` in a build script and noticed an interesting trap: the first `.` may be executing tests while the second `.` from `./...` tries to open the same executable for writing, leading into a \"text file is busy\" message, if the timing is just right.\r\n\r\nI would have expected either different temp file names, or `go test` to only run test for a package once, even if it was listed twice.\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out to me that `go test fmt fmt fmt` already runs the `fmt` tests just once, so this probably is about the `...` logic not participating in the uniquify.",
