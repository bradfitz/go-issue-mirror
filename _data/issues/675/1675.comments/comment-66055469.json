But forbidding them because they allow\npoor design is not a solution to me. Because when you really need them (and it happens\nquite often) you must use one of the \"tricks\" I mentioned in my first post.\nWhen you write two or three or more functions that call each other to support every\nusecase, you write a lot of stupid code. My proposition is just to let the compiler\nwrite this code for you. This is not bad design, it's just syntactic sugar.\nBut maybe you are considering it's up to a project like Groovy or CoffeeScript to do\nthis job for us?\nAnd finally, I found no argument about this in the link you gave to me :(\u003c/pre\u003e",
