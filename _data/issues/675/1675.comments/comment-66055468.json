You tend to think \"Oh well,\nwe can always add it later as an optional argument.\" Or (worse) \"Just add it as an\noptional argument.\" The result (as demonstrated by many Python programs) is functions\nthat take many optional arguments whose semantics are hard to discern.\n\nGo has design goals, which are discussed at length in this article:\n\u003ca href=\"http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article\"\u003ehttp://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article\u003c/a\u003e\nIn reading that article, it should become clear why optional arguments are a no-go for\nGo.\nIf you do not share those goals, then you are probably better off using another\nlanguage.
