I'm still unable\nto get an i386 version of this put together -- partially because I\ndon't have a FreeBSD/i386 machine, and also partially because\ncross-compiling and running the 386 binary on the amd64 machine just\ndoesn't work for me when I try to set it up \"properly.\"\n\nI'd definitely appreciate input / suggestions for how to go about\nthis, because the \"straightforward\" fix doesn't seem to work and my\nknowledge of i386 is significantly worse than my knowledge of amd64.\n\n--dho\u003c/pre\u003e",
