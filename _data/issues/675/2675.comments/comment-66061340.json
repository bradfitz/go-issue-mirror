I missed the updates here in the floods of stuff in my inbox.\n\nYeah, this is indeed a 386 crossbuild (though for some reason I thought it was a 386\nmachine). This machine has 32-bit compat installed, but I'm in the process of upgrading\nit to RELENG_9 right now, so it'll be a bit before I can test this again. (Previously\nwas RELENG_8).\u003c/pre\u003e",
