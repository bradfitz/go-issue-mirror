Most of the time it worked.\n\nThanks to Neel Natu (FreeBSD developer) for finding this.\n\nThe s/JCC/JAE/ a few lines later is a no-op but makes the\ntest match the rest of the file. Why we write JAE instead of JCC\nI don't know, but the two are equivalent and the file might\nas well be consistent.\n\nLGTM=bradfitz, minux\nR=golang-codereviews, bradfitz, minux\nCC=golang-codereviews\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/99680044\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/99680044\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
