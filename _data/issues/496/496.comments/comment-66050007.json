Given it's more of a pattern if anything.\nI've been using it in PHP for years. You can read more here:\n\u003ca href=\"http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/aspect-oriented-programming-in-php--net-24974\"\u003ehttp://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/aspect-oriented-programming-in-php--net-24974\u003c/a\u003e ... and\nI use it with the Lithium framework. I'm trying to see if there are any packages that\nhelp out with it myself, stumbled upon this (and some other questions)...and kept\nscratching my head. Why isn't anyone using AOP in Go?\n\nMy interests are in the organization and separation of concerns more than any\nperformance considerations though. Perhaps it's just not a super popular thing to do.\u003c/pre\u003e",
