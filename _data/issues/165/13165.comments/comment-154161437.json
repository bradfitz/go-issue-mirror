	"body": "This is because `http.conn.closeNotify` is internally using an unbuffered pipe. Pipelining puts the server in an awkward place: if the client has sent two pipelined requests, the server can no longer detect abandoned connections unless it consumes and buffers the incoming data (up to some reasonable limit). It would be straightforward to add a buffer here but I'm not sure if it's worth it since pipelining is generally (to my knowledge) rare (and should only become more rare, as use cases that benefit from pipelining move to HTTP/2). Even in the case that prompted this investigation, the pipelining was unintentional: it was a result of a connection-reuse bug in the client library. So if it were up to me I probably wouldn't make a change here; it's just one of the several cases in which `CloseNotifier` cannot promptly detect a closed connection.",
