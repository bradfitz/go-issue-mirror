However , If I want to create a new thread that can callback Go Code, what need I do?\r\n\r\nBTW, In my program, when I remove code\r\n```\r\n f, _ := os.Create(\"cpu.prof\")\r\n    err := pprof.StartCPUProfile(f)\r\n    if err != nil {\r\n        fmt.Println(\"pprof.StartCPUProfile:\", err)\r\n    }\r\n    defer pprof.StopCPUProfile()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe program run well.\r\n\r\nI think the CPU profile have the effect on the  callback\r\n\r\n",
