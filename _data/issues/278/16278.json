	"body": "We now have a best-effort check+fail if a map is concurrently accessed by two goroutines, one of which is a write.  (This is a bug in the user's code.)  That check is incomplete in the the iterator code path.\r\n\r\nIterators should be considered a read in all circumstances.  The check in mapaccessK only happens when iterating during a grow.  That check should be moved to mapiternext so it executes for all iterators.\r\n\r\n@rsc @josharian \r\n",
