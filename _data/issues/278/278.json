	"body": "by **mkoistinen**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Run this code:\n--- snip snip ---\npackage main\nimport . \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\n\nfunc main() {\n\tPrintf(\u0026quot;Test of Printf() string '+.3e': [%+.3e] [%+.3e] [%+.3e]\\n\u0026quot;, 0.0,\n-1.5, 10000.5);\n}\n--- snip snip ---\n\nOutput should be: \nTest of Printf() string '+.3e': [0.000e+00] [-1.500e+00] [1.000e+04]\n\n2. Notice the lack of the '+' sign in front of the returned 1st and 3rd values\n\n3. Compare to specification in `man printf` on your system\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThe output SHOULD be: \n... [+0.000e+00] [-1.500e+00] [+1.000e+04]\n\nAlso, same for the ' ' flag, which should put a space before positive\nnumbers instead of the '+' symbol above.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nGOARCH=amd64\nGOOS=darwin\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\u0026gt; hg identify\ncb140bac9ab0 tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nSorry if this has already been fixed since this version, but I am working\non code for another system, and must maintain the same version locally as\nthe remote system.\u003c/pre\u003e",
