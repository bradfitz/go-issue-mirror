	"body": "@ianlancetaylor We had code which received such struct from C, struct looks like:\r\n```\r\nstruct dm_deps {\r\n\tuint32_t count;\r\n\tuint32_t filler;\r\n\tuint64_t device[0];\r\n};\r\n```\r\nBefore in go we just had cool struct with field device, which was sorta slice, at least range worked with it, like `for _, d := range deps.device`. Now there is no field at all. So only way is to get pointer and cast it to slice, right?",
