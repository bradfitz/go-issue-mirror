This was rejected as it might be considered\nsetting a precedent for writing markup.\n\nAre two blank lines still considered \"markup\"?  Allowing (in addition\nto the current, selective rules) two blank lines to indicate \"next\nline is heading\" would solve this issue and \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/7349\"\u003eissue #7349\u003c/a\u003e as well.\n(And I still like the visual gap in plaintext code.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
