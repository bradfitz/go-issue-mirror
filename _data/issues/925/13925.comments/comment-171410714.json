That means that ConnState\r\n        // can not be used to do per-request work; ConnState only notes\r\n        // the overall state of the connection.\r\n        StateActive\r\n```\r\n\r\nConnState is mostly used for graceful shutdowns of servers. If you want to adjust read and write deadlines per-request, you'll also need to install a http.Handler wrapper which does that (cooperating with the ConnState hook to map between the net.Conn and the http.Request.RemoteAddr)\r\n",
