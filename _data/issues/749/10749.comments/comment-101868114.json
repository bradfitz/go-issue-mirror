	"body": "One of the reason is perhaps the floating point functions are slow\n(@griesemer, the code is at runtime/softfloat64.go, do you see any\nobvious performance problems?)\n\nThe other problem is the unnecessary overhead is too big. We encode\nthe VFP instructions into the binary, and then put a call _sfloat before\na block of VFP instructions. The _sfloat function will read the\ninstructions,\ndecode them and emulate them.\n\nWe have to use this approach because we used to lay out instruction\nonly during linking (pre-liblink days), so the compiler doesn't know if\nwe're targeting GOARM=5 or GOARM=6/7. Now that the compiler\nknows GOARM, we can definitely do better. I filed #10846 for the\noverhead problem.\n",
