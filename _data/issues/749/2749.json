It assumes\nthis is build.Path[1] when build.Path contains \u0026gt;1 entry.\nIt also assumes that build.Path[0] is the $GOROOT tree.\nNeither of these is guaranteed, because build omits \ntrees that failed to be created.  Build should instead leave\ntrees with the asked-for directory names.  If they don't\nwork, they don't work.  That's fine.\u003c/pre\u003e",
