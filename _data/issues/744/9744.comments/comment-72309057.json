And it's debatable\r\nwhether to discard the read error or the write error.\r\n\r\nIf we change it to return the Read error, then I think it shouldn't issue\r\nthe Write call at all. Because the io.Copy has already failed.\r\nHowever, on the other hand, we all know that's not the correct way\r\nof dealing with the result from io.Reader.\r\n\r\nWe could also interpret the docs in a different way. Because it's\r\ncopying between dst and src, the Read and Write operation should\r\nalways appear in pair if the n returned from Read is non-zero (the\r\nRead did succeed in some sense), and the first error is indeed\r\ncoming from Write.\r\n\r\nBTW, could network connections return (n, err) with n \u003e 0 and err != nil?\r\nI think the underlying read syscall doesn't expose this capability.",
