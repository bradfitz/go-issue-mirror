The documented behavior is simpler (easier to understand and document)\r\n    1. Existing users are more likely to expect the documented behavior (more likely to have read the docs than to have read the code.)\r\n    1. In case the two errors share a common underlying cause, keeping the error that happened first (in time) may be more helpful than the second.\r\n",
