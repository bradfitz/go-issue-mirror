	"body": "Thanks a lot for your time and explanation. \r\n\r\nNow that I know the original purpose of the stringer tool (*a simple, well-defined tool that demonstrates the use of go generate*) and after thinking about the implementation details of my proposal, it may go out of that simple goal. \r\n\r\nHowever, what I would really dislike is to have another tool just to generate the counterpart of `stringer`: it would duplicate de number of `go generate` calls, the number of generated files, etc.\r\n\r\nSo I will create a tool that extends the stringer functionality adding what I proposed. \r\n\r\nThanks again and keep making Go more awesome than it already is ;-)",
