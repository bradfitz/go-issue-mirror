	"body": "For the exact thing you're asking, this is reasonable, but the general problem is the one that is more useful and  more intricate that the Stringer problem. The mapping is not a bijection because of duplicate values, an issue that is straightforward to address if one uses a map but Stringer tries hard to be very dense, data-wise. That requires some thought.\r\n\r\nThe exact name of the Go symbol is useful only in a narrow context unlikely to be relevant to users. Are \"Aspirin\" and \"aspirin\" the same? What about \"ASPIRIN\"? What about \" Aspirin\"? And so on. The answers to these questions will vary with the program and programmer. And as you mention, there is the question of how to handle erroneous values. Attempting to have Stringer address them will open a configuration can of worms that will take it far from its original purpose, which was a simple, well-defined tool that demonstrates the use of go generate.\r\n\r\nSo we're tipping into issues about cases and folding and white space and data structures and so on. This is not a flag for Stringer, this is a new tool.",
