	"body": "In general you should not depend on most of these variables surviving to appear in the DWARF info.  For instance, a9 never has to exist.  A lot of the other variables only exist because we need to call convT2E on them, and to do so we need to put their values on the stack.  People are thinking about optimizations to interface{} conversion which would eliminate that need for more cases.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think we are losing some name info at the moment.  Args to convT2E can be named and we're not doing that.  I'll investigate further.",
