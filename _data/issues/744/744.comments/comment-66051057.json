The decoder is case-insensitive to make it easier\nto interoperate with other JSON environments that use lower-case names\n(seemed to be the common case).  You can add a tag if you need an upper-case\nversion, and the decoder will by default accept either:\n\ntype A struct {\n    Msg string \"Msg\"\n}\n\nI was thinking about JSON-RPC, which uses \"id\", \"params\", and \"method\"\nas keys.  But looking at SmugMug's API (the only other JSON I've done)\nit's mostly mixed case, and needing to write\n\ntype A struct { Msg string \"msg\" }\n\nseems less surprising than \n\ntype A struct { Msg string \"Msg\" }\n\nIt's entirely possible that this was a bad design and the default should be\ncase-preserving.  Do you have a specific interoperability case that would\nmake an argument for or against?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
