My policy has been and remains: it should be possible for people to do h2c via a separate package, but it won't be supported by default.\r\n\r\nAll the pieces should be there now for you to glue it together yourself.\r\n\r\nFor server-side support you'll need to hijack in the `PRI * HTTP/2.0` Handler and then call http2.Server.ServerConn.\r\n\r\nSomebody should make a package to make that easier. I have other priorities, but can review CLs.",
