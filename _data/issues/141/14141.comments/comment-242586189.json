Would the Go team accept a CL to add h2c support, if it was opt-in (e.g. an `AllowH2C` flag on Server)?\r\n\r\nI'd imagine a lot of people writing backend services are pretty excited about the performance advantages of http/2, but would rather terminate TLS at a load balancer.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your hard work on http/2 thus far!",
