Looking at max, there's an unnecessary reg-reg mov in the loop in the SSA version. I'm surprised the impact is so big, but I'd guess it is because it creates a data dependency and prevents pipelining.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't see why we are doing FP adjustments, since we don't call any functions (we only reference math.b; math.Inf is inlined). That's probably a bug, but it's not responsible for the slowdown. I'll file a separate issue next week.\r\n\r\nThis should wait for 1.8.\r\n",
