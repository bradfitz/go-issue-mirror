It's not in Rat though, so I need\nto do a little dance for that, which is doable but clumsy.\n\nUse of Format requires changing the verb for the job and is limited to the standard\nbases. It works but not generally and somewhat clumsily in the context I have.\n\nThe API I had in mind was suggested by my original report: strconv's Parse and Format,\nalthough obviously the name wouldn't work for Format as it's already taken.\u003c/pre\u003e",
