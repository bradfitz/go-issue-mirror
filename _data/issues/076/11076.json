Currently you can only disable both certificate and hostname verification using InsecureSkipVerify.\r\n\r\n`https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#appendix-B.2` \r\n```\r\n...\r\nIf the client has external information as to the expected identity of\r\nthe server, the hostname check MAY be omitted.  (For instance, a\r\nclient may be connecting to a machine whose address and hostname are\r\ndynamic but the client knows the certificate that the server will\r\npresent.)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nA new boolean should be added to tls.Config named `InsecureHostnameSkipVerify`.",
