	"body": "Did a quick test and it seems for cases that are mostly ASCII we could get another speedup by replacing bytes.Buffer with []byte, byte appends in two places. This will avoid some of the overhead of the WriteRune-\u003e(if \u003eutft8.RuneSelf)-\u003eWriteByte-\u003egrow bytes.Buffer chain for writing each byte.\r\n\r\nquick test with the mentioned mock_data.csv:\r\n\r\n```\r\nname    old time/op  new time/op  delta\r\nCSV-2    1.48s ± 0%   1.10s ± 0%  -25.64%  (p=0.000 n=19+19)\r\nRead-2  5.48µs ± 0%  5.05µs ± 0%   -7.77%  (p=0.000 n=20+20)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it would work in addition to the patch from @nuss-justin. \r\n\r\nQuick prototype patch [27430](https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/27430/)\r\n\r\nIf it is deemed to be an ok tradeoff to remove the bytes.Buffer dependency i can prepare a polished patch.",
