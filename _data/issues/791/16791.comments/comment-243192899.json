	"body": "Apologies if this is the wrong place for this comment (perhaps this should be its own feature request?). I was wondering if it would be possible to implement an efficient streaming API. I'm thinking a single buffer reused reused across all rows, with calls that return a `[][]byte, error` wherein the subslices are slices into the buffer (only valid until the next hit to the API). The standard `Read()` and `ReadAll()` methods could use this API, allocating a new buffer before each call to this API so as to provide the normal guarantees that the returned slices won't be affected by subsequent calls?\r\n",
