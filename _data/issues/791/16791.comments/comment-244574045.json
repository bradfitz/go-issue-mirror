It all depends what you want to measure.\r\n\r\nIf I'm writing a command-line CSV parser, then warming it up would be unrealistic.\r\n\r\nThis is an apple/orange/pear comparison anyway. Compiled vs. interpreted + compiled vs. JIT: completely difference performance characteristics. The point is that even in the best light, the csv module could use some love.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFYI, for the record, I think you overestimate the importance of warm-up time here. PyPy uses JIT + pure Python csv. For me, it's 4x faster than the Go baseline and 2x faster than Java.\r\n\r\n(For Java, Apache Commons CSV is just not particularly fast. I chose the most \"standard\" library. If you want something faster but more complicated, look at Jackson or another library.)",
