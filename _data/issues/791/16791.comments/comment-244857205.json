Changing this back to allocate every field separately makes the delta negligible.\r\n\r\nNo, the GC doesn't trim the unreachable memory. It will only collect the whole allocation at once. But the case where a user only holds onto a single column, preventing the rest from being GC'ed, is in my experience not that common and the user can still copy the column into a new string.",
