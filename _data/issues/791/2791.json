	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWe've recently added support for showing the methods of anonymous fields in godoc as\npart of their outer type, but it seems that showing that information by default may\neasily get more confusing than helpful when one of the underlying types has more than a\nfew methods:\n\n   \u003ca href=\"http://goneat.org/lp/lpad\"\u003ehttp://goneat.org/lp/lpad\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIt's a significant growth in the perception of the API surface, and the methods that\ncome from the anonymous field are not as relevant as the methods on the type itself, so\nit's obscured considerably the interesting interface for each of the types.\u003c/pre\u003e",
