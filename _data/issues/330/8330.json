	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThis is a feature request I would be willing to implement if it is deemed appropriate.\n\nI often find myself wanting to generate large pseudo-randomly filled files for testing\nand benchmarks.  The io.Reader interface in crypto/rand is nice, but it is\nnon-deterministic by design.  Having an io.Reader interface on math/rand.Rand, paired\nwith a consistent seed, would allow consistent random number generation from run-to-run\nof tests and benchmarks.\n\nWould this be an appropriate addition to the standard library?\u003c/pre\u003e",
