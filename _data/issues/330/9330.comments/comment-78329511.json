Sensor data is provided by an internal events queue on both platforms (you can directly consume it on Android). Higher level listener/notifier structs are fed by these queues. I was thinking of adopting async APIs for all our sensor data notifiers and directly depend on the higher level layer rather than consuming/filtering \"raw\" data.",
