The implementation of the syntax-table\nis written in C.  It looks all general but in fact it's just a \nC-or-Lisp tokenizer with knobs.  It doesn't have a concept\nfor strings without escape characters alongside strings\nwith escape characters.  FWIW, sh-mode doesn't\nhighlight `\\` correctly either.\u003c/pre\u003e",
