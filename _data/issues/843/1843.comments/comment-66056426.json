I built bison 2.5 and I can confirm that it pass a const char * variable to\nyyerror, which is where this warning is coming from.  As far as I can see, we can either\nextend the sed command which creates y1.tab.c to remove the \"const\", or we can change\nyyerror to accept const char *.\n\nE.g., adding this to the sed command works around the problem:\n    s/char const \\*yymsgp/char *yymsgp/\u003c/pre\u003e",
