I started on a CL to make them a bit nicer:\n\na) collection of notes now separates multiple notes in a comment group:\n\n// TODO(x):\n// TODO(x):\n\nwill collect two TODO's rather than just the first one (and assume the 2nd one is part\nof the 1st's body). The rule is still that each note has to start at the beginning of a\ncomment; it ends at the end of the comment group or before the next note.\n\nb) When printing the notes, eliminate spurious comment-specific formatting.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Started**._",
