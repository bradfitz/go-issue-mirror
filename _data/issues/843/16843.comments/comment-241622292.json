	"body": "I have nothing specific in mind. This bug was filed as part of a triage meeting with a bunch of us. One bug (#5049) was ancient with no activity and one bug (#14162) proposed a solution instead of discussing the problem.\r\n\r\nThis bug is recognition that there is a problem, and we've heard problem statements and potential solutions (and sometimes both) from a number of people.\r\n\r\nThe reality is that there are always memory limits, and it'd be nice for the Go runtime to help applications stay within them, through perhaps some combination of limiting itself, and/or helping the application apply backpressure when resources are getting tight. That might involve new runtime API surface to help applications know when things are getting tight.\r\n\r\n/cc @nictuku also.",
