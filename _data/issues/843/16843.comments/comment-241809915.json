	"body": "I discussed all this in #14162: you can be reading GOB-encoded data from a network connection. No way to know ahead of time how big it's going to be. Or it can be some other library you don't control where a lot of data are allocated, whether a single huge slice or a lot of small allocations. The point is, you don't know how much will be allocated before you enter the library code and you've got no way to reach in there and stop things if you hit some pre-defined limit. And, as you say, if you're in a loop watching allocations, even if you could stop things, you may not get there in time. Spinning in a loop watching the memory level is grossly expensive. This needs to be tied to the allocator.",
