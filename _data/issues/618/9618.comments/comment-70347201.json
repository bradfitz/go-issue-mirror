It is referencing the first byte, not last, of an already unreferenced large object.\r\n\r\nI think this is a very common case in real world go program that people would shrink the slice without explicitly set the dereferenced part to nil. I agree that `partial gc` is hard in some cases, however can we try to do better in this case? Or are you suggesting that people should gc the shrank part themselves explicitly?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
