When you posted the code, it felt like you\nwere not aware of this long-standing discussion.\n\nfullung: I had seen this, but monitoring for some time didn't seem to show any\nsignificant memory use.  I'm now wondering a bit, though.. it looks like godoc\nmay spike in memory usage rapidly, so that may well be the issue.\n\nI'm gonna take a machine with more memory, and mark it as a duplicate for now.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Duplicate**._\n\n_Merged into issue #1511._",
