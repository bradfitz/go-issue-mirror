Because of how TestFutexsleep is structured, it's actually fine if the futex sleep in TestFutexsleep.func1 never returns (at worst, I would expect the runtime test to time out if this happened, but I'm not sure if even that would happen). I'm also fairly certain we're not depending on the syscall itself to act as a memory barrier in this case, since the synchronization happens through atomic operations on p.status and p.runSafePointFn.",
