	"body": "Export format changes will still happen, but hopefully they will be handled more smoothly. There is support for an internal version string. There's also an open issue regarding this, assigned to me (#16244).\r\n\r\nThat said, this particular situation is due to a buggy export format that made its way into various libraries which didn't get recompiled after the fix - this would have been very hard to prevent no matter what. We don't really make any guarantees that object files (and thus the embedded export data) are compatible across different compiler versions, and certainly not if built with unreleased compilers built at tip.\r\n\r\nBut going forward, the compiler will complain with a more specific error message if outdated export data is found (i.e., with the fix of #16244).",
