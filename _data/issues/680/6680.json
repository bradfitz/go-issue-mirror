	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eos.File's Readdir method calls Readdirnames, retrieves a list of names, and then calls\nos.Lstat on each one to get a FileInfo. It can happen that a directory entry appears in\nthe Readdirnames list but then the Lstat fails, if some other program deletes the\ncorresponding file between the two operations.\n\nThe Go 1.1 Readdir code handled this with some confused code that had the effect of\nputting the name in the list in a fake FileInfo with no other information. The Go 1.2\nReaddir code is cleaned up a bit and returns an error in this case. \n\nIt is not clear that returning the error is the right thing to do in general - Readdir\ncan instead return the contents that were still there the second time through. It is\nespecially not clear given that the new behavior does not match Go 1.1's behavior.\n\nIf we fix Readdir we do not need CL 16100043.\u003c/pre\u003e",
