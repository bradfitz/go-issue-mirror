As almost\n\u003e everthing depends on the runtime package, there shouldn't be any reason\n\u003e asm's cannot be run in parallel (gb runs them in parallel)\n\n\ngo_asm.h is generated by \"go tool compile\" for the package that is being\ncompiled. Watch \"go build -x math\" for details.\n\nIt's true that the only std package that uses such facilities is the\nruntime,\nbut in general, we can't compile the assembly files before building the\nGo code for that package.\n",
