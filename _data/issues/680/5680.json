	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eInstead of having to specify `json:\u0026quot;lowercase_field\u0026quot;` or similar on every\nstruct field, the JSON en/decoder could have a\n\n    SetKeyConverter(c KeyConverter)\n\nmethod. The KeyConverter would be responsible for converting struct/map keys to JSON\nkeys and vice versa.\n\n    type KeyConverter interface {\n        EncodeKey(key string) string\n        DecodeKey(key string) string\n    }\n\nThis would be much less intrusive into type declarations, and generating a different\nJSON output would simply be a matter of using another KeyConverter instead of a whole\nnew struct.\u003c/pre\u003e",
