It succeeds for a socket in a small program\nI wrote.\n\nBut, I think, our argument is pointless. If you are reporting a bug, then, please,\nprovide a reproducible example. If you are asking for a new feature, then I am not clear\nabout what you are after.\n\nIf you want new SetTTL function in net, then\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/3826\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/3826\u003c/a\u003e should be enough. If you just must\nhave access to socket handle, then you should say so. I do not see what having\n\"implement dup for netFD on Windows\" will do for you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
