The goimports feature makes code easier to write, and maintains the current easier to read Go.\r\n\r\nIf you want to claim that the language should change, that should happen on golang-nuts. If you want to claim that goimports should not be modified because the language should be changed, that is a language change and should also be on golang-nuts. If you want to argue that the language should stay the same and this should not be part of goimports at all, that should be made here. It is however, not the argument you made.",
