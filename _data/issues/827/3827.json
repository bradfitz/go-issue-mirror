Currently calling .File() on\nusers of this type returns the error \u0026quot;dup not implemented on Windows\u0026quot;.\n\nThere's no equivalent to dup for sockets on Windows. DuplicateHandle doesn't work for\nsockets, and WSADuplicateSocket has other purposes. I think it may be necessary to\nimplement an open/close ref count in addition to the completion port ref counting that's\ncurrently used.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11319025/get-syscall-handle-from-a-go-net-udpconn-on-windows\"\u003ehttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11319025/get-syscall-handle-from-a-go-net-udpconn-on-windows\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
