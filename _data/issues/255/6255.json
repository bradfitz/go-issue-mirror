	"body": "by **ehren.kret**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe readHuffman method in pkg/compress/flate/inflate.go is reusing h1 without resetting\nthe struct back to its zero-value in between reinitializations. This can cause a panic\nin go with the right corrupt input.\n\nHere is a simple test I added to flate_test.go to demonstrate the issue.\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/iHOL6GU-st\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/iHOL6GU-st\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nsecond call to init should return false rather than panic.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\npanic from the second call to init.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\ndarwin/amd64\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version devel +0a355d4d5c50 Mon Aug 26 07:41:37 2013 -0500 darwin/amd64\n\n\nI believe the correct fix in this case is to rezero h1 before attempting to reinitialize\nit at the end of the readHuffman method.\u003c/pre\u003e",
