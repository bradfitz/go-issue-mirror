Run go program on darwin/386\n2. kill -SIGPIPE the process (or if using tcp code, \u0026quot;nc\u0026quot; to it and ctrl-c)\n3. Program is killed\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nProgram should not be killed by SIGPIPE\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nGOOS=darwin, GOARCH=386\n\nWhich revision are you sync'ed to?  (hg log -l 1)\n3975:b51fd2d6c160\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nAttached a patch that uses sigprocmask to block the SIGPIPE. It seems like \nsigaction/signal don't work for SIGPIPE in threaded environments?\n\nThis issue likely affects 64-bit as well, but I don't have a machine to test it \non.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/255/0/darwin_386_ignore_sigpipe.patch\"\u003edarwin_386_ignore_sigpipe.patch\u003c/a\u003e (1486 bytes)",
