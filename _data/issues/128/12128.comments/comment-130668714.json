	"body": "The runtime discussed it and our decision is part of 1.5 as you noted. The reasoning was that 1 bit per pointer sized word on a 64 bit machine is a 1.56% memory overhead. On a 32 bit machine it is twice that. We would need some numbers that would lead us to believe that this optimization will not only pay for itself in terms of memory savings but would also pay for itself in terms of a more complicated GC. Perhaps there is a clever bit encoding we have yet to discover but things are pretty crowded in the bit map. Feel free to reopen with supporting information.",
