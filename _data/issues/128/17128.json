	"body": "In the [Interfaces and Methods](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#interface_methods) section of Effective Go, there are two mentions of `ServeHTTP` calling a function `f(c, req)` ([first occurrence](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/4466298df47fee61c31933e6fd5dde474dcfd2ad/doc/effective_go.html#L2412), [second occurrence](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/4466298df47fee61c31933e6fd5dde474dcfd2ad/doc/effective_go.html#L2450)).\r\n\r\nJudging from how `ServeHTTP` is documented in the [Go source](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/4466298df47fee61c31933e6fd5dde474dcfd2ad/src/net/http/server.go#L1724-L1727), and given the actual call in the Effective Go `ServeHTTP` example is listed as `f(w, req)`, it possibly would be clearer as `f(w, req)`.\r\n\r\nArguably, you could also change the `req` to `r` to match the server.go source, but that's less of an issue as usage is at least consistent within the documentation section.\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.7.1\r\n",
