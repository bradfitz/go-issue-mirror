Also, until there's widespread browser support, it's not interesting. I am also not interested in being the chicken or the egg to get browser support going. I'm very happy with the TLS-only situation, and things like https://LetsEncrypt.org/ will make TLS much easier (and automatic) soon.\r\n\r\nAsk me again in one year.\r\n",
