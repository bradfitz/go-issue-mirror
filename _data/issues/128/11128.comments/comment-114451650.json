Some timezones are off from their neighbors by 30 minutes, though none are -59 minutes, but that's not a bug, just an unused feature. So for TZ there's nothing to do. For year, it would be possible to return an error when a negative year is parsed. But what error is this saving users of the stdlib from? I find it to be a borderline case, and I'm leaning towards \"works as intended\".",
