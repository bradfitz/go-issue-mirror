Mutators are free to read and write the map while GC is scanning it; there's no synchronization on the map itself. The issue is that whatever thread gets picked to scan the buckets array of the map is stuck not being able to do anything else until it's scanned the whole bucket array. If there's other mutator work queued up on that thread, it's blocked during this time.\r\n\r\n(Sorry I haven't had a chance to dig into the trace you sent.)",
