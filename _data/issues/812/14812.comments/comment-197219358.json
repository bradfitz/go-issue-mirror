(i watched your gophercon talk again today :) Interestingly, when I use top, i haven't been able to ever catch a core running at 100%. \r\n\r\nBut you're right that there's essentially two things going on, which may or may not be related:\r\n* mark and scan takes too long\r\n* app slows down during GC runs, while cpu cores don't saturate.\r\n\r\nLet me know how I can help.",
