	"body": "by **jeffreydwalter**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the\nlatest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat does 'go version' print?\ngo version go1.2.1 darwin/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n1. Create a 1GB and 2GB file. In this case I just picked a random .img file off of my\ncomputer, but file format/type do not seem to be an issue in reproducing this.\nIn the following, test.1gb.img is a 1GB file, and I just cat'd it out twice to\ntest.2gb.img to make a 2GB file to test with.\n\njw$ cat test.1gb.img \u0026gt;\u0026gt; test.2gb.img\njw$ cat test.1gb.img \u0026gt;\u0026gt; test.2gb.img\n\njw$ ls -ahl\n-rw-r--r--   1 jw  staff   2.0G Apr 17 15:44 test.2gb.img\n-rw-r--r--   1 jw  staff   1.0G Apr 17 15:42 test.1gb.img\n-rw-r--r--   1 jw  staff   287B Apr 15 19:33 test3.go\n\n2. Run test3.go (attached) against test.1gb.img (the 1GB file.) Notice, it completes\nwithout error.\njw$ go run test3.go test.1gb.img \n\n3. Run test3.go (attached) against test.2gb.img (the 2GB file.) It returns with\n\u0026quot;read test.2gb.img: invalid argument\u0026quot;\njw$ go run test3.go test.2gb.img \nread test.2gb.img: invalid argument\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\nI expect that ioutil.ReadFile() would read in the 2GB file. Or at least fail more\ngracefully, or with a better error message if this isn't supported.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThis appears to be a limitation of ioutil.ReadFile() in handling files over a certain\nfile size. I was able to reproduce this with .cdr, .iso, .mp4, etc. files, so it doesn't\nappear to be related to type of file, or filename.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/7812/0/test3.go\"\u003etest3.go\u003c/a\u003e (287 bytes)",
