Did you run the program on a file that was at least 2GB in size?\n\nMy sample program is just this:\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"io/ioutil\"\n  \"os\"\n)\n\n\n\nfunc main() {\n  // Calculate the MD5 sum of all files under the specified directory,\n  // then print the results sorted by path name.\n  _, err := ioutil.ReadFile(os.Args[1])\n  if err != nil {\n    fmt.Println(err)\n    return\n  }\n}\n\nI'm not sure where you want me to put a print statement... I also don't have gdb\navailable on OSX Mavericks, as they have replaced gcc and gdb with clang and lldb. I\ntried using lldb, but am getting errors from lldb.\u003c/pre\u003e",
