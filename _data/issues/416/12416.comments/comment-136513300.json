When calling back into Go, pass the token value. The Go side uses the token to look into the map to fetch the value.\r\n\r\nIs the map a global?  That would imply contention and/or synchronization.  We don't have a notion of thread-local/Goroutine-local storage in Go, do we?  This would also need to survive a transition from Go to C to Go to make this work.\r\n",
