For the function\r\n```\r\nfunc f(x, y int) int {\r\n   return x % y\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWe want to compile it to a MOD instruction, not a DIV, MUL, and SUB.  In contrast,\r\n```\r\nfunc g(x, y int) (int, int) {\r\n   return x/y, x%y\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWe want to compile it to a DIV, MUL, and SUB instead of a DIV and MOD.\r\n\r\nThis assumes we have no DIVMOD instruction, like x86 has.  In that case, we want to use that instruction regardless (unless it is for some reason slower than DIV or MOD by itself).",
