I also tried to removing the GOBIN handling\nfrom cmd/go. However, the go tool still checks and applies GOBIN in some situations\noutside the BinDir field from go/build's Package. So I'm not fully satisfied with this\npatch, but it might be a good indication and/or be used for backward compatibility tests.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4891/2/gobin_in_build_package.diff\"\u003egobin_in_build_package.diff\u003c/a\u003e (3057 bytes)",
