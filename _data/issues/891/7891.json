	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eA common complaint about #cgo lines is that there is no way to refer to a C library\nrelative to the source directory.  A relative path is taken relative to the build\ndirectory, typically in /tmp.\n\nWe should consider supporting constructs like $ORIGIN (name taken from the ELF dynamic\nlinker, could also be SRCDIR) which expands to the path name of the source directory.\n\n#cgo LDFLAGS -l $ORIGIN/../lib\n\nI don't think we should support environment variables in general.  Just a few specific\nstrings.  Other obvious strings would $GOARCH and $GOOS.\u003c/pre\u003e",
