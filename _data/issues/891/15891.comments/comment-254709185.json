In the latter case, it is important to escape the parens.\n\nAny RFC-compliant server should treat /path(en) and /path%28en%29 the same. This code is very subtle, and I am not convinced that the benefit to broken servers is worth the risk of introducing a security problem in this code.\n\nI think we should leave this alone.\n\n/cc @mikesamuel",
