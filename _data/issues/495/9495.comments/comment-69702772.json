It's about 57 seconds on my iMac 5K i7 and VMWare Fusion Pro.\r\n\r\nThe buildlet is accessible on port 8080 from the host, if you know its IP:\r\n\r\n![buildlet](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2621/5716991/a7c8cf32-9aad-11e4-9f57-20d6239e6d45.png)\r\n\r\nAnd you can create a start-up item of a +x file named start-buildlet.command (the *.command extension is key) which launches a shell script in Terminal:\r\n\r\n![dot-command](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2621/5716992/aa0db424-9aad-11e4-8593-60951d592db1.png)\r\n\r\nWe can then snapshot that and create VMs which boot like that, in ~57 seconds. The host API server on the outside should probably cache the ~6MB buildlet too, to reduce network I/O.  We can do that later, though.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
