But if they die, they never come back to life, and we can't react to load or demand. Right now we only create one OS X 10.8 VM, 3 10.8 VMs, and the rest 10.11. That's pretty arbitrary. If four people wanted OS X 10.8 VMs via gomote, we can't create that right now.\r\n\r\nSo I want to keep this open until things are better integrated.\r\n",
