	"body": "This arose in the context of CL 9001, which @mdempsky wrote:\r\n\r\n\u003e Lastly, an alternative approach I was considering was looking into moving cmd/go's package list resolving into go/build (or an internal helper package).  Then cmd/api and deps_test.go could simply do something like ctxt.List(\"std\") without needing to run cmd/go.\r\n\r\nI have wanted this myself. I have a couple of (private) tools that shell out to `go list std` to get a listing of the stdlib's packages. It'd be nice not to have to do that.\r\n",
