	"body": "I am wondering if I am not the only one wanting something more from the go tool and its error messages. It would be amazing if error messages could be more visual like:\r\n\r\n ```bash\r\nerror: character literal may only contain one codepoint: ')\r\n --\u003e hello.rs:2:24\r\n  |\r\n2 | \tprintln!(\"Hello World\"');\r\n  | \t                      ^^\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI must say kudos to the Rust team for what really is an amazing approach. Is this something a community member would be allowed to implement or something the core team isn't interested in having fixed? As far as I know the go tool is written in go, meaning that I am both willing and able to give this a shot. I just want to verify that this is something I won't be wasting my time doing.",
