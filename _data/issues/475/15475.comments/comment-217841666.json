It makes sense to have periodical ping as proposed by @zjx20, but it would be great to have also some kind of read-only access to connection stats for both PING and GOAWAY frames (to have connection behaviour in metrics).\r\n\r\n@bradfitz: As I'm on a bit tight schedule and not sure can wait for the official fix, could You recommend some temporary solution which will allow access to ping on client side? I'm still quite green in GO and can't figure out how to extend the connection without actually forking x/net/http2 and making exported getter for Framer in http2ClientConn.",
