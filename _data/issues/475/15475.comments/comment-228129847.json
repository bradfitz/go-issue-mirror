	"body": "PING frames are also useful for measuring the true end-to-end RTT, which you can't reliably measure at the transport level due to split TCP in cellular networks. I don't have a need for this feature, but if it's implemented, I would vote for a blocking API so the caller can time the RTT. Something like:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (s *h2connection) Ping(opaque uint64) (uint64, error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you need to PING periodically, you could always do so from a timer loop.",
