I tend to do a bunch of:\r\n```\r\nconst SomePublicConstant = \"some public contant\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nGetting errors like this:\r\n```\r\nnot yet supported, name for const github.com/ppp/ppp.P9_FORMS_PART_OF_IRI untyped string / *types.Const\r\n```\r\nIs there another way for me to set this up so it works now? Perhaps wrapping everything in a singleton?",
