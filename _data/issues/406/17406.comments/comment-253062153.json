	"body": "gperftools and Go's pprof command are based on the same code, but I doubt that is in the issue.  If the same thing happens with C and Go, then the issue is almost certainly that the Darwin kernel `setitimer` call and dtrace measure different things.  The Darwin man page for `setitimer` says that `ITIMER_PROF` \"decrements both in process virtual time and when the system is running on behalf of the process.\"  That is, it measures both user time and system time.  I don't really know what dtrace measures.\r\n\r\nIf there is a bug here, it's likely to be in the kernel implementation of `setitimer`, not in any part of the Go distribution.  But further investigation will require someone familiar with the Darwin kernel.",
