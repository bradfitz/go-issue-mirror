I did however try a similar thing with a C version ([link](https://gist.github.com/lucas-clemente/437f93c71e600437b27d6996dead17f4), also needs this [go server](https://gist.github.com/lucas-clemente/c12ff5549e116e750aadda952aafe7c1)) and gperftools, and got the same result as with go pprof, with the syscall wrongly shown as taking the majority of the runtime. How much code do gperftools and go's pprof share? Is it possible there's a common bug?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to put this, but as a pprof user I would be quite unhappy if the solution was \"there's simply a difference in reporting\". In that case, we should definitely find out in what cases exactly pprof is unreliable, and document this somewhere or/and alert users on Darwin about these issues. A profiler that is sometimes wrong can cause quite a lot of lost time ;)",
