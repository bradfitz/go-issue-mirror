I don't understand how that happens, I suspect \"git\" program installed some hook (dll) on my system during its installation to intercept calls like that. I have no other explanation. I don't know of any other program that does that.\r\n\r\n\u003e Because of the strcspn in https://github.com/git/git/blob/aa826b651ae3012d1039453b36ed6f1eab939ef9/run-command.c#L161, I think git may be starting vim.exe directly.\r\n\r\nI agree, git is doing funny buggers under the covers.\r\n\r\n\u003e Does it work in Go on Windows to do, e.g. ...?\r\n\r\n\"git var GIT_EDITOR\" says \"vi\". But I cannot run vi from command window:\r\n```\r\nC:\\dev\\go\\src\u003evi\r\n'vi' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\r\noperable program or batch file.\r\n```\r\nSame will happen, if I try to run your program.\r\n\r\nAlex",
