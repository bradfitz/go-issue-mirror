	"body": "Thanks for sharing. None of this is an official proposal yet, just thoughts towards writing a proposal document if we proceed.\r\n\r\nSo the `WatchDirectory`, etc. interfaces are essentially a way of exposing the capabilities of the underlying drivers, which only satisfy the interfaces they support?\r\n\r\n\u003e It would be nice if Watcher supports filtering etc.\r\n\r\nYes, I would like to take advantage of the kernel's filtering. It's quite different between Windows and Linux, so this again is a place where capabilities matter.\r\n\r\nThe fall back in a top-level API is to watch more events than necessary and filter them out before the user sees them. That provides a consistent behaviour, but at the cost of the kernel waking up to mention an event that is subsequently thrown away. So I would want to give the kernel some hints about what to watch.\r\n\r\nI will keep thinking on these things and I hope you will too.\r\n\r\nMy initial idea here is to build out the lower level packages and test suite. But we do need a better idea of how they will be used (as drivers or in some other way) to do this right.",
