	"body": "I think we can simplify this proposal.\r\n\r\nWhat I feel is needed right now is an`inotify` package with a test suite that is tested across all Linux platforms that Go supports. Whether that is `x/inotify`, `syscall/inotify`, or somewhere else the Go builders can reach.\r\n\r\nWe don't have a problem testing fsnotify on macOS and Windows with third-party CI services, and we don't yet have a Solaris implementation.\r\n\r\nThis separation would be a step towards fsnotify (and alternatives) focusing more on building a common high-level API and less on the low-level InotifyInit and EpollCreate1 details.\r\n\r\nPerhaps more importantly, it would really help improve confidence that changes to fsnotify aren't breaking platforms that we don't have CI testing for. That has been making me nervous about merging any pull request we get.\r\n",
