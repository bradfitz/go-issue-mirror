	"body": "by **james@abneptis.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Run a go program that will lead to runtime.newosproc being called AND is running as\nPID=1 (init).\n2. Segfault.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nNot a segfault.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nA panic backtracing to the clone() call in newosproc.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g, though my suspicion is that this issue would exist wherever linux is  the target\nplatform.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nLinux\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n~Jan 8 (git).\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThis patch fixes the panic (by commenting out the CLONE_PARENT part), but will\n(probably?) create issues for os.GetPpid and possibly other places down the line.  \n\nI'm curious also if any subtle bugs come up, so I've applied this to my build, but I\ndon't think it's fit for mainline unless someone more knowledgeable about Go's internal\nthreading model says so.  I'll let you know if I see any odd behaviors as a result of my\npatch via this bug (unless it's closed).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1406/0/patch\"\u003epatch\u003c/a\u003e (641 bytes)",
