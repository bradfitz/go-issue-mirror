	"body": "Our builders fails http://build.golang.org/log/688066e2307059052f9a0bd805045467b1edf181 with:\r\n```\r\n--- FAIL: TestSubmitInteractive (1.10s)\r\n\tutil_test.go:265: git-codereview submit\r\n\tutil_test.go:265: git-codereview submit -i\r\n\tutil_test.go:289: died\r\n\t\tstdout:\r\n\t\tstderr:\r\n\t\tgit-codereview: editor exited with: exec: \"sh\": executable file not found in %PATH%\r\nFAIL\r\nFAIL\tgolang.org/x/review/git-codereview\t94.112s\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom what I can gather, CL 16677 assumes that sh (and vim) are found in the PATH. Not so on my computer (and builders too). I tried running \"git rebase -i\" command. And that, obviously, finds and executes git.exe, which then finds (I don't know how) and executes both sh.exe and vim.exe.\r\n\r\nI don't see how we can implement this on windows. I don't use git-codereview on windows. Not for submitting anyway. So I am happy just to let this go. And skip failing test. Unless others have some good ideas.\r\n\r\n/cc @aclements\r\n\r\nAlex",
