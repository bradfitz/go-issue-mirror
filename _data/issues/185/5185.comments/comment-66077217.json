When\npoor folks like myself try to parse a go command line[0], the docs shoud explain how to\ndo that.\n\nTherefor I expect a paragraph like \"test arguments are all arguments from the first\nargument not starting with hyphen/not ending with '.go'\" in \"cmd/go\" documentation. \n\n[0] \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/elazarl/gosloppy/blob/master/instrument/buildcmd.go#L60\"\u003ehttps://github.com/elazarl/gosloppy/blob/master/instrument/buildcmd.go#L60\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
