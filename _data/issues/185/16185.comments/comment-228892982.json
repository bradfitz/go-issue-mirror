Part of the stated reason for this is to not depend on \"third party font files (whose location and availability are OS-dependent at best).\"  This doesn't address that issue, it only includes a different third party pre-rendered font face in the standard package.\r\n\r\nbasicfont already covers the use case that you mention (not being able to use freetype or perhaps any font files at all)--so unless inconsolata covers a wider range of unicode, this is only a prettier font with the same purpose, and my objection is that arbitrarily adding single font faces is a slippery slope. If you're unable to use freetype but need something better than basicfont, there's no reason to assume that this face will cover your needs either, since it has the same limitations as basicfont (other than being 8bpp, but I don't think that's the limitation stopping basicfont from being useful--it's having different sizes or style variations which make people need to go elsewhere. ) \r\n\r\nIf someone objects to freetype on licensing or other grounds but needs something better than basicfont, there's already `x/image/font/plan9font` to parse a different (more open, less common?) font file format.",
