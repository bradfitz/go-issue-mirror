An important difference between flock and fcntl is how they deal with threads in the same process:\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/29611352/what-is-the-difference-between-locking-with-fcntl-and-flock\r\n\r\nMy read is that fcntl ignores the fd (and threads) and considers whether the process holds the lock.\r\nFlock locks per fd.\r\n\r\nThe unit test TestOpen_Timeout is opening the same file twice from the same process; so flock based locking will prevent that (test PASSES) and fcntl locking will allow it (test FAILS).\r\n",
