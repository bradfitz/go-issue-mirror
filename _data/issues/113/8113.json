	"body": "by **awalterschulze**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the\nlatest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat does 'go version' print?\n\ngo1.3beta2 linux/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n1. run go tool vet -all=true -methods=false . on a project which contains a Peek(int)\nxxx method for example code.google.com/p/gocc\n2.\n3.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThis prints:\nfrontend/parser/parser.go:122: method Peek(index int) interface{} should have signature\nPeek(int) ([]byte, error)\nutil/stack.go:36: method Peek(pos int) State should have signature Peek(int) ([]byte,\nerror)\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nNothing should have been printed.\n\nOk this is debatable, since the docs clearly state that I am reaching here, but it would\nbe really nice if it was possible to run all go vet checks except one or two.\n\nI know this is possible by specifying all the go vet checks that should run, but this is\nnot elegant and when you add extra checks to go vet I have to keep my list up to date.\n\nDo you have any other suggestions?\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI think Peek(int) xxx is a really common parser/scanner method and it might be a little\nover zealous to check it with go vet, but that is just my opinion.\u003c/pre\u003e",
