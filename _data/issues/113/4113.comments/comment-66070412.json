I have tested it with for computer part of\nthe domain as well as without.\n\nChanges are as below:\nlookupFullName() instead of calling syscall.TranslateAccountName() calls\nsyscall.GetUserNameEx()\n\nThe expected behavior of GetUserNameEx() is that if the computer is not part of the\ndomain it picks the information from local OS cache else it gets from domain controller.\n\nOne quirk here is that - as per documentation (check URLs below) if the user is not in a\ndomin, GetUserNameEx() is expected to support only NameSamCompatible. But in reality, it\nactually supports NameDisplay as per test results - this is good for this issue.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms902883.aspx\"\u003ehttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms902883.aspx\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724435(v=vs.85).aspx\"\u003ehttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724435(v=vs.85).aspx\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4113/3/go_bug_4113.patch\"\u003ego_bug_4113.patch\u003c/a\u003e (2400 bytes)",
