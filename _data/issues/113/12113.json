	"title": "x/mobile/bind: byte slice parameter support without copy",
	"body": "When a Go function or method taking a byte slice is called, the current implementation \r\ncreates a copy of the arguments and passes it to the Go function. The implementation\r\nwas based on the assumption that the Go function is free to keep the slice for later use.\r\nThis prevents implementation like io.Read([]byte) where the parameter's content\r\nis modified during call. Moreover, it costs an extra copy \u0026 memory which can be significant\r\ndepending on the byte slice size.\r\n\r\nInstead, I propose to pass a slice backed by the foreign language's byte array if possible.\r\n\r\nUsers who want to keep the slice for later use have to be aware of the limitation and somehow\r\ncreate a copy for now. \r\n\r\nMore discussion on automation or tool support to detect such use cases \r\n(another kind of escape analysis) is welcome.\r\n\r\n@crawshaw ",
