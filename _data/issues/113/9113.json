	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eA go TCP server can efficiently server files to clients using the ReadFrom method, but\nif the protocol allows partial files, e.g. HTTP Range requests, we have to fallback to\ncopying all the data again for each connection.\n\nCurrently sendfile is only accessible by calling *TCPConn.ReadFrom(r io.Reader), with no\nway to set the offset and count. Internally, sendfile uses to the netFD writelock and\nfile descriptor. Doing this outside of the net package is awkward and requires putting\nthe connection into blocking mode.\n\nOne option is to special case an io.SectionReader in the sendfile implementation, though\nthis requires modifying SectionReader in a way to expose the underlying io.Reader,\noffset, and count fields.\u003c/pre\u003e",
