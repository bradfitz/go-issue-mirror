In operating systems it is common to talk about the bottom or top\nof a memory segment, with bottom corresponding to numerically lower\naddresses. In the definition of a stack, the top element is the one most\nrecently pushed. This conflicts with hardware stacks that grow from top to\nbottom of memory.\n\nFor better or worse most Go code and comments use the hardware-inspired\nterms, so that \"top of stack\" refers to the top of the stack memory (i.e.,\noldest thing on the stack) and \"bottom of stack\" refers to the bottom of\nthe stack memory (i.e. newest thing on the stack). Carl is using the data\nstructure-inspired terms, which have the opposite meaning. If you are aware\nthat the meaning may be the opposite of what you expect, you can usually\nfigure it out from context.\u003c/pre\u003e",
