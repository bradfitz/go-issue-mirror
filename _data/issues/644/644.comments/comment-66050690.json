Currently, if a key-\nvalue pair exceeds a certain size (in chars) it's simply not aligned with the rest. A\nbetter \nsolution is to make that decision on some ratio. We want outliers not to cause the \naligned composite literal to be overly wide, but at the same time, if all entries are\nwide, \nthey should be aligned. Better heuristic forthcoming.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **g...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Started**._",
