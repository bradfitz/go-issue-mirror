This is unlikely in practice, but I found myself making this assumption in a textual rewriter (and we've made this assumption in commands that update old code.google.com subrepo imports) and I was surprised that the backquoted form gets through gofmt.\r\n\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/XS-iKGjQWe\r\n\r\nWe should think about this for Go 1.5.\r\n\r\n@griesemer ",
