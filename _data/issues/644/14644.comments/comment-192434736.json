If +inf is correct then should (+inf+infi)+(+inf+infi) yield NaN+NaNi instead of +inf+infi \r\n    since unsigned infinities should not be added. \r\n\r\n2. If we treat +Inf for complex as an unsigned infinity (which 1.0+0i)/0.0 == +Inf suggests) then is it ok that real(+inf+infi) returns a signed float infinity?\r\nAnswer from myself: The spec would not allow otherwise as real and imag are the reverse of complex and x == y means real(x)==real(y) and imag(x)==imag(y)",
