I don't know if you can reproduce it locally.\r\n\r\n\u003e I'm seeing a similar bug (notok crashes on go 1.7 rc6). However, I'm not calling FreeOSMemory.\r\n\r\n@scosman, if this is what I think it is, FreeOSMemory isn't necessary. FreeOSMemory forces the scavenger to run, but it runs on its own periodically and will start releasing memory after it's gone unused for ~5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\u003e I can't work out why a smaller PhysPageSize would fix this either. But if it does, we could set it just for iOS.\r\n\r\n@crawshaw, it's not safe to reduce PhysPageSize below the actual physical page size of the system (see #9993). I don't know what the actual physical page size of iOS on ARM64 is. (https://go-review.googlesource.com/25022 will make the runtime fetch this from the OS, but I wouldn't want to put that in 1.7.) Plus, if I understand this bug, reducing it to anything more than 8K won't fix it.",
