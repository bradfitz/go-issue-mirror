What bugs in \"start\" and \"end\" are you referring to?\r\n\r\n\u003e Do we need a range which is 64KB align that is smaller than the input range? or larger?\r\n\r\nSmaller. Specifically, we need the 64KB-aligned range that is contained in the range [start, end). It was possible to get a negative range because we compute this by rounding start up to the next 64KB boundary and end down to the previous 64KB boundary. If they're already in the same 64KB region, this can cause start and end to cross over, leading to the negative range.",
