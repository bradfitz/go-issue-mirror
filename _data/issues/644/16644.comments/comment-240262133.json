This is (unfortunately) in the wild, so I have a wealth of crash reports in Crashlytics (hundreds).\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\n - happening on all version of iOS (7 though 10 at least)\r\n - bare bones stack trace in Crashlytics (right after a new thread is created, no go dump, only the usual system trace)\r\n - didn't occur on go 1.6 (exact same library)\r\n - I'm seeing hundreds of these crashes, but I don't have a consistent retro. It may have something to do with the app being resumed after being suspended, but I am still trying to verify that.\r\n - It *may* only happen when a device has low RAM (usually \u003c 10%, never over 30%). Not sure if this is related, but did seem like a major pattern in the crash reports.\r\n\r\n",
