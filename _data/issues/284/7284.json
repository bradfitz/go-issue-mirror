	"body": "by **czarek.tomczak**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eHi there,\n\nI have been successfully running Go app on a clean XP machine, but recently I have\ninstalled Windows updates (a total of 65) and now it stopped working. I get this error:\n\n    C:\\cef2go\u0026gt;cef2go\n    runtime: panic before malloc heap initialized\n    fatal error: runtime: cannot reserve arena virtual address space\n\n    runtime stack:\n\nI am testing the cef2go project, a binary demo is available here:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/CzarekTomczak/cef2go/releases\"\u003ehttps://github.com/CzarekTomczak/cef2go/releases\u003c/a\u003e\n\nNot sure if this is related, but found \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/2323\"\u003eissue #2323\u003c/a\u003e \u0026quot;runtime: windows DLL mappings\ninterfere with 32-bit memory allocation\u0026quot;.\n\nUsing Go 1.2\nWindows XP 32-bit.\nThe binary was created on Win7 64-bit using Go 32-bit version.\n\nI am running XP in a virtual machine (virtualbox 4.3.6), but I don't think this has\nanything to do, as it worked fine earlier before Windows Updates were installed. All\nother programs are working fine.\n\nBest regards,\nCzarek\u003c/pre\u003e",
