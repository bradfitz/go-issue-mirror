I am using Chromium Embedded Framework from here:\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIt integrates with multiple languages without problems. I am creating bindings for the\nGo language. I think that this is something that should be fixed in Go, and not the\nother way around.\n\nHow can I decrease the amount of memory that Go is trying to reserve?\n\nWhy Go doesn't let run application that requires less than 100 MB of ram to run? It\ndoesn't make sense to crash application when it only needs 100 MB of ram, and there is\n712 MB of continous ram available. And 3 GB of free ram in total. It just doesn't sound\nright.\u003c/pre\u003e",
