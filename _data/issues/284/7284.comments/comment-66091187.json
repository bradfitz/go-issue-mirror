Even if you have 16 GB of free ram, Windows will try to use virtual memory\njust to save the space for the future. And this will slow down applications. I've been\nrunning with virtual memory disabled for years and never had any problem with any\napplications. But seems like Go is an exception.\u003c/pre\u003e",
