If my application with its 10 processes reserves 7.36 GB of real\nmemory (of which oly 5% is used), then it leaves only virtual memory for other\napplications, and they will be running like a turtle.\n\n----\n\nI read that Go aims to replace C++. But I don't see this happening on Windows desktop\nwith these memory features. I think this is even going to be a problem on 64-bit\nsystems. The 7.36 GB allocation of continous memory is going to be as same big problem\non 64-bit system as 736 MB is on 32-bit.\u003c/pre\u003e",
