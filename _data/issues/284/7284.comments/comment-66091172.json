My application embeds Chromium browser which has a multi-process\narchitecture. When launching application besides the main process running, it launches\nat least one subprocess, the renderer process. It does so by executing the main\nexecutable with additional command line flags. So on XP I have two processes when\nstarting app. On Win7 addditionally it launches a gpu-process. It becomes more clear,\nnow after applying patch that displays memory reserved. On Win7 I see three messages, as\nit launches main process + two subprocesses.\n\n  reserving 769 MB\n  reserving 769 MB\n  reserving 769 MB\n\nI have tested Go-tip on a clean XP SP3 machine once again, it also displays reserving\n769 MB and runs fine. I see two total of two processes running in Task manager.\n\nWhen launching app on XP SP3 with Windows Updates installed I see this in the console:\n\n  reserving 769 MB\n  VirtualAlloc failed with errno=8)\n\nIn the task manager I can see only one process running for my application.\n\nUnfortunately I still cannot run vmmap after applying your patch. I get the same error\nmessages. Two message boxes, the second one appearing after 1-2 sec delay.\n\n  The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0150002).\n  Click on OK to terminate the     application. \n\nAnd:\n\n  Unable to launch application:\n  \"E:\\Release\\cef2go.exe\" \n  Error:\n  Could not open pipe to target process\n\nBefore closing these message boxes I can see in task manager only one process running\nwith 399K memory.\u003c/pre\u003e",
