Caching the raw file data\nsimply removes the system calls but still causes the gcimporter to do the import.\n\nA better solution would be to adjust the vet command such that it doesn't start with a\nclean slate for each file/package processed: If it doesn't throw away that\ngo.tools/go/types.Config.Packages map each time but instead keeps re-using it, that map\nwill be populated automatically with all packages imported. This should cut down on the\nnumber of full imports dramatically (each package will be imported exactly once).\n\nThis seems like a good project for somebody who wants to get her/his feet vet (so to\nspeak)...\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **performance**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **HelpWanted**._",
