So does importing k as something other than \".\" in b.go.\n\nProblem can be reduced to:\nimport package k in a.go\naccess a non-existing identifier of k from a.go\nimport package k as . in b.go\n\nThere's nothing special about k here; it could be any package (fmt, io, ...).\n\nWill investigate further.\n\nEoghan\u003c/pre\u003e",
