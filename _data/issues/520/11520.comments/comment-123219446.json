I could write code directly for the logical things, but it becomes problematic when you want to change that format. So I think using a format for physical things would make more sense and more flexible. But I do like the compactness of current trace format.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I tried to create a protocol for it\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/15Bs1kfnbfMWX9IwWQYEteKuoNQrj3NcEm1K989VKeUM/view#. Hopefully I'm not over-reaching with the goals. \r\n\r\nRegarding canvas vs html. The only way I can see slice/arrow rendering working is with canvas. When we get 100,000 events coming in second I would have to create DOM elements, browser simply cannot keep up with it, easily at least. The canvas approach will be simpler and faster. Consequences for using canvas is that you cannot copy-paste content from it, you have to write mouse and keyboard handling yourself, it's harder to change the styling, and it is poor in accessibility (but this program isn't ideal for that to begin with). Obviously, most of the stats and information panels can be kept in html, since they don't change that much. Trace-Viewer uses canvas to draw the box content and overlays the other information with html elements, so there's also a precedent for using that approach.",
