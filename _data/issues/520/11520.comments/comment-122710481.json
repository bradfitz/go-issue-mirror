Then we can improve input format, make  it consume less memory, improve visual appearance, improve navigation (e.g. go to a goroutine trace from full trace), fix remaining bugs (e.g. some elements don't display stack traces), etc.\r\nAlso, the impression that I got is that making changes to trace-viewer is a very slow process. And they  silently break interfaces multiple times (e.g. at some point arrows not starting inside of a slice disappeared from UI, and now you say that lean config is broken).\r\n",
