(Perhaps a trace from a live server or just running many benchmarks could end up needing 15GB instead of 1.5GB?) Dropping to Unplanned though. Hopefully we can do something useful for Go 1.6. There could also be third party tools to trim traces before sending them to the viewer, such as @egonelbre started.\r\n",
