For me difficult part is getting the window and input running across all platforms. Using a custom canvas and blitting it as a texture will be faster, because most of the pixel rows in the main display repeat - i.e. we can copy the same row multiple times. I've implemented widget rendering, so I pretty much know what awaits there, in this case there won't be much complication. We can use simple bitmap fonts as they will be clearer anyway when there is a lot of information. But after seeing the exp/shiny announcement I'll wait and see what they do, before starting with the fat client. (Obviously additionally have a working web client)",
