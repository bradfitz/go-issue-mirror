	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe JSON package uses structure tags to allow the user to define names for the JSON\nfields that differ from those in the Go struct.  The protocol buffer uses tags for a\ndifferent purpose.  If one wants to use JSON to marshal a value achieved from a protocol\nbuffer, things go south; one gets badly formed names.\n\nThe protocol buffer code introduced the format \u0026quot;PB(...)\u0026quot; for its tags.  We\ncould extend that convention with JSON, saying (perhaps) that \u0026quot;JSON(XXX)\u0026quot; is\nthe way to define a renaming.\n\nIn any case, JSON should certainly not use a tag that isn't an identifier.  This would\nbe a simple step that avoids the most obvious collision.\u003c/pre\u003e",
