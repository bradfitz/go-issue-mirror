	"body": "The version of ld that ships with Centos 4/5 does not accept the build-id parameter which causes the build process to abort with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# runtime/cgo\r\n/usr/bin/ld: unrecognized option '--build-id=none'\r\n/usr/bin/ld: use the --help option for usage information\r\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt appears this was added by default in the following commit:\r\n\r\ncommit 7fdb0292a5e322c302b5ab685d8ee2623a69608a\r\nAuthor: Ian Lance Taylor \u003ciant@golang.org\u003e\r\nDate:   Thu Aug 7 12:38:39 2014 -0700\r\n\r\n    cmd/go: pass --build-id=none when generating a cgo .o\r\n\r\n    Some systems, like Ubuntu, pass --build-id when linking.  The\r\n    effect is to put a note in the output file.  This is not\r\n    useful when generating an object file with the -r option, as\r\n    it eventually causes multiple build ID notes in the final\r\n    executable, all but one of which are for tiny portions of the\r\n    file and are therefore useless.\r\n\r\n    Disable that by passing an explicit --build-id=none when\r\n    linking with -r on systems that might do this.\r\n\r\n    LGTM=bradfitz\r\n    R=golang-codereviews, bradfitz\r\n    CC=golang-codereviews\r\n    https://golang.org/cl/119460043\r\n\r\n",
