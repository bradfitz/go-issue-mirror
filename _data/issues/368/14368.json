	"body": "The bytes.Equal function found in runtime/asm_ppc64x.s performs poorly.  It compares a single byte at a time which is very inefficient on Power especially when very long buffers are involved.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a change to add some basic byte compare functions that are more efficient for Power that can be reused by other functions in this file (memeq, memeq_varlen, eqstring, cmpstring, Compare, Equal), similar to what is done in some of the asm files for other platforms.\r\n\r\n",
