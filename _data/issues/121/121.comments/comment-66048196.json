How did you \nknow about this $GOARM variable? It might be a good idea to put this somewhere in the \ninstallation documentation on golang.org, along with the src/all-arm.bash script (is \nthat even necessary? what is the difference with all.bash?), if that information is \nnot there yet. If it is, my apologies for not finding it :/\n\nEven using the fmt package works fine, by the way.\n\nThanks again!\n\nGreetings,\n\nHraban Luyat\u003c/pre\u003e",
