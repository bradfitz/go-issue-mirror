	"body": "The documentation of `Reader.Peek` gives the impression that it'll return the available data on errors, and in most cases it does. But when returning `ErrBufferFull`, which is a clear indication that there is data to return, it may actually return data or not depending on which path returns the error. It should consistently return the available data instead.",
