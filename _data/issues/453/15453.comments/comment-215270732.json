	"body": "Elaborating a bit more, the problem is that sinit.go uses the OLITERAL Node's line number when desugaring OSTRUCTLIT Nodes into sequences of OAS Nodes. Two possible fixes I have in mind:\r\n\r\n1. Change inl.go to clone OLITERAL Nodes. This is simple and I've already experimentally confirmed it works, but I'm worried it will increases memory usage due to having to clone every constant value within inlined function bodies.\r\n\r\n2. Change sinit.go to use a different source for the OAS Nodes' line numbers. Maybe the enclosing OKEY Nodes? Skimming go/printer's source, I think canonical gofmt'ing should always place OKEYs on the same line as the values anyway, though someone might manually write something like:\r\n\r\n        p := \u0026s{\r\n            x:\r\n                1,\r\n        }\r\n\r\n  and the generated `p.x = 1` assignment statement's line association would move from `1,` to `x:`.\r\n\r\nOption 2 seems preferable since it shouldn't negatively impact gofmt'd code, and it still does something reasonable for non-gofmt'd code.",
