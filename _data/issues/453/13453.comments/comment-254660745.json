It also deals with connection rate limiting.\r\n\r\nI use it that way too. The most common use-case here is @github itself.\r\n\r\nThe common workaround to fix this problem is to kill the master process controlling the socket. Unless I am seeing a completely different problem here.\r\n\r\nSince the workaround is so simple and can even be automated for builders, I would rather like to have a go get which is not disabling my carefully chosen non-default ssh options.",
