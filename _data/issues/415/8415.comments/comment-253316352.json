It doesn't seem very elegant to me to change the documentation to state that the client can send nil pointers on basic types but not on types that implement the Valuer interface?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the code you wrote for the proposed fix brings the behavior inline with what is currently documented.\r\n",
