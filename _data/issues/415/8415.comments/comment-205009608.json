	"body": "Yes, I think @rsc missed something here.  The database/sql/driver package already relies on the reflect pkacage.  If the value implements `Valuer`, we need to check whether it is a pointer, whether it is nil, and whether the `Value` method is implemented on a value rather than on a pointer.  This all seems doable.  Maybe something like\r\n\r\n    if rv.Kind() == reflect.Ptr \u0026\u0026 rv.IsNil \u0026\u0026 rv.Type().Elem().Implements(reflect.TypeOf(Valuer)) {\r\n        return nil, nil\r\n    }\r\n\r\nReopening in case somebody wants to implement this, with a test.",
