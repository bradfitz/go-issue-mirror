I'm pretty sure that\nPtrTo is where the problem lies.\n\nWhen you uncomment your lines, the compiler generates the type tables, and the reflect\npackage uses them.  When the lines are commented out, the compiler does not generate the\ntype tables (because the compiler never sees anything take the address of a value of\nthat type) and the reflect package creates the type tables.  So, I'm pretty sure that\nthe problem is in the reflect package, and the compiler is fine.\u003c/pre\u003e",
