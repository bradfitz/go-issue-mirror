	"body": "https://go-review.googlesource.com/11561 introduced gcResetMarkState. This is needed in the same places gcResetGState is needed, but merging them requires shuffling some code around, so it was avoided for the freeze. We should merge these and, more generally, think harder about global state management in the GC, since there are an awful lot of \"reset X state\" functions.\r\n\r\n@RLH",
