The godoc VFS is just an interface, it's\nnot an implementation. We don't try to be nice to an io.Reader or an io.Writer. It's the\ninterface implementation's job to protect itself if it's not ideal.\n\n2) That the index rate limiting is about being nice to the filesystem. It was about\nbeing nice to the CPU, before Go's runtime was as good as it is today, and when it ran\non Robert's desktop machine for all of corp.  Nowadays with goroutine preemption and\nsuch, we could and should probably just remove that support.\n\nI'm inclined to see this closed as WontFix, and move the actual fix to the filesystem\ntype needing protection. The general \"gatefs\" package can provide that protection, if\nyou wrap your filesystem in that.\u003c/pre\u003e",
