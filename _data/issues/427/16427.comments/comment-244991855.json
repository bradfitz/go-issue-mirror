	"body": "Hi! Thank you for maintaining go and making goimports fast. I really like it :heartbeat: \r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I created https://github.com/haya14busa/gopkgs\r\nwhich just list all packages by using the same implementation as goimports.\r\n\r\nIn my environment (`$GOPATH/src` has 725045 files), `go list ...` takes about 10 seconds to list packages, but\r\n`gopkgs` command with .goimportsignore takes under 1 sec.\r\n\r\n`go list ...` is slow but `gopkgs` is fast enough for daily use and can use it with filtering tool or something (if you are interested in some usages, please see README).\r\nI'm very happy with it.\r\n\r\nI implemented gopkgs by coping and modifing https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/imports to export some interface,\r\nbut it's not clever way.\r\n\r\nSo I'm really +1 for this issue.\r\n\r\nI think it might be great to use the scanning code in `go list` as well if possible  and\r\nit's also great to provide the code as a public library.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",
