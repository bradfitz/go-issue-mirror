	"body": "I think that's a bug in your program.  You need to subtract 1 from the pc to get the line of the call itself (see the godoc for runtime.Callers).  The file and line returned by runtime.Caller are correct.\r\n\r\nYou happen to be getting lucky because with the old compiler, the line after the call happens to get the same line # as the call itself.\r\n```\r\n\t0x002b 00043 (issue15427.go:66)\tCALL\t\"\".New(SB)\r\n\t0x0030 00048 (issue15427.go:66)\tMOVQ\t16(SP), BX\r\n```\r\nWith the SSA compiler, the following instruction is from a different line:\r\n```\r\n\t0x0027 00039 (issue15427.go:66)\tCALL\t\"\".New(SB)\r\n\t0x002c 00044 (issue15427.go:7)\tMOVQ\tos.Stdout(SB), AX\r\n```\r\nWhy that's line 7 is strange, but we should probably consider that a different bug.",
