For example, Typing `„ÅÇ` in cp932 (0x82 0xA0) and Enter (0x13, 0x10), This readFile return 0x82, 0x13, 0x10. Now I concluded that we can't fix this issue with current way to implement. However, I don't like to allocate memory to store utf-8 bytes which have same number of characters in DBCS. I want to ask you which way is best.\r\n\r\n* Allocate x3 bytes for utf-8, and call readFile(), convert with MultiByteToWideChar(cp)/WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8).\r\n* Revert implementation of readFile and use ReadConsole. Then handle CTRL-Z especially.\r\n\r\nPlease give me your opinion.\r\n",
