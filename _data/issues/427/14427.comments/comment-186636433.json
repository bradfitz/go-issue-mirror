	"body": "This behaviour comes from the reflect package used in fmt to print the map. \r\nFor a NaN float as reflect value, as key to MapIndex the returned value is:\r\ninvalid reflect.Value\r\n\r\nhttps://play.golang.org/p/oY7vr1WgKk\r\n\r\nreflect MapIndex has the comment:\r\n// It returns the zero Value if key is not found in the map or if v represents a nil map.\r\nSo its seems returning Value{} here would be correct for reflect and fmt needs to use a different way for iterating through the key , value pairs of the map (if those should reflect the stored values in the map) since the key math.Nan() will never compare equal to itself and therefore the value associated with that key will never be found in the map either by reflect or m[].\r\n\r\nBtw. i dont think 0, false for m[math.NaN()] is consistent with map[0.1:5 NaN:0 NaN:0] as the earlier means the key was not found and therefore the 0 return value has no relation with the contents of the map.",
