They should use \"standard\nWindows\" path conventions for GOROOT - \"c:\\go\". For those of us who need to use mingw,\nwe would have to pick correct GOROOT form as required.\n\nIn my view, there is no point persue this issue any further. I am closing it.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
