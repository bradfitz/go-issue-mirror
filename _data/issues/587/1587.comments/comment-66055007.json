I think you have\nGOROOT='c:\\gowin-env', but it needs to be either GOROOT='c:\\\\gowin-env' (remember how\nbash treats '\\') or GOROOT='/c/gowin-env'.\n\nI was surprised to discover, that I use 2 different GOROOT settings myself:\n\n1) GOROOT=c:\\gowin-env when I use Windows prompt;\n2) GOROOT=/c/gowin-env when I use mingw prompt.\n\nNot sure it is right thing to do. Perhaps there is something here that needs to be done.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-windows**._\n\n_Owner changed to @alexbrainman._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
