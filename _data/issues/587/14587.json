	"body": "right now we generate this code for a write barrier test:\r\n\r\n\tMOVL\truntime.writeBarrier(SB), AX\r\n\tTESTB\tAL, AL\r\n\tJNE\t...\r\n\r\nWe should really do:\r\n\r\n\tCMPB\t$1, runtime.writeBarrier(SB)\r\n\tJEQ\t...\r\n\r\nOne less instruction, no register required.\r\nIt's not easy to do now because flagalloc doesn't like operations that take a memory input and generate a flag output (because it wants to be able to move the flag-generation instructions around).\r\n\r\nFigure out a way to fix this.  Maybe introduce a new block type BlockWBCheck that takes a memory control value and has 2 successors.  It has the CMPx implicit inside it.  It would need to be marked as clobbering flags.\r\n\r\n@drchase",
