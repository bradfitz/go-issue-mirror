The reason is that we don't a very long list of mostly short entries be dominated by the formatting of a single long entry (which may be on the \"next page\" on the screen). This is an admittedly simple heuristic, and probably could be improved, but it works mostly ok.\r\n\r\nSomething to work on for version 2 of gofmt.\r\n",
