I suspect the test might not always work for a security reason, so\nperhaps we need to backout sometimes. I tried this test here on all my systems and on\nour builders, and it worked everywhere. But I suspect that everywhere I looked, logged\nin user is memeber if \"Administrators\" group. Are you?\n\nRegardless, I would like to keep running it on our builders. They are logged in as\n\"Administrator\". So, perhaps, we can check for that.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
