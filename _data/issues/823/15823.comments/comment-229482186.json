	"body": "There are problems with two elf tables in output sections related to this change.  The method offset tables are generated with absolute offsets determined at compile time, assuming that all text will appear consecutively.  But if there are multiple text sections, the second one will not appear right after the first, there will be tables inserted by the linker to handle the long call offset instructions.  I believe the method table could be set up with offsets that are relocated so that the values are correct (although not sure what the relocation would be.)\r\n\r\nThe second problem is with the pclntab.  It contains \"entries\" for the functions in the program.  The entries in the table are relocated addresses but the buckets that are generated to look up those entries were created based on absolute function addresses.  As in the first problem, it assumed that all the text is consecutive so that means the buckets used for looking up functions in text sections after the first are not correct.  I think the problem is somewhat easier to solve because worst case it could just do some searching if the lookup PC didn't provide the right function address the first time.",
