	"body": "@minux I've been looking at this to try and understand how the go.o file gets generated.  I'm not sure how best to decide when to generate different .o files.  Should each new package just create a new goX.o file?  Naming them go1.o, go2.o, etc.?  Or are there reasons to divide them up differently.\r\n\r\nA comment about the internal linker.  Personally, I don't think a golang only app will get that big.  All the real world Go applications that I know of link against external libraries or packages of some kind so will require external linking.\r\n\r\nAlso a question about what gets generated.  I've been looking at what gets put into the go.o file today.  I see a lot of functions in the objdump of go.o with names like \u003ctype..eq .something\u003e or \u003ctype..init something\u003e.  What are those for?",
