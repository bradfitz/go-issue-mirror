I just redid the full Kubernetes build (which builds 25 binaries, with 3 that exceed the text size limit) and it took 48 minutes for all of them.\r\n\r\nEither there's something odd in my testcase or it's because my test is a single huge .go source file.  With the Kub binaries they build from multiple .go files and include large packages (.a files) that were compiled in an earlier separate step.\r\n\r\nI like Brad's idea of having the test out there but skipping it by default.",
