	"body": " @crawshaw suggested I add a testcase for this scenario.  It have a prototype that generates the test, which took a long time, and then it took over 45 minutes to compile and link it.  It needs to be cleaned up a bit before adding to the CL but wanted to know if this is too long to use for a testcase.  This would test that the linker tables were created and inserted correctly but wouldn't stress the number of sections since only a few are generated.\r\n@ianlancetaylor suggested an option to specify the max text section size and I've been working on implementing this.  In the real world case using the actual max text section size for ppc64le, a limit of about 128 text sections should be able to handle a big enough program that anyone would care to create.  If a small value is allowed on the argument there could be many 1000s of text sections.  I'm planning to set up a reasonable minimum on the argument and maximum on the number of text sections since I don't think there is a good reason to accept extreme values for either.  The shdrs and phdrs are now static arrays but would be changed to slices of variable size.  This would be good to test out a larger number of sections even though no linker tables might be inserted.  If there are any comments on this approach let me know.",
