	"body": "Thank you for the detailed replies and for the tip on `go build -x`\r\n\r\nI understand that changing the behavior of `ioutil.TempDir` would be a bit unwieldy. I appreciate that usage of `ioutil.TempDir` in user code when TMPDIR has gone away for some reason can be left for the user to manage.\r\n\r\nMy main concern is that a missing TMPDIR can cause `go build` to fail before any user code is interpreted. For example, `go build -h` fails with the same `mkdir` error:\r\n```\r\n\u003e docker run --rm -it golang:1.5.1 /bin/bash -c \"uname -a \u0026\u0026 go version \u0026\u0026 TMPDIR=/foo go build -h\"\r\nLinux 0e893747f98c 4.0.9-boot2docker #1 SMP Thu Sep 10 20:39:20 UTC 2015 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\ngo version go1.5.1 linux/amd64\r\nmkdir /foo/go-build666391459: no such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf providing a better error message after `go build` runs when TMPDIR doesn't exist cannot be fixed without changing the internal behavior of `ioutil.TempDir`, then I accept this as being unfortunate.\r\n",
