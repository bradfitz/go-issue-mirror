And I think that's a\r\nreasonable choice (because $TMPDIR is supposed to always exist and\r\nshould be created by root due to the special sticky bit requirement.)\r\n\r\nAnd I don't think ioutil.TempDir should check for the case where $TMPDIR\r\ndoesn't exist and generate a new error message. The existing message is\r\narguably good enough already: \"mkdir /xxx/yyy: no such file or directory\"\r\nmeans mkdir syscall returns ENOENT, and that signifies that the parent\r\ndirectory doesn't exist or there is a bad symlink somewhere.",
