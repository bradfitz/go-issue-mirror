It could be removed, created, mounted, unmounted, etc. From the Go context, without intercepting every file operation and checking whether the user is trying to access a TMPDIR directory or file, it is impossible to generate better error messages.\r\n\r\nShould we intercept each file op such as os.Open to provide better error messages if the specific file or directory is in the temp directory? It doesn't sound like the expected behavior to me given the fact users can log TMPDIR related error messages with more context in their programs.",
