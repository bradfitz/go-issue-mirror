See golang/go#13624\r\n\r\n\u003e What did you expect to see?\r\n\u003e Unsure.\r\n\r\n:-)\r\n\r\nI believe the bug you're looking for is #14952 (\"net/http: add switches to accept/send bogus HTTP\"), so you could in theory opt-in to accepting garbage in your server.\r\n\r\nBut there's zero chance of that being backported to a Go 1.6.x version, and I'm undecided on #14952 anyway, plus time is running out for Go 1.7.\r\n\r\nSo, I think your best bet might be a unix domain socket proxy which replaces `Host: /var/run/docker.sock\\r\\n` to `Host: \\r\\n` or something. (Maybe it's a bit trickier; I'm not sure whether you use the unix socket in trickier ways, though, using it for auth or sending file descriptors or something.)\r\n\r\n",
