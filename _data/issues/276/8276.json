Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat does 'go version' print?\n\ngo version go1.3 linux/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/PVBGNsPLN1\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/PVBGNsPLN1\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat happened?\n\nreturned error is nil when dial a non-exists address.\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nthe error should not be nil.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nIt happens only on Go 1.3, Go 1.2 doesn't have this issue, so I compared the source\ncode, and found out that this was caused by a change to \u0026quot;connect\u0026quot; method in\n\u0026quot;net/fd_unix.go\u0026quot; file. So I edited this method with the old version, then\nrecompiled Go 1.3, the issue disappeared.\u003c/pre\u003e",
