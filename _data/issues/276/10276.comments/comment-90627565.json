However, the circumstances are strange here, since we're working from within GOROOT.\r\n\r\nThanks, I'll look into it.\r\n\r\n\u003e As a consumer of these packages, I can say that the `go/loader` API would benefit from simplification and/or more examples.\r\n\r\nI agree.  The API has a lot of moving parts and not enough documentation, and the implementation is more complex than it looks.\r\n\r\nI'm tempted to just remove support for loading binary export data entirely, since supporting it well will require the addition of a lot more complexity: the addition of staleness-checking logic as described above, and the fixing of a subtle bug about loading a mixture of source and binary.\r\n\r\n\r\n[I seem to have misunderstood the Github UI here and edited Josh's comment while trying to respond to it.
