Please let me know if you see this again.\r\n\r\ngo/loader no longer supports loading from binary, which simplifies the API slightly and the internals rather more.\r\n\r\nI've moved the API documentation into doc.go, and added a number of Example tests showing basic usage of the API.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you find further problems with this package, or have ideas for improving it.",
