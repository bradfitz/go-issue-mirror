(I hope that if go/loader always\nuse gc, gccgo and then source importer, authors of other toolchains will\ntry to stick to one of the available export file formats.)\n\nI think many of the frustration for tools like stringer comes from the fact\nthat they can't import from source where source is available (whenever\nI see a report against x/tools/cmd/* that package can't be imported, I will\nreply the same: have you tried \"go install\" first? And 100% of time, that\nsolved the problem.)\n\nWe should do something here.\n",
