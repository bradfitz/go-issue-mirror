Notice that in my original code I was actually doing the equivalent of \nfunc BuggyNewMyType(a int) (v *myType){\n\tv:= new(NewMyType);\n        v.a = a;\n\treturn v;\n\n}\n\nand the compiler correctly told me that v was already declared, so I just 'blindly'\nremoved it and here we are :)\n\nWhile I agree that it is not a bug per se, a runtime crash (without any warning from\nthe compiler) seems a bit surprising, don't you think?\u003c/pre\u003e",
