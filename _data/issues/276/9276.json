	"body": "(net/http).Request is populated vastly differently on the client and server sides.\r\nThat's probably not fixable, given Go1 compatibility.\r\n\r\nBut it causes problems when testing http handlers - httptest.ResponseRecorder needs a Request to go with it, and the obvious candidate (http.NewRequest) generates the client-side version, not the server-side version.\r\n\r\nYou can get the server-side version by setting up an httptest.Server and making a request to it, but that involves a lot of boilerplate and some syscalls.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there were a way (in the http or httptest package) to get a Request in the server-side format without having to go through the whole HTTP stack with a real server.\r\n\r\n",
