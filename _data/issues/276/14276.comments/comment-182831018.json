I double checked the zoneinfo.zip that i was using and it turned out, that the copy was incomplete, only 105kB vs some 352kB.\r\n\r\nWhen I copied it again and pointed ZONEINFO to it, it works.\r\n\r\nThe error message was not completely clear to me, would have expected something along the line \"found zoneinfo.zip, but I cannot read it\".\r\n\r\nIt is safe to close this as user error. :)",
