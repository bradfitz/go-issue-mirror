The zombie program, however, is 8.out which\nI think is in 8l. So I think it may be unrelated to the weird linking in 8g. (I'm a\nnovice..) Interesting to note is that when the program was killed in activity monitor\nthe virtual memory was listed as 6 million terabytes; is there is difference in\npaging between tiger and leopard? anyway, again, it seems it'd be unrelated to the\nlinking problem above, and one of the \"unexpected 10.4 behaviors\" of go in general.\n\nBut I'm a novice, so I'd appreciate some criticism..\u003c/pre\u003e",
