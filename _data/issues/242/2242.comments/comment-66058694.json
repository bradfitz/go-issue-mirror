The current behavior renders gofmt useless for\npeople who are sharing code with people on different development environments.  Given a\nwell-formatted go source file from a different OS, gofmt will (a) _incorrectly_ report\nthat the file needs to be reformatted (-l), and (b) unnecessarily change the entire file.\u003c/pre\u003e",
