However, the ELF specs that I've been looking at specify that the PHDR\nsection entry in the section header table should appear /before/ any sections marked\nloadable.\n\nI'm fairly sure there's more constraints on the PHDR section that I haven't found yet,\nbut that's the braindump of my current attempts to make paxctl work with Go programs, if\nanyone can beat me to a patch that makes that fatal error go away.\u003c/pre\u003e",
