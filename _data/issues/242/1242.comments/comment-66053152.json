It prints out zero sized sections too, but\nfeel free ignore those.\n\nOn tutorial hello world, with 6g pulled in 2011-03-16, the results are as follows (prior\nto even running strip):\n./parse-sections.py 6.out \n         SectName  VMAddress  Size(B) Errors\n          .interp 0x00400be4       28 \n            .text 0x00400c00   237618 \n        .rela.plt 0x0043b000        0 ZERO SIZED SECTION\n            .rela 0x0043b000        0 OVERLAPS WITH PREVIOUS, ZERO SIZED SECTION\n          .dynstr 0x0043b000        4 OVERLAPS WITH PREVIOUS\n          .rodata 0x0043b000   788232 OVERLAPS WITH PREVIOUS\n             .plt 0x0043b004       16 OVERLAPS WITH PREVIOUS\n            .hash 0x0043b014       20 \n          .dynsym 0x0043b028       24 \n         .dynamic 0x0043b040      224 \n        .shstrtab 0x0043b120      340 \n       .gopclntab 0x0048f9a8    21080 \n        .gosymtab 0x00494c00   420616 \n             .got 0x004fc000        0 ZERO SIZED SECTION\n            .data 0x004fc000     8160 OVERLAPS WITH PREVIOUS\n         .got.plt 0x004fc118       24 OVERLAPS WITH PREVIOUS\n             .bss 0x004fdfe0 33647768\n\nSome of the overlaps are quite serious in range. These will certainly trigger the\nwarnings of libbfd (that strip uses).\n\nThe silly little python script I wrote can be found at\n\u003ca href=\"http://iohazard.net/pub/go/parse-sections.py\"\u003ehttp://iohazard.net/pub/go/parse-sections.py\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/pre\u003e",
