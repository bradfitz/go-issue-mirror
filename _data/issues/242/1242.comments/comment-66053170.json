The bug I reported was slightly different at the time: Go binaries crash on\nhardened kernels that enforce W^X memory pages, because the runtime needs W+X. Normally,\nyou can disable that enforcement per-binary with tools that tag the ELF with flags, but\nthose tools crash because of ELF malformations.\n\nAnyway, you're correct that it's a separate, but related bug. I'll open a new issue and\nassign it to myself for further poking.\u003c/pre\u003e",
