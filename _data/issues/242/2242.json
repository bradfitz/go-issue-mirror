	"body": "by **seanerussell**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBug, or feature request?  I'm not sure.\n\nUp to weekly.2011-06-23 8876 (b42014761d96), both gofix and gofmt mangle line endings. \nI argue that this is undesirable behavior, since it interferes with developers working\non different platforms.\n\nTo reproduce: create a Go source file on Linux, and run gofmt on it.  Take the resulting\nfile to a Windows machine, and run the exact same version of gofmt on it on Windows.\n\nWhen run on Windows, gofmt will report that every file needs to be fixed (which is\nincorrect), and if told to write the changes, will change the line endings of every line\nin the file; consequently, version control systems will think every line has changed.\n\ngofmt should be idempotent when the same version of gofmt is run on the same file on\ndifferent platforms.  In other words, gofmt should leave line endings alone.  It's\nacceptable for gofmt to choose an EOL style when it has to insert or break lines.\nIdeally, gofmt should grab the line ending of the first line in the file and use that\nwhen it has to insert line endings, but otherwise leave line endings alone.\n\ngofix does the same thing, changing the line endings on lines which it otherwise doesn't\ntouch.  This is slightly less onerous than gofmt's behavior, because gofmt is more of a\ndesirable candidate to be added as a pre-commit hook, or part of the build chain (for\nexample).\u003c/pre\u003e",
