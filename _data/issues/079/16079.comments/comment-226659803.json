If you are sending 500,000 requests with a concurrency of 10,000 goroutines, you're very quickly going to run out of ephemeral ports on the client. http.Client objects are safe for use across multiple goroutines, so you should try sharing a single one. (Or, possibly one per goroutine; I don't know if you can issue 10,000 requests simultaneously from a single Client, or if there would be blocking.)",
