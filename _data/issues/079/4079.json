It might even help just to\nchange it to:\n\ncannot find package on $GOROOT or $GOPATH\n\ncannot find package on $GOROOT(=\u0026quot;...\u0026quot;) or $GOPATH(=\u0026quot;...\u0026quot;)\n\nI'm sure more could be done. The point is we know much about why it failed that we don't\ntell the user.\u003c/pre\u003e",
