	"body": "by **davidben@chromium.org**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThis is a minor feature request. It would be nice if http.Handler exposed the underlying\nnet.Conn for consumers to query state from. It does expose the tls.ConnectionState, but\nif you're using a custom net.Listener implementation, there doesn't seem to be a way to\ncorrelate calls to the Handler with the net.Conn the net.Listener returned.\n\nMy particular use case is pointing the standard HTTP server at a fork of crypto/tls to\nwrite demo servers for testing how clients respond to this or that broken server\nbehavior, where the HTTP server prints out TLS connection state. Since it's a fork of\ncrypto/tls with quirks patched in, http.Request.TLS isn't filled in. Writing a dummy\nHTTP/1.0 server is easy enough, and there's also http.Hijacker, but it'd be nice to be\nable to use the existing HTTP server implementation without having to either reimplement\nthe HTTP stack or hijack the socket and lose the standard socket reuse, etc., behavior.\u003c/pre\u003e",
