	"body": "@bradfitz I suspect this could have something to do with the specific version of OpenSSL running on Heroku's rendezvous component. I no longer work there, but maybe @fabiokung, @dpiddy, or @freeformz would be able to debug further.\r\n\r\nThe heroku-go package is just [using http.Client](https://github.com/bgentry/heroku-go/blob/master/heroku.go) under the hood to make an API call that spawns a \"dyno\" (container) on Heroku. That part is really irrelevant, except that it returns a URL that needs to be used in the connection to rendezvous.\r\n\r\nYou can see a complete example of [how this is done in the hk client](https://github.com/heroku/hk/blob/master/run.go), which uses heroku-go. So anybody with a Heroku account should be able to reproduce this issue using `hk run -a myappname bash` on Windows (which I haven't tried).\r\n\r\nSeparately, @leo-stone you are going to want to rotate your API key as the one you included in your repo is now compromised, and anybody can use it to modify your Heroku apps and/or rack up charges on your account.",
