It would let the Handler do Read and Write,\nbut the handler may used via the SPDY or HTTP/2 protocol, and then letting Handlers try\nto assume they're in HTTP/1.1 and read or write stuff to the socket would be buggy.\n\nYou can fork net/http if you need to do weird things, or you can propose a much more\nfine-grained mechanism.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
