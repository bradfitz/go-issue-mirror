The only reason this works in say C is because there are no booleans in C; instead they are mapped to integers. ^ is an integer operation.\r\n\r\n!= is already doing exactly what the ^ operation via the detour of booleans mapped to C achieves. In fact, ^ may not do the right thing if the mapping of bool -\u003e int is not 100% consistent. That is != is clearer and cleaner. No need for another operator.\r\n",
