Hence, if a GC happens part way through `allocInterleaved`, but then doesn't happen after we start calling `main.alloc`, we'll see the buckets but they won't contain any counts.\r\n\r\nI can reliably reproduce the failure on Linux with `GOGC=10000 go run heapsampling.go`.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution is to call `runtime.GC()` at the top of the test's `getMemProfileRecords`. I've sent https://go-review.googlesource.com/16846 with this fix.",
