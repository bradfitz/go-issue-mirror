Compile the following program:\npackage main\nfunc f(s1 uint, s2 uint) bool {\n  return ((1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 32) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; s1) \u0026gt; ((1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 32) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; s2)\n}\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nIt's not clear from the spec what the expected output should be.  The type\nof (1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;32) should be whatever type is forced on it by its owning\nexpression, but the owning expression is a comparison operator, so there is\nno type.  8g appears to pick int, which is perhaps a reasonable choice, but\nthe spec should probably clarify.\u003c/pre\u003e",
