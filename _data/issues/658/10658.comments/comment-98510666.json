What do you do instead?\r\n\r\nIf this were added, it would be a pre-commit hook, so if you use the hooks, it'd be picked up.\r\n\r\nI agree that we should enforce some simple size rules on the gerrit side, but doing it here too lets us put in more subtle and more restrictive detection logic, which the user can intentionally overrule. I like @nightlyone's suggestion for that. Overruling a gerrit check is way beyond a reviewer sanity-check.\r\n",
