It would be nice if one could\npass a bufio.Reader to NewDecoder, and be able to share the bufio buffering between\ncalls to Decode, and other protocol logic.\n\nI don't expect this to change quickly. But perhaps it could use bufio right, without\nbreaking the Decoder.Buffered guarantee for Go1?\n\nAt least, once you do break Go1 promises, please change this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
