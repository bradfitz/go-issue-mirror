	"body": "On closer inspection of the failures you posted (thanks for collecting several, BTW), this smells like memory corruption. Just guessing, there are a few likely culprits. It may be the finalizer code, but I actually think that's less likely. More likely is that it's the fork/exec code: that code is really subtle, mucks with the address space, and contains system-specific parts (which would explain why it's showing up on FreeBSD, but I haven't been able to reproduce it on Linux yet).\r\n\r\n@derekmarcotte, can you try commenting out the runtime.SetFinalizer call in newProcess in os/exec.go (your test doesn't need that finalizer) and see if you can still reproduce it? If you can, that will rule out finalizers.",
