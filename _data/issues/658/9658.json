	"body": "Steps to reproduce.\r\n\r\n1. Change a file.\r\n2. git checkout -b test-branch\r\n3. git commit -av -m \"DO NOT REVIEW test in progress\"\r\n4. git codereview mail\r\n\r\nSee http://golang.org/cl/3174/ for an example.\r\n\r\nI'm not doing `git codereview change` anywhere in there and maybe I should be. My lack of reading the directions aside, the tool should tell me if I'm doing the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nIf skipping the `git codereview change` is expected to work, I think there must be a bug in the auto-create change code path that is slurping the diff into the description.",
