It just says that it must be an integer value, and that values outside the range result in the value \"\\uFFFD\".\r\n\r\ngo/types accepts this without errors.\r\n\r\nI don't think it matters much, but it seems easier to simply produce this constant string (at compile time) than reporting an error.",
