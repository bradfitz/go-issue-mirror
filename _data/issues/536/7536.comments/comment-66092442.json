So encoding/json can't see\nthat *DecimalE8 implements MarshalJSON because it only has a DecimalE8 value.\n\nIt is important to preserve this property, because a value implemented on *T might\nassume that it can modify the underlying T value (which, given a value receiver, it\ncould not).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
