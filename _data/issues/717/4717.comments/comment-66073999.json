However, when it's installing\nthe files \u0026 package scripts, all I see are single lines of \"#\" or \"...\" with no paths of\nfiles being installed indicated (referring to a similar output from `unrar x` or `unzip`)\n\nHaving no diagnostic messages whatsoever to go on is making debugging sufficiently\ndifficult that I've to call for help here by submitting a new issue, otherwise I'd have\ntried solving it myself (can't show package contents of the .pkg either)\u003c/pre\u003e",
