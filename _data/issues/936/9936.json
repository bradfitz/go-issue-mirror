	"body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nGo is very awesome, but I think Go's official websites should have a better design. It's really not eyes-friendly / eyes-catching for looking up tutorials, docs, API references. They should have a better syntax highlight themes. For someone who is not a hardcore programmer or native English speaker like me, it's really terrible to scan/skim/read the contents on Go's websites. The poor design of official websites makes Golang looks like an old programming language (this is the feeling not logic).\r\n\r\nBelow is random websites which are eyes-friendly / eyes-catching than Go's:\r\nhttp://developer.android.com/\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/swift/\r\nhttps://www.python.org/\r\nhttp://symfony.com/\r\nhttps://www.djangoproject.com/\r\nhttp://laravel.com/\r\nhttp://fatfreeframework.com/home\r\nhttp://hacklang.org/\r\nhttp://hhvm.com/\r\nhttp://php.net/\r\n\r\nForgive me if your eyes have no problems while looking up for docs, API refs on Golang's websites :)",
