	"body": "Hello. Recently [Goclipse](https://github.com/GoClipse/goclipse) has added integration with the Go Oracle tool within Eclipse, for a Open Definition functionality. There's a few things Go Oracle could improve upon, to further improve the integration.\r\n\r\n* Namely, could the \"describe\" operation be modified to include a field with the documentation of the underlying element (if the element is a definition)?\r\n\r\nThat would be very useful: it would allow documentation popups in the editor (similar to what is being done here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bruno-medeiros/DDT/master/documentation/screenshots/sample_ddocView.png). It could even be used to complement tools such as https://github.com/nsf/gocode, to provide documentation info during during Content Assist: http://i.imgur.com/IQnyP2l.png\r\n\r\n",
