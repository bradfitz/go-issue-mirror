You need to require the \"network-bind\" interface (as opposed to the \"network\" interface) in order to be able to use the bind system call (see http://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces)\r\n\r\nThis init-time probe means that all Go programs that import /net, even if they're only importing it for IP address parsing, will require the \"network-bind\" interface.\r\n\r\nIt would be more appropriate to do this probe with sync.Once only when actual access to the network stack is required. Would that result in significant performance loss?",
