	"body": "Regalloc currently has a simple loop entry detector.  When detected, it loads live values into registers before entering the loop.  The detector doesn't always work.  In particular, it doesn't work on loops containing other loops.  See #14606 \r\n\r\nWe might want a general mechanism in SSA to identify loops.  Block.loopDepth maybe, or something more sophisticated.\r\n\r\n@dr2chase \r\n\r\n",
