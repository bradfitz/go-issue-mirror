Can you change your logging lines to:\n\n    (echo '\u003e\u003e\u003e'; go env GOROOT; echo '\u003c\u003c\u003c') \u003e\u003edidier\n    (echo '\u003e\u003e\u003eTTT'; go env GOROOT; echo '\u003c\u003c\u003c') | tee \u003e\u003edidier\n\nand see if you can still reproduce the bad output? I too was wondering if\nsome other process was writing to the pipe incorrectly, perhaps the result\nof a test success. But if bash is doing its job correctly that should not\nbe possible.\n\nRuss\n",
