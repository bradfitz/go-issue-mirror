One might well construct a whitespace-sensitive example that doesn't\nfail as expected; for instance, the following actual outputs are accepted by the\nright-leaning triangle example output:\n\n*\n **\n***\n\n         *\n **\n***\n\nThe testing documentation isn't explicit about the behavior here. What if the output\nparsing were changed? Right now, doc.Examples removes all leading/trailing whitespace;\nwhat if instead it only removed /^[ ]*\\n?/   ? I think that's a more intuitive behavior\nthat works for both the single-line (e.g., '// Output: hi') and multi-line output\ntargets.\n\nThe trimming of the actual output would have to be adjusted correspondingly.\n\nI'm happy to make these changes but wanted some feedback first.\u003c/pre\u003e",
