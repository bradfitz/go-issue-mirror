	"body": "Calling `LocalAddr()` on a `net.Conn` representing the client side of a unix socket connection sometimes returns a nil `*net.UnixAddr` wrapped in a non-nil `net.Addr`. The `String` method of the resulting `net.Addr` works because of a nil check in `UnixAddr.String`, but the `Network` method tries to dereference a nil pointer and panics. I haven't yet been able to isolate this but it has been happening with some frequency in our test suite (cockroachdb/cockroach#1563). \r\n\r\nIt looks like there's a case where some uninitialized variable of type `*UnixAddr` is getting passed to a function expecting a `net.Addr` (or some related interface type), but the only occurrence of this pattern that I've been able to track down is the call from `dialUnix` to `unixSocket`, and `unixSocket` has the necessary checks via the `isWildcard` method.",
