Because the arguments are interpreted\ndifferently by different calls.  Sometimes arg is a pointer, while\nother times it is an integer.  So there's no good function signature\nfor the package to expose.\n\nIf you need a particular ioctl or fcntl, you can always use\nsyscall.Syscall.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
