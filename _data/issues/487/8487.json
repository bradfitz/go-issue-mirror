	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eA handful of recent cmd/cgo issues were only intermittent failures because they subtly\ndepended quirks in GCC's DWARF output, which in turn subtly depended upon the order of\nC.xxx references output by cgo (which in turn is random because of a \u0026quot;range\u0026quot;\niteration over the f.Name map in (*Package).guessKinds(*File)).  Making it deterministic\nseems easy enough to do (just add an appropriate call to sort.Sort somewhere in\ncmd/cgo/gcc.go), but it's not obvious to me whether that's desirable or not.\n\nOn one hand, the random ordering seems to have helped fuzz test debug/dwarf and cmd/cgo\na bit and perhaps expose bugs we wouldn't have otherwise been aware of, but it also\nmeans builds might spuriously fail because of latent bugs rather than deterministically\nfail depending on the input.\u003c/pre\u003e",
