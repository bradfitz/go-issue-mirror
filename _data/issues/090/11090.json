	"body": "I am running go 1.4.2 on Linux/amd64 and noticed that I get an error using go get in a situation that doesn't seem to be an error. Here are the commands to reproduce it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir /home/William/go\r\n$ export GOPATH=/home/William/go\r\n$ go get -d golang.org/x/tools \u0026\u0026 echo \"download of source was successful.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the first time I run \"go get -d golang.org/x/tools\", I do not get the successful message. Instead, a failure error code is returned along with the message:\r\n\r\n\" golang.org/x/tools: No buildable Go source files in /home/William/go/src/golang.org/x/tools\"\r\n\r\nIf \"-d\" is download only, is this a bug, or am I misunderstanding what \"-d\" means?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nWilliam\r\n",
