It's not partial, it's the full assembly output for that function.\r\n\r\nThe jumps are all used but they are inefficient compared to the minimal possible output. \r\n\r\nThe TESTL might be residual of removed nil-checks (as the flags set by those tests are not checked afterwards), but if so, they should removed as well.\r\n\r\nThe register spill is in fact used later on at 0x4096cea, but there are a dozen of registers available so there's really no reason for spilling to the stack.  \r\n\r\n",
