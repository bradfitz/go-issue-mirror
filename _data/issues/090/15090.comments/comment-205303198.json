But I could revive that, if people are interested.\r\n\r\nAlgorithm was:\r\n1. detect (reducible) loops\r\n2. determine articulation blocks (those which must execute if loop executes)\r\n3. find fixed point of \"values not relying on within-loop values\"\r\n4. filter out the ones that are too simple to care about\r\n\r\nOnly thing remaining is to move those into the predecessor of the loop header (assuming after critical edges eliminated).  Note that this increases register pressure, so you might want a heuristic on loop size.",
