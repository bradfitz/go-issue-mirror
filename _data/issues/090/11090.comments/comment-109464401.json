	"body": "`go get` is for fetching _packages_, not repositories. `golang.org/x/tools` is the root of the tools repository, so `go get golang.org/x/tools` will succeed in checking out the repository but then fail as it tries to build `tools` package (as there is no such package).\r\n\r\nThis explains why `-d` works, as it only tries to download the package but doesn't try to build.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why `go get -d -u` should be different to `go get -d` in its error state. Maybe that's a bug?",
