This is with top-of-trunk gcc/gccgo; I will make another attempt using the official GCC 6.1.0 bits.\r\n\r\n@tamird, is there anything you can recommend that will speed up the cockroachdb builds? The build process includes a lot of C++ compilations, all of which are being done serially, so I am spending much time waiting for compiles to complete. I tried passing -j20 to make and GOFLAGS=\"-p 20\", but from what I can tell GOFLAGS isn't being passed through to 'glock's, so there is zero parallelism.\r\n",
