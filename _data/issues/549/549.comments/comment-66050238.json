I just want a 120 second timeout on a select \n{} statement.\n\nBut I worked around it by keeping track of when the last message was sent for each \npeer, and periodically checking every peer to see I need to send a keepalive message. So \nnow I have just one Ticker for all 40 peers and the ticker is kept around rather than \nthrown away on each select call.\u003c/pre\u003e",
