It seems to me that if\ncode says 'package main', it should be a command (always) and not importable.\n\nI won't touch this for Go 1.4, but for Go 1.5 I think we should probably just disallow\nimports of package main. If I remember correctly, that was never intended to work.\n\nI'd be happy to hear counterarguments.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.5**, removed **release-none**._",
