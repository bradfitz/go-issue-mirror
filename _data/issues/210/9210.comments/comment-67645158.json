Does the real device use Docker at all or is this how the Emulator runs Android?\r\n\r\nJust to clarify a bit, running the `so` on a Nexus 5 emulator actually works but not on the real Nexus 5 device.\r\n\r\nAlso, something else I observed is that when the process crashes, Android attempts to boot the process two more times (failing the same way) and then gives up.\r\n",
