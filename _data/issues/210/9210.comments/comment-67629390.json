I don't get any error messages, just that text relocation warning which I am not sure if it is totally related. I don't get that warning on my Tablet (running older Android), where the `so` works. It could be just that Lollipop has a new text relocation check, that the older one does, yet the issue to be caused by something else.\r\n\r\nIn fact, what i stumbled upon is this issue:\r\n[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/NB6jPV9gddQ](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/NB6jPV9gddQ)\r\nIt is possible that this is what is actually happening. I am not sure how to do the low level log tracing that they have done there in order to verify that.\r\n\r\nP.S. After my issue was moved to GitHub I never received a notification that there was any activity going on. Sorry for the late reply!\r\n",
