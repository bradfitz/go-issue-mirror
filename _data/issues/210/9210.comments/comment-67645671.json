Android doesn't run Docker, but the Golang recommended method of compiled for Android ([here](http://github.com/golang/mobile)) involves running the compilation inside a Docker container.\r\n\r\nIf you update the version of Go you were using, it _should_ fix the issue with crashing before user code is loaded (and Android attempts to rerun it, yes) as per #9311. However, if you can confirm that _some_ of your Go code is executing before the crash, then that is a different issue, and one that I am trying to figure out now.",
