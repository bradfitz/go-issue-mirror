I am experiencing failures on SmartOS and OpenIndiana using the most recent GCC 5.2 built from source, but even going back to GCC 4.7.3 doesn't resolve the problem. Almost certainly this is caused by some combination of GCC, binutils, linker and combination flags (I noticed the -D_REENTRANT flag normally required for multithreaded apps is not passed to GCC, for instance). Is there documentation available on the Go runtime, stack frame and calling conventions, as well as how they interoperate with C in cgo, including the g TLS variable.g? I can probably run the test program under GDB watching for changes to g, but I am not sure I can interpret what is going on without the lay of the land.",
