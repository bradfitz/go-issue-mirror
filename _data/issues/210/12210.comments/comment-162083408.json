	"body": "Thanks for the extra information. I got access to a Solaris box and was able to reproduce this. It looks like when the stack is \"unlimited\", asking Solaris how big the stack is returns the current stack size (in this case, 0x3000 bytes), not its maximum size. Then Go tries to stay within that size and triggers the call to morestack on a cgo callback because the C code in the middle has taken up all of the original 0x3000 bytes and then some. Will send a CL making Go less gullible.",
