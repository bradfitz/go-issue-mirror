	"body": "@fazalmajid if I had to guess, I'd say the difference might be due to a fix Solaris has for stack_inbounds() being broken for the main thread.\r\n\r\nHistorically, stack_inbounds() just checked for the given address greater-than-or-equal-to the stack base and less than base + curthread-\u003eul_stack.ss_size.\r\n\r\nWe fixed libc_init() so that if the stack is unlimited, it tries reading the stack size from /proc/self/rmap.  If that fails, we just set it to 8 Mbytes.\r\n\r\nThat's a wild guess at the moment, so I think the Go fix that was put in place likely remains right workaround for now.",
