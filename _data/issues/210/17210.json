	"body": "The [filepath.Abs documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Abs) clearly states that \"Abs calls Clean on the result\", but this is not always true.  This was already noticed and mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16111#issuecomment-228955189) on issue #16111, but this one quirk seems to have been missed in the patch.\r\n\r\nI understand that changing this behavior to match the docs would break any code that depends on the existing implementation.  If the implementation cannot be changed, the documentation should at least be updated to match the implementation.\r\n\r\ngo version: go1.7.1 windows/amd64\r\n\r\nRun this code from [this playground](https://play.golang.org/p/mSWVatv4ql) on windows and linux and compare the output\r\n\r\nI expected to see a cleaned result coming out of Abs on windows.  I'm using the trailing slash as the indicator that clean was not called.\r\n\r\nInstead, I see that Clean was not called by Abs on windows.  A quick comparison of the windows and unix implementations of Abs verifies this inconsistency.\r\n\r\n",
