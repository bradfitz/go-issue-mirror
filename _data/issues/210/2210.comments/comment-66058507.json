After some more digging the wording is as such in RFC 1866, that the default\nencoding is url encoded.\n\nI actually found it to be a bug in my http client library explicitly not encoding \";\".\n\n8.2.1. The form-urlencoded Media Type\n\n   The default encoding for all forms is `application/x-www-form-\n   urlencoded'. A form data set is represented in this media type as\n   follows:\n\n8.2.3. Forms with Side-Effects: METHOD=POST\n\n   If the service associated with the processing of a form has side\n   effects (for example, modification of a database or subscription to a\n   service), the method should be `POST'.\n\n   To process a form whose action URL is an HTTP URL and whose method is\n   `POST', the user agent conducts an HTTP POST transaction using the\n   action URI, and a message body of type `application/x-www-form-\n   urlencoded' format as above. The user agent should display the\n   response from the HTTP POST interaction just as it would display the\n   response from an HTTP GET above.\u003c/pre\u003e",
