RFC does not require form data posted in a body to\nbe URL Encoded, as far as I can tell. I'm running into this issue as I have a value with\nan unencoded \";\" in form value of a string.\n\nparseQuery treats the body and the url query as being similar, where one has\nrestrictions that the other doesn't.\n\nI could be wrong.\u003c/pre\u003e",
