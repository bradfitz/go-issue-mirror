Send SIGQUIT to your program (Control-\\) to see the deadlock. The deadlock detector is not guaranteed to tell you about everything. It only works for pretty simple cases. \r\n\r\nUnlike some projects on Github, we don't use the Go issue tracker for Q\u0026A, since we started with a mailing list. I recommend you post this to golang-nuts@ if you have further questions.\r\n",
