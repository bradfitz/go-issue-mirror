	"body": "This whole mechanism is best effort anyway, so I don't think this is a big deal. The logical race (not a data race) window is very small, and subsequent getConn calls will restore any channel that is deleted too early. The network round-trip time is so much larger than the goroutine scheduling time between locking a mutex, doing a map lookup, unlocking a mutex, and doing a receive-or-default-out unbuffered channel read.\r\n\r\nI looked into this, but I think any fix would be more gross and invasive than it would be beneficial.\r\n\r\nI'd rather not fix this, so I'm going to close it. If you have a minimal fix, I'd be open to looking at it, but I'd rather focus my time on HTTP/2 stuff right now.\r\n",
