Now the solution of the\n  last exercise should be doable.\n* The mention on the last exercise might be a bit too indirect.\n  Instead of \"but maps are not safe for concurrent use!\", maybe\n  be \"but maps alone are not safe for concurrent use!\" to strongly\n  suggest that sync.Mutex can secure maps, so they can be used\n  if used properly.\n\nBest,\nBernhard\n",
