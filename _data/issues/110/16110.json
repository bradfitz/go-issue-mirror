	"body": "I would like to report the results of non-standard benchmark (non google/benchmark style) along side existing benchmarks, and do so following the proposed Go benchmark data format. For example, the [pbench package](https://github.com/benburkert/pbench) reports percentiles in addition to the standard results.\r\n\r\nI was unable to implement this benchmark without [using reflection to access some unexported fields](https://github.com/benburkert/pbench/blob/ffdb761593fd7d0910be0d11a8797d9ffaf44cd6/pbench.go#L64-L67), and there was no mechanism for using the same `io.Writer` for the [output](https://github.com/benburkert/pbench/blob/ffdb761593fd7d0910be0d11a8797d9ffaf44cd6/pbench.go#L83). A preferable solution would be a new method on `B` that, provided a name \u0026  benchmark-result argument, formats and writes the results in the standard format.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, adding a `ReportAllocs` field to `BenchmarkResults` would be useful for when a benchmark is run with `-benchmem` but a non-standard benchmark does not support malloc statistics.",
