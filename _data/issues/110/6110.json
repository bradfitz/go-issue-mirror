We found it was about\n40X, which is fifty times better than C++ (as well as being simpler and hence faster to\nprocess), but it's still bigger than we expected. There are two reasons for this. First,\nwe found a bug: the Go compiler was generating a substantial amount of data in the\nexport section that did not need to be there. Second, the export data uses a verbose\nencoding that could be improved. We plan to address these issues.\u0026quot;\n\nWriting this down so it gets addresses. This was written a year ago but nothing has\nhappened.\u003c/pre\u003e",
