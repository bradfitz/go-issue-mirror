However, i execute 'go version' under the cmd.exe as administrator.\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nmy development environment is  the windows7 enterprise. \r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nactually, i had ever built projects written using golang. But i cannot use it after my pc joined into an domain of my company. I tried 'go version' 'go help'... etc, but it cannot returns any words.\r\nI am sure that GOROOT and GOPATH is set.\r\nTherefore, I can only launch the remote Linux(CentOS 7.1) machine and upload my project code to build my project. \r\n",
