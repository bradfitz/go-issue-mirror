	"body": "Package `log` can print out timestamps with the `Ldate`/`Ltime`/`Lmicroseconds` flags, but the time displayed is in local time without a time zone (http://play.golang.org/p/848Wa50X0d). The machines on which I run software don't always agree on the timezone (PST/PDT for laptop, UTC for server), which makes this output sometimes confusing.\r\n\r\nIs there a way for the log lines to be unambiguous? Maybe\r\n- Set the \"Local\" timezone of the entire process to \"UTC\"\r\n- Add a flag to package `log` to force its timezone to \"UTC\"\r\n- Add a flag to package `log` to print the timezone as part of the prefix\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the third option, but I'm open to solutions that don't require changes to the stdlib. Thanks!",
