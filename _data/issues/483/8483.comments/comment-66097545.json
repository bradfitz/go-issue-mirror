The report suggests\nthat just waiting for all pending requests and calling CloseIdleConnections won't do, as\nthere can be new racing connections. Obviously she can't do what you've done in the\ntest, as it uses the unexported function.\nIf this happens periodically, it can lead to serious resource leaks (the transport is\nalso preserved alive).\nAm I missing something?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **New**._",
