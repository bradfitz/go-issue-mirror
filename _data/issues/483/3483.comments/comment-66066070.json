Working with the tools will be better in the long run\nthan working against them.\n\nGo version 1 *is* stable, but it is also not backwards compatible\nwith r60.  Go version 1.1 will be backwards compatible with version 1,\nand so on.\n\nFor more about what changed since r60.3, see \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/go1.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/go1.html\u003c/a\u003e\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
