The difference is that the tRNS\nchunk is 256 bytes long for sample.png and 254 bytes long for result.png. The final two\ntRNS bytes for sample.png are 0xff and 0xff.\n\nThe PNG spec at \u003ca href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11tRNS\"\u003ehttp://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11tRNS\u003c/a\u003e says that \"The tRNS chunk shall not\ncontain more alpha values than there are palette entries, but a tRNS chunk may contain\nfewer values than there are palette entries. In this case, the alpha value for all\nremaining palette entries is assumed to be 255.\"\n\nIt seems to me that Go's image/png package is writing a valid (shorter) tRNS chunk but\nyour viewing program (I don't know what it is called but it is what's seen in\ndifferent.jpg) is not following the PNG specification. The bug lies in that program, not\nin Go.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
