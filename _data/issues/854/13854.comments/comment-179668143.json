I did not workaround it in GCC yet because that revision was not going into production and newer versions of the chip is fixed.  It is worked around in OpenJDK though: http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev/hotspot/rev/6e2422a230fd . I should say the only place where a DMB is needed is right before the LDAR for the errata. ",
