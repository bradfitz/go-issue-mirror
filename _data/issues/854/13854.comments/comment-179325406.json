I'll keep looking in to this, but that's certainly sufficient, if overkill.\r\n\r\nI'm also not convinced I'm using ARMMEM correctly. Or the tool has a bug. I tried a `STLR a; DMB; STLR b | LDAR a; DMB; LDAR b` model and it came out *not* sequentially consistent, even though there's nothing I could do to make it stronger. I will note that it doesn't seem to say anywhere which ARM version the tool implements, even though ARMv8 is substantially different from ARMv7.",
