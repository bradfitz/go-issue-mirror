	"body": "The fact that this is a 1 in 10 failure suggests that it's probably not a compiler bug. I looked at the assembly for arm64 for Cas and Xchg for possible errors that might manifest only under contention. I don't see anything, but I also am not terribly familiar with the architecture. @4ad, maybe there is some subtle bug in those? Missing barriers? Incorrect behavior in Cas or Xchg if the the store-release fails? Something else? None of that is particularly well tested, although the very basic non-concurrent case does get tested at startup.",
