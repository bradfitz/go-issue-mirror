	"body": "I am going to close this bug. It seems the right default assumption that pre-production hardware is not commonly used. People using pre-production hardware should typically expect problems (generally, not just with Go). On top of that, the arm64 port is currently only experimental. Detecting this one buggy piece of hardware not in common use in our experimental port seems to me unnecessary complexity. For @vijaykilari and others, I think Austin's CL does fix the problem. Since people using arm64 are building from source already, it seems fine to have to apply an extra software fix for the hardware bug.\r\n\r\nAt the time we decide to make the arm64 port a first-class port, if evidence has arrived that the use of this buggy hardware is in fact common, then we can revisit detection and/or mitigation. But our default should be to assume it is not common.",
