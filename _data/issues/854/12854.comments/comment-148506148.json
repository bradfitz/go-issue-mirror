Which of the following would be in Go style?\r\n```go\r\nvar m = map[int]string{1: \"foo\", 2: \"bar\"}\r\nvar m map[int]string = {1: \"foo\", 2: \"bar\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFTR, I support more type elison and believe it will actually improve readability on complex structures like protobufs, where the embedded struct in use is obvious based on the field names used. The inclusion of the struct type is redundant and extra noise.",
