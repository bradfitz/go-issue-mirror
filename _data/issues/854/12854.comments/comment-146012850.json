The new concept is too big for\nGo 1, IMHO.\n\nFor example, composite literals for map and structs are different,\nso I don't expect that you can { A: 1 } assign to a map[string]int.\nAnd what will happen if the type doesn't have the A field? should\nthat be an error?\n\nAnd, if we have untyped composite literal, we need to figure out\nwhether we allow const untyped composite literals.\n\nBTW: I think every untyped type should have a default type,\notherwise it will be too confusing to use.\n",
