Note that to pass conditional arguments, you don't\nneed to declare a variable of the argument struct type.\n\nConsider this example:\nif something {\n     f(a, b, 1)\n} else {\n     f(a, c, 2) // a is duplicated, should arg1 in both branches stay the\nsame?\n}\n\nit will change to this for f that utilizes the proposal:\narg2, arg3 := c, 2\nif something {\n    arg2, arg3 = b, 1\n}\nf({A: a, B: arg2, C: arg3}) // now it's obvious, arg1 should always be a.\n",
