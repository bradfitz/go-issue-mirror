	"body": "I assume that this proposal is simply expanding the places in which you can elide a type literal. \r\n\r\nIf so, referring to it as untyped composite literals is a bit confusing as untyped has a specific meaning in Go.\r\n\r\nIt might make more sense to consider each place separately. I don't see much of a point, other than consistency, in allowing\r\n```\r\nvar t T = {}\r\n```\r\nsince you could just do\r\n```\r\nvar t = T{}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the rest would certainly cut down on typing and allow nicer APIs in places. \r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```\r\nPolygon({1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 4})\r\n```\r\nis arguably clearer than\r\n```\r\nPolygon([]image.Point{{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 4}})\r\n```\r\nand the only alternative at present would be\r\n```\r\nPolygon(image.Point{1, 2}, image.Point{3, 4}, image.Point{5, 4})\r\n```",
