I was already thinking about reasonable relaxations (such as elision when assigning into function-scoped variables).\r\n\r\nThere are some strange (probably useless) syntactic forms allowed with this degree of elision however, such as:\r\n\r\n    type T struct{}\r\n    T({}) // instead of T{}\r\n    \r\n    type P struct { *P }\r\n    \u0026P{{{{{}}}}}\r\n\r\nArguably the first form could be valid yet gofmt transformable into `T{}`, but the second form is the simplest representation of that structure -- it's confusing but potentially legitimate.",
