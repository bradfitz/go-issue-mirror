Mills \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e The major problem with the \"untyped literal\" perspective is the ambiguity\n\u003e (or asymmetry) between struct field names and map keys. Given the following\n\u003e program:\n\u003e\n\u003e const animal = \"gopher\"\n\u003e var x = {animal: \"rabbit\"}\n\u003e\n\u003e what should the type of x be? (Is it map[string]string, or struct{ animal\n\u003e string }?)\n\u003e\nI don't think we should attempt to define default types for\nuntyped/type-elided literals, so that would be an error no matter what.\n",
