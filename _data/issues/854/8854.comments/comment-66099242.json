Windows has\nsetsid WIN32 API calls, but as far as I know not command, so maybe it would require a\nslightly more involved fix of creating an extra command for present to run with setsid.\nBut I guess this report is good as a starting point.\n\nRefs:\n  [1] \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/playground/socket/socket.go?repo=tools#325\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/playground/socket/socket.go?repo=tools#325\u003c/a\u003e\n  [2] \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/playground/socket/socket.go?repo=tools#201\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/playground/socket/socket.go?repo=tools#201\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
