The first 3 quadwords are an RWMutex, 4th is\npointer to mongocluster, 5th is pointer to slavesocket.\n\nThe thing I just realized is that the dump means that regular pointers on the stack are\nbeing collected, which points the search away from a potential bug in the GC bytecode.\nAFAIK, the GC still treats values on the stack as arbritary pointers, so the only path\nthrough the GC bytecode is going to be defaultProg.\u003c/pre\u003e",
