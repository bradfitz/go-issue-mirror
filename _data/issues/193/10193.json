	"body": "Google Code is [shutting down](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html), and when it does, users who import from `code.google.com` will no longer have those dependencies resolve.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of things we could try to mitigate this breakage, and it won't happen for a while, but I think it may make sense to at least print a warning to users when running `go get`.",
