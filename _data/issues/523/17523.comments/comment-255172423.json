	"body": "\u003e The documentation https://golang.org/pkg/time/ is not sufficient to determine format string specification without examining source code https://golang.org/src/time/format.go .\r\n\r\nLet me disagree please. From the docs:\r\n\r\n\u003e The reference time used in the layouts is the specific time:\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e `Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006`\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e which is Unix time 1136239445. Since MST is GMT-0700, the reference time can be thought of as\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e `01/02 03:04:05PM '06 -0700`\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e To define your own format, write down what the reference time would look like formatted your way; see the values of constants like ANSIC, StampMicro or Kitchen for examples.\r\n\r\nThe format string in your example obviously is not 'what the reference time would look like formatted your way' b/c it uses `MON` instead of `Mon` etc, but nowhere is such thing documented to be allowed.",
