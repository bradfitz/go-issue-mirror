(I locally modified the context package to track the stack of who canceled a context)\r\n\r\nA \"return nil\" at the top of net/http/transport.go:getIdleConnCh \"fixes\" it, but that's not a real fix. I need to understand what's actually happening first.\r\n\r\n/cc @dpiddy (thanks for the 5ms sleep debugging hint)",
