I have seen the failure sometimes, but its reproducibility comes and goes from build to build, seemingly for no reason.\r\n\r\nI think that's the fix, though. I'll try on Linux later and write some more specific tests.\r\n\r\n/cc @pmarks-net who touched that code last and might be amused. (Not your fault! You fixed my original buggy code. It was just too subtle.)\r\n\r\n",
