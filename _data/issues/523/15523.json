	"body": "The asn1 package is fairly narrowly focused on marshaling / unmarshaling DER data.  \r\n\r\nI would like to propose incrementally improving the asn1 package to be more generally useful for working with all data related to the ASN.1 standard.  To start, I have created a new function `NewObjectIdentifier` to parse the string representation of a ASN.1 Object Identifier. \r\n\r\n```\r\n// NewObjectIdentifier creates an object identifier from it's string representation.\r\n// Supports ASN.1 notation and dot notation. OID-IRI notation is not supported.\r\nfunc NewObjectIdentifier(oid string) (oi ObjectIdentifier, err error) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have created a PR for it here as a preview: https://github.com/phayes/go/pull/1/files\r\n\r\nIf the go authors are interested in this, I'll roll it into a proper gerrit change-request. If they are not interested, I'll create a new 3rd party package. ",
