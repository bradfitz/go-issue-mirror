Don't know if I should\nuse pthreads as in my first approach (as a nice wrapper) or native windows threads.\nThe cygwin libc is certainly more attractive than the limited msvcrt.\n\nOther than that \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/install.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/install.html\u003c/a\u003e mentions now the windows port so this\nticket should be closed.\n\nI'm a bit busy now, but will come back sooon.\u003c/pre\u003e",
