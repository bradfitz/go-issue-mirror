I run a 4 GB Sony \nlaptop and have set up a 768 MB VM to run Xubuntu 9.10. Once you have basic install \nin place, just need to 'sudo apt-get install bison' and 'sudo apt-get install \nmercurial', then proceed with the usual Go install instructions.\n\nOnce I've run the VirutalBox guest additions, I run the VM in seemless mode. The \nLinux editor window and shell windows are side-by-side my Windows apps on the Windows \ndesktop. I'm using gedit 2.26.1 as my Go source editor for now. Selecting C \nhighlighting gives reasonable enough color syntax to Go source code.\n\nIt would be nice to start creating Windows-specific programs written in Go, but for \nthe purpose of learning Go programming, this approach is entirely viable.\u003c/pre\u003e",
