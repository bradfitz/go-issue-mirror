Go tools once compiled work great on their own.  The http\npackage and the filepath package works well on windows, at least I haven't come across\nany problems.  In other words, Go on Windows works for me.\n\nThe only \"pain point\" is running a Go compiled program as a windows service.  It appears\nthere isn't a Go callback function that can be called back into from another thread.  \n\nI do not have experience working with cgo on windows and thus can't comment on that\ntopic.\n\nI look forward to the compiled \"go command\". Will it be possible to set the header type\nwhen linking (-H windows or -H windowsgui)?\u003c/pre\u003e",
