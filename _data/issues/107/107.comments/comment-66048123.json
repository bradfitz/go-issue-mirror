Ideally, MinGW should be the one targeted for\nWindows users building GO, not Cygwin.  I would encourage the GO developers to mention\nor recommend Windows users to first install MinGW, run it's shell, and then proceed with\nstandard install instructions for GO to build. (I had to ask in the IRC channel to get\nthis easy trip to building/installing GO on Windows).  Further, users can open issues\nfor that standard MinGW build process when they occur, IMO.\u003c/pre\u003e",
