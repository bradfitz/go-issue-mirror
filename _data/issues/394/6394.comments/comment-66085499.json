It would be\nembarrassing for the slice and mutex if that combination were somehow faster than a\nslice+mutex alone. So \"buffered channels are slower than a slice and a mutex\" is working\nas intended.\n\nThere is a possibly bigger difference in your CL, though. The slice+mutex in fmt is a\nstack, and you are replacing it with a queue. If there are five entries in the cache,\nthe stack will just keep reusing one of them, while the queue will cycle through all\nfive. You'll touch less memory using the stack, which is part of why it's there.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
