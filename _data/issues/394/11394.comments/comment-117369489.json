Note that if you put @cespare's example into GOPATH and use an absolute import rather than a relative import, vet does the right thing.\r\n\r\nThis is a perennial problem at this point. The correct, deep fix is probably to stabilize the go/loader API (cc @alandonovan), put go/loader in the stdlib, and use it in cmd/vet.\r\n\r\nThe superficial fix is to not complain when we are missing type information, which seems like a better default anyway. I can send a CL for that if @robpike agrees.\r\n",
