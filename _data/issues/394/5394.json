I think this could work directly in the\ncompiler/runtime by mapping each name as a string value that could be retrieved in\nruntime.\n\nPlease let me know if this is something that would cost more than working around it as\nthe example above, even in a large project with dozens of constants.\u003c/pre\u003e",
