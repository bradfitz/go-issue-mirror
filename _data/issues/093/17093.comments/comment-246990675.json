What frustrated me was the fact that the documentation states that I should receive multiple records for this call, and the default behavior will only return one.\r\n\r\n`LookupAddr performs a reverse lookup for the given address, returning a list of names mapping to that address.`\r\n\r\nThe other really fun part of this is that (at least) BIND9 will return record results for a query in a random order.  This means that if `LookupAddr` only returns one name, if you query the same IP repeatedly, if it has multiple PTRs, you'll get a different single result each time.",
