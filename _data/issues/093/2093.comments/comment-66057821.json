Currently an attacker can do a multi-gigabyte POST to\nsome path, have the server reply with 401 Unauthorized, and then happily slurp up\ngigabytes just to throw them away.\n\nI'd like to change the behavior so that if the request body has not been fully consumed\nwhen WriteHeader is sent, it'll just be a Connection: close response instead.\n\nAlternatively, a threshold size under which we will slurp.\n\nI keep meaning to go look up what RFC 2616 says (if anything) about whether responses\nbefore requests are fully consumed are legal or not.  I can't remember.\u003c/pre\u003e",
