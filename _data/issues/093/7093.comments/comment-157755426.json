I already have a place in my filesystem where I do checkouts of things I'm working on, and I'd like to do the following:\r\nmkdir ${GOPATH}/src/myserver.tld\r\ncd ${GOPATH}/src/myserver.tld\r\nln -s ${HOME}/my/usual/path/to/my/project .\r\n\r\nI'd like to then see the documentation for the thing I'm working on in my godoc server.\r\nI have a fix written for this, it's a small change to golang.org/x/tools/godoc/dirtrees.go\r\n\r\nThe above symlink already works for building! I can use this just fine as\r\nimport \"myserver.tld/project\"\r\n\r\nGiven that, it's incongruous that `godoc` doesn't *also* work.",
