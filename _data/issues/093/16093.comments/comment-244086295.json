You can take a look at in patch set 1 of golang.org/cl/28349. See package internal/protopprof.\r\n\r\n1. Profiles will include symbol data. \r\n2. I don't think we've been setting that field in the newly open sourced code, but I don't see why not.\r\n3. It will continue. I don't see why it shouldn't extend to non-CPU profiles, but maybe someone else can comment on that.\r\n4. We're going to have to add some mechanism to the runtime for providing label annotations, but I don't know how that will work. I'm working on a proposal, but it's very much open for now. Once the facility is there users will be able to attach additional annotations to profile samples. The go pprof command already knows how to display them. When you get a graphical profile, little \"3-d\" boxes will appear coming out with each label. Here's a picture I grabbed: https://goo.gl/photos/5WWKPCpXFsyWDGRN7",
