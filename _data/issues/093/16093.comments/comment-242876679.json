Will they set the build_id field .. and will that be the contents of .note.gnu.build-id if present, or the Go toolchain's build id?\r\n3. CPU profiles on linux now include the contents of /proc/self/maps. Will this continue, and extend to non-CPU profiles as well?\r\n4. Where will labels be used?",
