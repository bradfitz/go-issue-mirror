Here is the\ncontents of the TCP Connection (I omitted the rest of the HTML page returned by the\nproxy):\n\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: google.com\nUser-Agent: Go http package\n\nHTTP/1.1 502 Proxy Error ( The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) does not use a recognized\nprotocol. Either the protocol is not supported or the request was not typed correctly.\nConfirm that a valid protocol is in use (for example, HTTP for a Web request).  )\nVia: 1.1 PTLIPRX001\nConnection: close\nProxy-Connection: close\nPragma: no-cache\nCache-Control: no-cache\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 4222  \n\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\"\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;HTML\u0026gt;\u0026lt;HEAD\u0026gt;\u0026lt;TITLE\u0026gt;Error Message\u0026lt;/TITLE\u0026gt;\n\nI made a full rebuild just to be sure and checked that I had no changed files locally\n(hg status).\n\nAny thing I can do to help debug it?\n\nThanks.\nNuno\u003c/pre\u003e",
