In that case, the current approach with adding it to `crypto/tls` seems fine to me (though I'd definitely prefer a separate package but I can see why you don't want add more packages to the stdlib).\r\nI was under the impression that the acme package would be added to the standard library which would make it's inclusion in `crypto/tls` or `net/http` redundant. I think I remember @crhym3 mentioning it somewhere. I'll try and find it. (edit: never mind I misinterpreted, sorry).\r\n\r\n@mholt \r\nI thought Lets Encrypt was the de facto ACME CA? I think it's used enough to warrant it's inclusion as a package level const because I am not even aware of any other public ACME CA. ",
