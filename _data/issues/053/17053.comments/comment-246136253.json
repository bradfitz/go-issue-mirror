Given this might it make sense to wait until the finalized stable API is available before adding this support to the stdlib in order to prevent churn and breakage in users who don't update?\r\n\r\nI totally agree. But Go 1.8 isn't due until 2017 anyway. The timing might work out? But even Go 1.9 is acceptable, if that works out best timing-wse.\r\n",
