The Let's Encrypt API currently implements a amalgam of the four ACME RFC drafts which we colloquially refer to as `v01`. Once the RFC is finalized we intend to implement a new API version, `v02`, which will be a strict implementation of the final specification language which will not be completely backwards compatible with `v01`.\r\n\r\nOnce `v02` is made public (we are currently aiming for somewhere around the start of 2017) we will provide a timetable for depreciating the `v01` implementation . Given this might it make sense to wait until the finalized stable API is available before adding this support to the stdlib in order to prevent churn and breakage in users who don't update?",
