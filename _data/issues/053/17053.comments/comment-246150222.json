This can be done already now. The problem is basically discovering the easy-to-use and high quality, maintained implementation.\r\n\r\nApplications need to specifically add support for ACME, and I don't think there's anything proposed here that would change that. Which path is used for import is not important, as long as applications written in Go remove the pain point of acquiring certificates.\r\n\r\nI'm not yet convinced that adding of the code to standard library makes a meaningful difference to end-user adoption. However an interesting compromise could be to add an EXAMPLE code to standard library docs, even if the package is external or vendored to Go distribution under x/.",
