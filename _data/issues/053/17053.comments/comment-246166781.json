This is an advantage for simple uses, which is the ultimate goal of this proposal - make it dead simple out of the box.\r\n\r\nMy only concern is incompatibility with future versions of ACME spec and Let's Encrypt implementation. However, if it becomes stable next year, as already discussed, this shouldn't be an issue in 2017.\r\n\r\nI like `ACMEListener`. A very similar thing was also proposed long time ago in https://github.com/google/acme/issues/14#issuecomment-168226991 by @bradrydzewski.\r\n\r\n\u003e  I'd consider it more or less bad practice to read/write to disk in a frontend binary\r\n\r\n@Merovius It's a cache. Certs are served from memory once fetched from cache.",
