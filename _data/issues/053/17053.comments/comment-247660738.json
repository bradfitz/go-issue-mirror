	"body": "Wouldn't it make sense to have something like a  _`security/driver`_ package (along the lines of _`database/sql/driver`_) so that one can use e.g. _`acme`_ or any other provider that has an API and decouple the implementation from the interface? It seems to work well enough for _`database/sql/driver`_ and there is no actual database driver in the language itself.\r\n\r\nNote: I'm not saying that the package shouldn't be included, just that it might be a good idea to have it in a way that makes it possible to swap implementation.",
