Wrote out a post saying what @rolandshoemaker said about upcoming ACME changes, but he beat me to it!\r\n\r\nAlso, ideally the design should encourage disk-based caching as much as possible. If Go programs are designed to issue on each startup, people will very quickly run into Let's Encrypt [rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/). I see that `autocert` already has a [`Cache`](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/acme/autocert#Cache), so it's probably enough to include the `Cache` mechanism in the library and make sure the examples use it.\r\n\r\nLastly: This is great, and I'm super happy to see it. This is exactly the type of thing Let's Encrypt exists to enable. Thanks!",
