See comments from @rolandshoemaker and @jsha.\r\n\r\n\u003e the functionality exists outside of the standard library just fine\r\n\r\nYes. And maybe all we do here is add documentation examples on how to use autocert. Maybe that's enough. I'd like it to be even easier, though.\r\n\r\n\u003e Does it mean that I can raise a proposal for having `? :` syntax in the language? \r\n\r\nYou can propose anything you like, but that discussion happened a long time ago and was already decided. If you insist on raising it again, please do it elsewhere and not in this issue.\r\n",
