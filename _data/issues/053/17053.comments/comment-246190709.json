	"body": "If saving a single vendor or `go get` is the only benefit, then I don't think it's worth the effort. As @raski mentions, any improvement in usability does not come from the inclusion in the standard library. The primary benefit of having it in the standard library, is that `net/http` or other standard libraries could use it directly. That, however, seems entirely unnecessary given the `acme.Listener` approach, which would provide similar convenience as direct integration.\r\n\r\nHaving the library be part of the stdlib wouldn't implicitly make it more visible, either. Without an announcement (which could just as well be about golang.org/x), you wouldn't know it was there. Any effort to increase awareness of this package could just as well go towards increasing awareness of a package in golang.org/x.\r\n\r\nI would think that making x/crypto/acme even simpler to use (`acme.Listen(network, address string, config *acme.Config) (net.Listener, error)` or something) would solve the usability problem sufficiently.",
