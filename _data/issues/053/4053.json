	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eIt would be very useful to be able to change the process name for reference in tools\nlike top. This is especially useful when a go executable starts additional processes of\nthe same executable. This is a useful workaround for when the 16GB memory limit is\nreached. It would be ideal if a method:\n\nfunc (p *Process) SetName(name string) error\n\ncould be exported from the os package and any platform specific code added to the\nsyscall package such as:\n\nprctl.set_proctitle for Linux\n\nI believe OS X requires overwriting/exposing argv to achieve the same effect. \n\nThere is an equivalent module for Python with lots of platform specific code:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/dvarrazzo/py-setproctitle\"\u003ehttps://github.com/dvarrazzo/py-setproctitle\u003c/a\u003e\n\nCheers,\nDonovan.\u003c/pre\u003e",
