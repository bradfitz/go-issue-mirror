I can reproduce the problem on my other Windows 7 Pro 386 SP1 VM.\r\n\r\nOn windows XP I seem to get the opposite results where `\\\\?\\c:` is not found but `\\\\?\\c:\\` is.\r\n\r\nHowever as @quentinmit suggested it does seem to be just whether you supply a trailing `\\` or not, it isn't a specific feature of the root directory.  So if I supply a trailing `\\` the listing fails and if I don't it doesn't.\r\n\r\nI've been unable to find a definitive answer as to whether trailing `\\` are allowed for `\\\\?\\` directory paths, or not.  From the testing above it seems to depend on Windows version.\r\n\r\nMaybe that is as it should be and Go shouldn't try and fixup Windows syscalls.",
