	"body": "@adg and I were discussing putting a little web app up in front of Github's actual issue tracker, to get better bug reports from users.\r\n\r\nThe old code.google.com bug tracker let us present different types of users (project owners/developers vs. users) different types of templates. Github has nothing. As a result, we get some pretty incomplete bug reports.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n* https://golang.org/issue/new and various other things would link or redirect to a new web app, e.g. https://bug.golang.org/\r\n* https://bug.golang.org/ would take the user through an auth flow to get their Github auth token with permission to file a bug.\r\n* https://bug.golang.org/ would then have users fill out a template form, asking the Go questions (version, OS/ARCH, go env, etc) which would help us debug.\r\n* upon submit, we post a bug to Github as the original Github user. (Bugs aren't posted as a robot account)\r\n* a bot would find bugs filed directly to Github without using the template and amend them with a hint to use the bug instead. Perhaps we even link to https://bug.golang.org/amend/NNNN where NNN is the incomplete bug report. We could then append to the bug with the details. The bot would not trigger for bugs filed by members of the project.\r\n\r\n@adg also proposed baking some bug-filing capabilities into the `go` command, but the details of that are fuzzy and would be the subject of a separate bug. Let's not discuss that part here.\r\n\r\n/cc @robpike @rsc \r\n",
