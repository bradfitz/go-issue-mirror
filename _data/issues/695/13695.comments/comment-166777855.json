	"body": "The feature request may fit in the responsibilities of the sensor package but there are two nitpicks:\r\n* Sensor package is event driven, will push lat/lon changes rather than returning the last known location. I am not sure if this is the desired API for location data.\r\n* Location data retrieval can be configured with various filters on both platforms, e.g. distance filters, precision levels (gps-only or gps- or network-based location). We need a API surface.\r\n\r\n/cc @crawshaw @hyangah  ",
