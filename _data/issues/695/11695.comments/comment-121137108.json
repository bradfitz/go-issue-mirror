As a result, we get some pretty incomplete bug reports.\n\u003e\n\u003e Proposal:\n\u003e\n\u003e    - https://golang.org/issue/new and various other things would link or\n\u003e    redirect to a new web app, e.g. https://bug.golang.org/\n\u003e    - https://bug.golang.org/ would take the user through an auth flow to\n\u003e    get their Github auth token with permission to file a bug.\n\u003e    - https://bug.golang.org/ would then have users fill out a template\n\u003e    form, asking the Go questions (version, OS/ARCH, go env, etc) which would\n\u003e    help us debug.\n\u003e    - upon submit, we post a bug to Github as the original Github user.\n\u003e    (Bugs aren't posted as a robot account)\n\u003e    - a bot would find bugs filed directly to Github without using the\n\u003e    template and amend them with a hint to use the bug instead. Perhaps we even\n\u003e    link to https://bug.golang.org/amend/NNNN where NNN is the incomplete\n\u003e    bug report. We could then append to the bug with the details. The bot would\n\u003e    not trigger for bugs filed by members of the project.\n\u003e\n\u003e @adg \u003chttps://github.com/adg\u003e also proposed baking some bug-filing\n\u003e capabilities into the go command, but the details of that are fuzzy and\n\u003e would be the subject of a separate bug. Let's not discuss that part here.\n\u003e\n\u003e /cc @robpike \u003chttps://github.com/robpike\u003e @rsc \u003chttps://github.com/rsc\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/11695\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
