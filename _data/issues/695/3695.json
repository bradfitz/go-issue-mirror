	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThis is possibly a duplicate of 3573, but is logged since the problem does not appear to\nbe completely fixed at tip, so it was suggested that I relog.\n\n$ go version\ngo version weekly.2012-03-27 +d8e47164f8dd\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. Run one of the variations of the program at:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/wG8AK7AAQl\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/wG8AK7AAQl\u003c/a\u003e\n\nVariations include changing const id = ... to var id = ... and also changing the values\nassigned to id. The struct sp can also be defined as a struct { string int string int }\nto the same effect as presented in the linked code.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe numbers 0-499 on separate line.\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe numbers 0-81 on separate lines followed by any of (variable results for any given\nprogram):\n1. 'throw: hashmap assert'\nwhen id is const or var \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, var or const \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, var ~\u0026gt;\n\u0026quot;naaa\u0026quot; (4-words checked only)\n\n2. 'invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference'\nwhen id is var \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n\n3. 'unexpected fault address'\nwhen id is const or var \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; or ~\u0026lt; \u0026quot;naaa\u0026quot; (4-words checked)\n\n4. no termination with 100% CPU usage.\nwhen id is const or var ~\u0026gt; \u0026quot;naaa\u0026quot; (4-words checked only)\n\nNB 4-words not exhaustively checked.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version weekly.2012-03-27 +d8e47164f8dd\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nUsing sf with only the int field or the string field results in normal behaviour.\u003c/pre\u003e",
