The variability goes down a tiny bit if you look at the number of files to compile, but not much. The variability is down to one order of magnitude if you look at the number of bytes to be compiled, but I don't think that we want to stat every file before getting started. Any other ideas for things to look at? As is, I think the best we can do for weights is very rough estimates, like fake=1, asm=10, gc=100, link=1000, cgo=1000. Any other ideas?\r\n",
