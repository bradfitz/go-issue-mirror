It spent the afternoon running three build tests in a loop: `go build -a std`, `go test -short std`, `all.bash`. I had everything else shut down, measured wall time, and ran the results through a t-test. At 50 iterations (20 for all.bash, which is SLOW), the CL showed no statistically significant improvement, and the means were within 1%.\r\n\r\nI then hacked in the best available predictor: Store previous action times on disk. Even with almost perfect weights, I got pretty much the same results.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this re-ordering hurts the experience of running all.bash, as there are long stalls between test outputs, which then come in spurts.\r\n\r\nMaybe this helps with lots more cores than I have--Brad, I guess I would like your help confirming that after all. As it is, though, I don't feel comfortable mailing the CL, since I have no way to demonstrate its value.\r\n",
