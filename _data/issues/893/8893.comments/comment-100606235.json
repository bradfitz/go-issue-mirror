It is possible to come up with dependency structure which will be handled arbitrary inefficiently by the old code. So some users can see higher speedup than we see on std lib. Moreover, currently scheduling depends on package names (or how does it order them now?), which is just weird. You can increase/reduce build speed by renaming packages.\r\n\r\nAlso, better scheduling will have more impact when we make actions finer-grained. In particular split cgo compilation and maybe asm compilation.\r\n\r\nSo I am sure that this is a positive change and we should do it. The additional complexity is minimal and very localized.",
