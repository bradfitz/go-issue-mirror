Something along the lines of:\r\nlink \u003e compile\r\nrun test \u003e link\r\nFake instant actions should have weight \u003c\u003c everything else.\r\nThe goal here is to avoid serial tail of actions that run one after another delaying whole thing.\r\n\r\nIdeally 'run test' weights represent actual execution time, so that runtime test starts first rather then starts late and delays all.bash. This may be possible in 'go test' continuos mode that monitors filesystem changes. But that's of course not a part of this change.\r\n",
