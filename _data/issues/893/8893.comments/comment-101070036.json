It doesn't make sense for me to continue to work on it when I cannot observe its impact (and thus can't tell whether my changes hurt or help).\r\n\r\n\u003e better scheduling will have more impact when we make actions finer-grained.\r\n\r\nAgreed. It is very coarse right now. And having thought about it more, simply saving the execution time of past identical actions might not be a bad long-term strategy for weight estimation.\r\n\r\n\u003e In particular split cgo compilation and maybe asm compilation.\r\n\r\nasm compilation is very fast. At least in the stdlib, there's very little cgo, so I don't think this will impact all.bash much, but it could make a big difference for heavy cgo users.\r\n\r\n",
