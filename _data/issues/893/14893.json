	"body": "Context: https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/10\r\n\r\nThe code below is surprising and confusing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tb := make([]int, 0, 5) // here b is made a slice with 0 len\r\n\tprintSlice(\"b\", b)\r\n\r\n\tc := b[:2]\r\n\tprintSlice(\"c\", c)\r\n\r\n\td := c[2:5]\r\n\tprintSlice(\"d\", d)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe sample on the side indicates that slicing a slice with len 0 returns a slice with len the same as cap. Further elaboration of this decision and its implications is appreciated.",
