	"body": "by **guohouzuo**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003e`go test` generates a very useful warning when there are no tests to run:\n\n    \u0026gt; go test\n    testing: warning: no tests to run\n    PASS\n    ok  mypkg  0.010s\n\nHowever, the behaviour is different when `-run` flag is involved:\n\n    \u0026gt; go test -run=DoesNotExist\n    PASS\n    ok   mypkg   0.011s\n\nIt will be really useful to suggest user of his/her mistake in the second case (with\n-run flag).\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
