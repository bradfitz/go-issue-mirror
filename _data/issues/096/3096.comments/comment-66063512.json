When we call ToRelative(...), it looks in this ascending sorted list for the\nfirst prefix match, and thus sees appengine before appengine_internal. It thus treats\nall links for appengine and appengine_internal as if they are for appengine, thus\nmessing up the generated links.\n\nAn easy fix is to keep Mapping.list in descending order, so that the longest match is\nmade first.\n\nI've tested the fix and it works. I'd follow up with a CL for review.\u003c/pre\u003e",
