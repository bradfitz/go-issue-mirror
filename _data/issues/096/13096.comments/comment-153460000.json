It is OK since curl is not started yet, but race detector does not see the synchronization behind starting curl and accepting a new connection. Can you just move setup of testHookOnConn above start of the server? It should get rid of the race. Can't test it as it requires some docker magic that does not work on my machine.\r\n\r\nHowever, there seems to be a false _negative_ there. If race detector sees a race here:\r\n\r\n\tvar gotConn int32\r\n\ttestHookOnConn = func() { atomic.StoreInt32(\u0026gotConn, 1) }\r\n\r\nthen it probably should also see a race on testHookOnConn var.",
