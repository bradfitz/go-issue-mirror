Such a mechanism seems impossible with\nflag.go. It would be useful to provide an array version for flags. Maybe flag.Array,\nflag.ArrayInt, flag.ArrayString, flag.ArrayVar, ...\n\nOf course, the above example is a simplistic case and there are plenty of common\nexamples for allowing more complex duplicate flags to be specified. See rsync and find\nfor two very common uses.\u003c/pre\u003e",
