	"body": "I agree with Russ for the reasons he stated.\r\n\r\nAn exit code is a single-dimensional value. When doing `go run`, there are 2 processes that run and 2 exit codes one may want to know.\r\n\r\nHowever, `go run` is only able to report a single exit code value, not two. It's not possible to losslessly combine two exit codes into one. If it reported the exit code of the program it ran verbatim, then information about the `go run` exit code would be shadowed and effectively lost.\r\n\r\nIMO, if one cares about the _exact_ exit code of the program that is executed, they need to build it and execute it themselves. `go run` is a convenience feature for when your needs are not as demanding and you're okay with less information, because it's unable to communicate more information than it already does.",
