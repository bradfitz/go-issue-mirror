You can see from the arguments\nto sort.Search that f = 0x189d94b0, and yet the crash says that the \nfaulting address is 0x0.  It is possible that the faulting address is incorrect.\n\nIt is interesting that the fault code is 0x80.  On Linux the fault codes\nfor SIGSEGV are typically smaller numbers (SEGV_MAPERR=1, SEGV_ACCERR=2).\n\nI suspect that your Fedora kernel is disallowing calls to runtime-generated \nfunctions (outside the text segment), and this is its way of telling us that.\n\nIt would be nice to confirm that Fedora does in fact do this, and then it would\nbe nice to know how to work around it.  Some day we might not use runtime\ncode generation for closures, but I'm not ready to give that up today.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **expertneeded**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **LongTerm**._",
