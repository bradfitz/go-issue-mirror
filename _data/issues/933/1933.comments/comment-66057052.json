The dynamic linker is already parsing shared library hash tables to hook up the\nsymbols referenced by the program.  To the dynamic linker, the VDSO is just another\nshared library.  Very little additional effort is required.\n\nBut what about statically linked executables?  (I hear you cry.)  They just don't take\nadvantage of the VDSO, which is OK because glibc and GNU/Linux don't like statically\nlinked executables anyhow.\n\nThat said, I'm fairly sure this code can be simplified somewhat, and I've been making\nsuggestions on \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/cl/6454046/\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/cl/6454046/\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/pre\u003e",
