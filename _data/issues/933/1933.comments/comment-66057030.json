The vDSO is an ELF DSO that's mapped into your\naddress space by the kernel, even if you're statically linked.  It is the preferred (and\nAFAIK only) way to access non-deprecated fast timing functions.\n\nThe attached code can be built without libc and almost finds symbols.  I'm not sure how\nto find the symbol string table, though.  And it's worth double-checking this stuff.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1933/4/static-vdso.c\"\u003estatic-vdso.c\u003c/a\u003e (3186 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1933/4/static-vdso-setup.s\"\u003estatic-vdso-setup.s\u003c/a\u003e (85 bytes)",
