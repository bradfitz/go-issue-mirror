Yes, it's in the state \"something works, but not\nsuitable for any real use\".\n\nI have removed the assumption about the __vdso_time index:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/krasin/vdso/commit/17427fb9edabafa4d17547acbb77f2189d2ba360\"\u003ehttps://github.com/krasin/vdso/commit/17427fb9edabafa4d17547acbb77f2189d2ba360\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThanks for pointing to this hack.
