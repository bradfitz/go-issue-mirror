There is now a reference parser that works in static binaries\nin Documentation/vDSO.  Its license should be compatible with the Go runtime.\n\nThe exception is that sys_getcpu is not available as a real syscall on all kernels.  So\nif statically-linked code needs to work on old kernels and uses getcpu, it should try\nthe syscall first and fall back to the vsyscall page if it gets -ENOSYS.  There are no\nkernels that will fault on vsyscall invocation and will also return -ENOSYS from\nsys_getcpu.\u003c/pre\u003e",
