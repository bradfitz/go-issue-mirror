Performance is nice, but\nnot if it means adding new confusing types for rare cases. That means all readers of the\nio package docs have the cognitive burden of seeing that new type and its docs and\nunderstanding why they should or shouldn't use it.\n\nIf a new type is only for performance, and the performance is actually worth it in many\ncases, and it's not something people can do on their own easily without forking lots of\ncode, then it's possible we could support it in more gross/magic ways.\n\nExposing io.LimitedReader (it used to be hidden) was already a bit of a compromise.\n\nBut now that LimitReader + sendfile works, it's unclear we need to make all the reader\nwrapper types work with sendfile--- you can make a LimitReader now and use it with\nReadFrom.  If you made the SectionReader then you already have the *os.File.\u003c/pre\u003e",
