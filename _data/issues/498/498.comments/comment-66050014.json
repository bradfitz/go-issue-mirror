I don't have enough experience now to help with that however ;).\n\n@imkrasin: for DOM access there is no Sodium chloride-support or port needed at all! \nI've never used it, but MS Silverlight supports accessing DOM with other languages \njust by altering your script type. With other languages it makes no big sense (and \nSilverlight makes it all slow), but with a statically typed fast compiling compact \n(consider var(a,b,c,d,e,f=10,7,8,1,5,9) and g,h,i=5,j(),[3]int{3,2,8} etc.) \nconcurrent language that is almost as fast as C, that makes more sense for me! A Go \ncompiler could compile even faster because the environment is already available.\u003c/pre\u003e",
