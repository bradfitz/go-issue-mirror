The current code is not what we want.  Can you +2 that CL?\r\n\r\n(I actually don't see how epoll_wait can return EBADF even if the program closes random file descriptors.  epoll_wait doesn't care whether the file descriptors it uses have been closed.  I can't see any kernel path that returns EBADF, except of course if the epoll descriptor itself is closed.)",
