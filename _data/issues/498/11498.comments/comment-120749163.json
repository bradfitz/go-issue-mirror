I agree that proper error handling of any transient errors and a throw on non-transient failures would be better. But if we now choose between a silent non-diagnosable hang and a \"runtime: epollwait on fd 7 failed with 9\" error message before hang; it is not clear to me what is better. And note that this print should not happen at all in correct programs (I don't remember any mentions of this print in the last two years). For example, this issue would not be failed if we would removed the print, which is bad. So what exactly situation you are trying to solve/improve by removing the print?\r\n",
