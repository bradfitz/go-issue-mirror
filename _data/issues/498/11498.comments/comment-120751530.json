That is the situation I am trying to improve: the one reported in this issue.  The program ran normally, except that it printed out a meaningless message.\r\n\r\nIf the choice is a meaningless message and a hanging program, or a hanging program without a meaningless message, that is no choice at all.  If those are the real choices--which if this issue is correct is not actually the case--then I choose the throw.",
