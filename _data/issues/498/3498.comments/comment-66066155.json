Perhaps, small go program that does something\nunexpected in your view. You have to say what your program should do / display. Provide\nsteps required to setup environment for you program run and describe your environment\n(OS and all). This description should be complete in a way, that, once someone made\nchanges to Go to make your example work, this issue will become resolved. Thank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
