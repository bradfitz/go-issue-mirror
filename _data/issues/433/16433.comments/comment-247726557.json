	"body": "While I don't disagree that validation might be out of scope for the core library, I do think that this mechanism (or something similar) is necessary. To take the example of validation - to create that external validation package would require either support from the core JSON package or an alternate implementation of the unmarshaller. It seems largely a waste of time (and almost certainly error-prone) to rewrite the JSON unmarshaller just for the purpose of exposing more information to the consumer. Modifying the core library to expose this information, on the other hand, is a relatively small change and enables external packages to greatly extend the functionality.",
