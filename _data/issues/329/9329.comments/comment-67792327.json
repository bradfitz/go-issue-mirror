I wouldn't be surprised if \u003e 50% of android users never ran a GL based app.\r\n\r\nAre you suggesting having a package with \"new to gles3\" funcs/enums only?  I would vote against that.  The new and old are too intertwined.  New enums that only work with old funcs.  New funcs that work with new and old enums.\r\n\r\nAlso GL Extensions are currently being ignored.\r\nAll of my gles2.0 android devices have extensions that make them much more usable.\r\nA device that is not capable enough to run all of gles3.0 may still run parts of it as extensions.\r\n\r\nSo old, new  and random extensions intertwined.  It is moderately chaotic.\r\n",
