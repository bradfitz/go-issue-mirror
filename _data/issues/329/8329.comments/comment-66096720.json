The TestSyscalls version is not doing the\nBind. They are not comparable.\n\nIf you need a special socket option before bind, the easiest way to do that is to create\nthe socket yourself, following the code in TestSyscall (but adding a Bind), and then\ncall net.FileConn(os.NewFile(fd)) to get a net.Conn for it.\n\nNote that calling the File method on a net.Conn puts it in blocking mode, which will\nlimit your scalability. So creating the socket yourself is probably the best option\nanyway.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
