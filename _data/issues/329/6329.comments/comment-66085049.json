Since the coverage tool isn't much use until your program can be compiled and run,\nthe problem isn't worth the attention a fix would require.\n\nIf it becomes possible to add comments to the AST through go/ast, this will be easy to\nfix, but I suspect a new ast package will be the real place to fix this.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-someday**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
