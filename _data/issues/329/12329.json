	"body": "I used to use the -a flag on go install a lot because I tend to update go all the time and sometimes stuff got stale.  I stopped using -a because it started rebuilding standard library which caused other interesting side effects.  Anyway, I stopped using it but I now have a real use for it and I would like to know if either the documentation is wrong or if there is a bug.\r\n\r\nFor example in one of my toy projects:\r\n```\r\n$ go install -v -a ./...\r\nruntime\r\nerrors\r\nunicode\r\nsync/atomic\r\nunicode/utf8\r\n...\r\n```\r\nIt clearly goes and rebuilds all the standard library stuff before it gets to my code.\r\n\r\nThe documentation says:\r\n```\r\n        -a\r\n                force rebuilding of packages that are already up-to-date.\r\n                In Go releases, does not apply to the standard library.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo which is it?",
