It looks adequately table-aligned in my browser.\r\n\r\nI believe the intended way to interpret that table is the line:\r\n\r\n    Range expression                          1st value          2nd value\r\n    \r\n    array or slice  a  [n]E, *[n]E, or []E    index    i  int    a[i]       E\r\n\r\n  - The \"Range expression\" column's cell is \"array or slice; a; [n]E, *[n]E, or []E\".\r\n\r\n  - The \"1st value\" column's cell is \"index; i; int\".\r\n\r\n  - The \"2nd value\" column's cell is \"a[i]; E\".\r\n\r\nThen the way to understand that is for a for-based range loop like\r\n\r\n    for i, x := v { ... }\r\n\r\nwhere v is of types `[n]E`, `*[n]E`, or `[]E`, then the range values produced for i and x (respectively) will be an `int`-typed index and its corresponding `E`-typed element `v[i]`.",
