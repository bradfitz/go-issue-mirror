You say that the build runs two different compilers\nat different points during the build, but I only have gcc installed\nand the build completes successfully on my system.\n\nIf you mean that the C compiler and the go compiler are both being used\nas part of the build process, I would agree that CFLAGS should not be\npassed to the go compiler, but in that case I am confused about why\nCFLAGS from the environment can't be passed to the c compiler.\n\nCan you please explain more what you mean?\n\nWilliam\u003c/pre\u003e",
