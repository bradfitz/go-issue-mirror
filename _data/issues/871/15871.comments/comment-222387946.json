IIRC, even if I cannot finish it, the next person to take my place most likely will be able to, however that brings me back to what you mentioned earlier... Documentation. If I managed to document for the next person (and if good enough to commit to the community) about my findings and implementations/improvements on the garbage collector. Not to mention that it will also satiate my desire to learn as the documentation would require intricate knowledge of what goes on underneath the hood of Go, heck, even Garbage-Collecting languages alike (assuming they all share some similarities).\r\n\r\nI know you might be trying to ward me away from this, but it actually rekindled a bit of hope that, if I do manage to finish it, maybe it won't be just rejected. So thank you, @josharian \r\n\r\nIt also drives home the reasoning he's making me implement the concurrent map... maybe I misinterpreted his request as it being a proposal and more of a trial. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I will close this issue as I definitely won't be attempting to propose a concurrent map (although I will be doing it privately) and instead I'll work towards the garbage collector.",
