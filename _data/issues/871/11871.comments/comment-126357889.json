Use `crypto/rand` -\u003e GOOD\r\n2. everything else -\u003e equally BAD\r\n\r\nYou argue that using a randomly seeded `math/rand` is somehow better than using a deterministic `rand/math`. I don't agree. Either your application is cryptographically secure, or is not. There's no \"more secure than\" among applications that use `math/rand` for cryptography. \r\n\r\n",
