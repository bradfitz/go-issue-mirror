If anything, the Go \"philosophy\" is the opposite.\r\n\r\nI think that seeding `math/rand` from `crypto/rand` will make the problem even worse, because then one could make an (ill-advised) argument for its security.\r\n\r\nI feel like providing NO options for a non-CSPRNG in a stdlib is a little opinionated, even for Go.\r\n\r\nI doubt it would be palatable, but I would quite like to see an `insecure` package, in the same vein as `subtle` - in other words, you need a _very_ good excuse to use it. We could hide all kinds of skeletons in this closet - RC4, MD5, DES ... and the PRNG. It would be difficult for anyone to mistakenly use `insecure/rand` for, eg, a password generator.",
