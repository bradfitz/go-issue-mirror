	"body": "While I agree with the principle of making sure that people use a secure random when it's appropriate, secure random isn't the only random that is necessary.  Simply replacing math/random with a secure random is likely to break existing promises about number distributions.  \r\n\r\nAdding the reference to the crypto/rand in the documentation would definitely be a good idea.  \r\n\r\nIf you make common tasks like random password/token/key generation really easy via the crypto/rand library then you are likely to encourage a lot more people down the secure path.  This may well be in a separate library, but so long as it's really really easy to use and google, it should help guide people onto the correct path.",
