	"body": "My 2 cents: things like randomizing map orders are meant to discourage developers from relying on unreliable things. It's not random \u003e deterministic, it's \"clearly unreliable\" \u003e \"apparently reliable\".\r\n\r\nHere what's unreliable is security, not determinism. You CAN'T use math/rand for security sensitive operations, however it's seeded. So IMHO the \"clearly unreliable\" option is for it to be deterministic. If it yielded different numbers every time, more developers would be fooled into thinking it's safe to use (\"apparently reliable\").\r\n\r\nSo if it's deterministic it's clearer that it's unsafe, and that's good, let's leave it like that.\r\n\r\nWhat I think would be useful and not barred by the compatibility promise is adding friendly APIs to crypto/rand, so that when I have to securely pick a number from a range, for example, I'm not tempted to use math/rand. I'll go as far as saying that crypto/rand should support all math/rand APIs, also because some of them are damn hard to get right on top of a []byte (see: modulus bias).",
