Only way not to get owned: `crypto/rand`.\r\n\r\nSo the question is, what makes less devs pick the \"you get owned\" door?\r\n\r\n1. make it clearer that `math/rand` is unsafe by leaving it unseeded, as @rsc and I are suggesting\r\n1. make the docs really scary, even more than 7cabade\r\n1. `go vet` checks sound awesome as they would also help against `goimports` mistakes, but how would they recognize non-security sensitive cases? Are we just ok with 100% false positives?\r\n1. make `crypto/rand` easier to use -\u003e add `math/rand` style APIs\r\n\r\n@shazow Even if 1. is not much effective, those that don't pick `crypto/rand` are 100% doomed, so anything that makes more devs pick `crypto/rand` is worth it, even if it makes `math/rand` \"more doomed\" (which it can't be).",
