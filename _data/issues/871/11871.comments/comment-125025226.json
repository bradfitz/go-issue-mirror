Much of Go's philosophy hinges on the fact that people cut corners and don't read docs, and so I tend to think that having a rand that isn't safe for crypto is unsavoury.\r\n\r\nI doubt people that don't read the docs enough to notice the difference between math/rand and crypto/rand would otherwise then be able to use crypto/rand to implement crypto primitives securely.\r\n\r\nCan you point at other popular language standard libraries whose only PRNG is a CSPRNG? There are plenty of use cases for fast, non-crypto PRNGs. (The math/rand PRNG isn't particularly fast, but that's a separate issue.)\r\n\r\n\u003e rename math/rand to math/deterministic_rand\r\n\r\nWill not happen due to Go's compatibility promise\r\n\r\n\u003e Seed math/rand with crypto/rands reader\r\n\r\nThat might lead people to think that math/rand has security properties that it doesn't.",
