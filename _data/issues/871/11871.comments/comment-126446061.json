If there was an obvious call to make to generate something like that, and it allowed you to specify all the bells and whistles you wanted like length and format, there would be no good reason not to use it.\r\n\r\nIn python they have [SystemRandom](https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html#random.SystemRandom) which provides exactly the same API as the regular random, and that's great when you're fixing code that has used the wrong random, but I have to agree that I'm not sure whether giving it the exact same API is the best idea.",
