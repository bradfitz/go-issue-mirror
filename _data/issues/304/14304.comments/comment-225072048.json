I don't think we should put both\n\u003e the benchmarks and the tools in a single repository because their audiences\n\u003e are different. The benchmarks are for performance analysis *of the Go\n\u003e core* and are only useful to Go core developers. The tools, however, have\n\u003e a much wider audience, since they're useful for anyone using benchmarks in\n\u003e Go.\n\u003e\n\u003e This suggests that we should 1) leave the benchmarks in their own\n\u003e repository, which might as well continue to be x/benchmarks, and 2) either\n\u003e create a new subrepo for performance tools and packages or put these in the\n\u003e x/tools repository. For 2, I don't have a strong opinion whether we create\n\u003e a new subrepo or use x/tools, except that x/tools is already a grab bag.\n\u003e\n\u003e I think creating x/perfdata still makes sense. And we should still modify\n\u003e the existing benchmarks to produce standard benchmark output and probably\n\u003e convert them to separate binaries for better modularity (I have several\n\u003e other benchmarks it would make sense to put in there, but that don't make\n\u003e sense to add to the existing monolithic binary).\n\u003e\n\u003e /cc @adg \u003chttps://github.com/adg\u003e @quentinmit\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/quentinmit\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/14304#issuecomment-224949811\u003e, or mute\n\u003e the thread\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/AIDilcGix0Hx5i1HEskoNpRJ4_vbZPfaks5qKD9ZgaJpZM4HYxl9\u003e\n\u003e .\n\u003e\n",
