Constraints may appear\nin any kind of source file (not just Go), but they must appear near the top of the file,\npreceded only by blank lines and other line comments.\"\n\nThe comment in my example conforms to this definition.\nNot treating it as a constraint because it also looks like a package comment seems like\na bad idea for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. The likelihood that someone wants a package comment in the exact format of a build\nconstraint seems low.\n\n2. Not treating as a build constraint can mean someone unintentionally shipping code\nthat they thought they had behind a debug flag.\n\nI hope you'll reconsider; at the very least I hope you'll update the pkg/go/build doc to\nsay the constraint must have nothing but blank lines \u0026 comments not only before, but\nalso after it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
