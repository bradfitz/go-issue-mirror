I think that's mostly true today but might not be in some possible GC implementations.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if p is a pointer into a global variable, we don't have an efficient way right now to determine, given p, the starting point of the containing global variable.\r\n\r\nIt also doesn't work on non-Go-managed memory, which will be confusing.  If a function gets two slices and uses Base to determine aliasing, why should it work for slices whose backing store is allocated by Go and not for backing stores allocated by mmap?\r\n",
