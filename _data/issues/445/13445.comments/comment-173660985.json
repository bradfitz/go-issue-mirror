Feel free to make a comment on the project if you have any questions. Its pretty directly adapted from another tutorial on go generics, which you can find here http://www.onebigfluke.com/2014/12/generic-programming-go-generate.html\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, I don't consider this a good solution. It feels hacky working with a wrapper on the objective-c/swift side, but it does work. Really would prefer something that feels more natural.",
