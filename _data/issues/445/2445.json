	"body": "by **watsonbladd**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eLooking at the code for crypto/elliptic I see that there are several branches in\nJacobian addition. These branches leak state on most systems. In addition there is no\nvalidation of points in the unmarshall function, and no documentation indicating that\nvalidation is required.\n\nSuggested fix: add to documentation that validation of all points sent and received is a\ngood idea and use addition laws without special cases.\u003c/pre\u003e",
