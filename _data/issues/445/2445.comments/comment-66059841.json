The lack of validation of curve membership, together with the fact that the\nJacobian addition formula and doubling formula do not depend on the curve, lead to an\neasy attack on Diffie-Hellman implementations using them without validation, by picking\npoints on curve of smooth orders.\u003c/pre\u003e",
