I've written a constant time\nP224 in C++, which could be ported:\n\u003ca href=\"http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/crypto/p224.cc?revision=108903\u0026view=markup\"\u003ehttp://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/crypto/p224.cc?revision=108903\u0026view=markup\u003c/a\u003e\n(although it's simple rather than fast.)\n\nThe constant time P256 and P521 that I wrote are the OpenSSL implementations\n(crypto/ec/ecp_nistp256.c). However, they're designed for 64-bit machines and use a\n64-bit full-mult, which Go doesn't have native support for. (math/big uses asm to get at\nit on platforms that support it.)\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-low**, **packagechange**, removed **priority-medium**._",
