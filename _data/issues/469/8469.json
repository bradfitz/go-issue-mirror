	"body": "by **sverre.bakke**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eos.ExpandEnv will expand/resolve unix style environment variables based on the $var or\n${var} style. However, on Windows, environment variables uses %var% as format instead.\nThis means that when writing Windows code, strings that refer to environment variables\n(e.g. from configuration files, registry, or even other environment variables) will need\nto be either converted to unix style environment variables before expanding or have to\nbe manually expanded.\n\nGo should have a Windows spesific version of the ExpandEnv() function that will use\nWindows style expansions instead of Unix style expansions.\n\nGolang currently uses the following format for all operating systems:\nfmt.Println(os.ExpandEnv(\u0026quot;${systemroot}\\\\test\u0026quot;))\n\nThe correct way on windows is as follows:\nfmt.Println(os.ExpandEnv(\u0026quot;%systemroot%\\\\test\u0026quot;))\u003c/pre\u003e",
