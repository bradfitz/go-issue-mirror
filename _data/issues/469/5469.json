	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eFrom the mailing list:\n\nA year ago, around Google I/O, we were talking about Go\nwishlist items and it came up that some people miss having\na compiler that checks switch case coverage (like some C\ncompilers do with enums). As I recall, Rob said it doesn't\nbelong in the compiler (naturally) but would be a good\naddition to go vet.\n\nNot sure about the details, but I think the general idea would\nbe to have go vet report a problem when some but not all\nvalues from a const block are used as cases in a switch.\u003c/pre\u003e",
