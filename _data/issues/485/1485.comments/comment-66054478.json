I'm using the package that comes with\nArch Linux, so there is no obvious or \"natural\" way of updating the compiler (and the\nArch packages are pretty fresh, in general).\n\nHowever, I can checkout Go and install it from sources, if that's the blessed course of\naction. In fact, I can wrap the Go compiler in a script that always updates the sources\nfirst, just in case I would stumble upon a bug. ;)\n\nIn all seriousness, thanks for looking at and closing this issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
