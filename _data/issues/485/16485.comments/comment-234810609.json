	"body": "Thank you for problem report. I agree there is a problem in that code.\r\n\r\nWe even have test for it - TestMoves. The test is broken, but no one noticed because TestMoves is skipped on windows (by mistake). @alandonovan sent https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/24969 to enable the test, but then he discovered the test is broken.\r\n\r\nI came to similar conclusion to yours. You can see my comment at the end of https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/24969\r\n\r\nYou can wait for Alan to get around to complete CL 24969. Or you can send alternative solution, if you like - it sounds like you have researched this area quite a bit. This https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html is how to contribute.\r\n\r\nAlex",
