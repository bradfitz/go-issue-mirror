The spec says\n\n\"Implementation restriction: A compiler may make it illegal to declare a variable inside\na function body if the variable is never used.\"\n\nI don't think x is inside the function body here. Both because of that and because gc\nhas accepted the program already, I don't think we can change this for Go 1.x.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **go2**, removed **release-go1.3maybe**._",
