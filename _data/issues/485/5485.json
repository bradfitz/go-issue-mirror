	"body": "by **jasaugusto**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the\nlatest release. =\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Checked, and didn't found any similar.\n\nSearch the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go. =\u0026gt;\u0026gt; It is Go 1.1, fresh version, installation done with\nbinary go1.1.windows-386.msi and also with archive go1.1.windows-386.zip. Failure in\nboth.\n\nThe crash dump is shown in one of the attached pictures.\n\nComments: \n\n1) Windows 2000 with all updates done (until discontinued, of course ;-)\n\n2) Go 1.0.3 was running perfectly\n\n3) The \u0026quot;offending directory\u0026quot; is in picture Go1.1Crash.png.        \nC:/Users/ADMINI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/2/bindist664137607/go/src/cmd/go/ve\nt.go:37 +0x4b\nbut C:\\Users doesn't exist in my machine (see picture Go1.1CrashCDir.png)\n\n4) Uninstalling the .msi and unzipping the go1.1.windows-386.zip archive gives\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;exactly\u0026lt;\u0026lt; the same output. So it seems not to be a problem from the\ninstaller.\n\n5) Processor is an old AMD (see picture Go1.1CrashSysInfo.png)\n\n6) What steps will reproduce the problem? =\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Really not enough info to suggest\nsomething... Some other Windows 2000 box perhaps (I have another W2K box, in another\nplace, I'll try to reproduce in a couple of days)\n\n7) I'll try to compile the sources with mingw (I have the 4.6.2 toolchain installed) and\nreport ASAP.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5485/0/Go1.1Crash.png\"\u003eGo1.1Crash.png\u003c/a\u003e (11134 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5485/0/Go1.1CrashCDir.png\"\u003eGo1.1CrashCDir.png\u003c/a\u003e (3139 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5485/0/Go1.1CrashSysInfo.png\"\u003eGo1.1CrashSysInfo.png\u003c/a\u003e (5236 bytes)",
