'Go version' works OK.\n\nMeanwhile I started to compile Go1.1 from the sources in mingw,\nbut there were errors. I'll try to figure out what is happening ASAP. \n(I have two work seats, plus home, and commute :-)\n\nI will not quit, I think Go is the way to go ;-)\n\nKind Regards,\n\nJos√©\u003c/pre\u003e",
