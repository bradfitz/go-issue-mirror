	"body": "@RLH and I talked about marking objects reachable from finalizers during concurrent scan rather than mark termination today. We concluded that it probably should Just Work modulo one quirk: if SetFinalizer is called *during* a GC cycle, it must itself call scanobject on the object. Otherwise, it's possible to have objects A -\u003e B where A is reachable at the beginning of GC, but does not have a finalizer at the time of concurrent scan; then during concurrent mark, the mutator sets a finalizer on A, then makes A unreachable before it gets marked. If SetFinalizer doesn't call scanobject, B won't be marked and may be collected before A's finalizer runs.\r\n\r\nWe might also need more locking. There are comments in addspecial/removespecial claiming that it's okay for the GC to access the specials list without locks, but they don't explain why and I'm not sure I believe them.",
