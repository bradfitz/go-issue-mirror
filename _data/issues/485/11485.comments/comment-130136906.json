	"body": "The current cost of finalizers is O(# of finalizers + # of spans). The constant on the (# of spans) term is about 1ms/heap GB. I haven't done the profiling to determine the constant on the (# of finalizers) term, but it does mean that even if we eliminate the marking for some finalizers, we still have the (# of spans) term. If the constant on O(# of finalizers) turns out to be high, then I think your suggestion may be a good direction. But I suspect it is low and just moving it to concurrent mark should be enough, since the cost of the whole mark phase is much higher than 1ms/heap GB.\r\n\r\nOf course, improving on the (# of spans) term is good, too. Currently, we just loop over all of the spans to find spans with finalizers. We could keep a better data structure instead.\r\n\r\nNote that the finalizer on net.netFD objects is more complex than on os.File objects. However, it looks like everything the finalizer actually touches is still pointer-free (except on nacl!).",
