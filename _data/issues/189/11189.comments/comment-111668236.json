	"body": "The hash is tricky, and not because of the hash function itself.  Use SHA256 if you want.  The trick is figuring out what data to hash.\r\n\r\nConsider these two blocks:\r\n\r\nb1:\r\nv3 = Add v1 v2\r\nv4 = Add [1] v3\r\n\r\nb2:\r\nv5 = Add v1 v2\r\nv6 = Add [1] v5\r\n\r\nWhat do I hash here?  The blocks are equivalent, but the values aren't identical.  Something simple like sorting and hashing the opcodes will work, but may have lots of false positives.  We'd really like to hash the \"dataflow\" also, whatever that means.  And even if the hashes match, determining equality isn't easy.  This basically boils down to a graph isomorphism problem.  We have the luxury of failing if it isn't obvious, but even so I don't think it is trivial.",
