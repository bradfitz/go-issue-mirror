I am inclined to say that we should at least code this up, maybe as a separate pass right now so that we can turn it on and off and measure its effects.  I have a bee in my bonnet to look into how we do stack traces already so that we can improve our inlining story (i.e., so we can inline functions that are not inlineable all-the-way-down) and perhaps we can also concoct some better way to talk about the line numbers of commoned code.",
