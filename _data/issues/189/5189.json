I added two local bools and that pushed me past the end of my space for\nno-split-stack threshold when using the race detector (all.bash failed at the \u0026quot;go\ntest -race flag\u0026quot; step, with a nosplitstack overflow assertion)\n\nLooking at my locals, debating which existing variable I could {re,a}buse, I noticed\nthere was a lone uint8 between a bunch of pointers.\n\nOn a whim, thinking it couldn't be, I moved the byte down by the other bytes.\n\nAnd it worked. Ordering matters.\n\nCarl asked me to file a bug so the compiler sorts its local by size for better packing.\u003c/pre\u003e",
