Will take a look now.\n\nNote that the reference implementation is not yet hooked up to the API,\nwhich is still on the TODO list. But if you intend to use it let me know.\n\nThanks,\n\nMarcel\n\nOn Thu, Sep 22, 2016 at 8:53 AM, Deepak Jois \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e Here is a change to support updates to the Bidi algorithm in Unicode 8.0:\n\u003e https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/29630/\n\u003e\n\u003e @mpvl \u003chttps://github.com/mpvl\u003e, I guess you are the right person to look\n\u003e at this?\n\u003e\n\u003e I am the author of luabidi \u003chttps://github.com/deepakjois/luabidi\u003e. I\n\u003e initially referred the Go implementation along with the reference Java\n\u003e implementation to write a line by line port of the reference code to Lua.\n\u003e However, both the Go version and the Java reference version do not support\n\u003e the changes to the algorithm made in Unicode 8.0.\n\u003e\n\u003e I looked at the changes in the C version, and then modified my Lua\n\u003e version, as well as the Java reference version\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/deepakjois/BidiReferenceJava\u003e. Finally, I decided to\n\u003e port the implementation to Go as well, just to get some more confidence.\n\u003e These changes have been tested pretty thoroughly both in Lua and in the\n\u003e Java reference implementation.\n\u003e\n\u003e I had to make a minor change to the test file to get the tests to pass.\n\u003e But I believe, that change should have been there in the first place, if we\n\u003e go by the Java reference version.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/17189\u003e, or mute the thread\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AGJZR_fjq9AkK7IrK1T8u04f2DpjNtxvks5qsiXSgaJpZM4KDlBL\u003e\n\u003e .\n\u003e\n",
