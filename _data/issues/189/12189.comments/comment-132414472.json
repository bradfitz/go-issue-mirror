The problem is that by default, and even when you set GODEBUG=netdns=go, the code tries the new C library wrappers before trying pure Go. \n\nSo not only did the result change, but now each blocked LookupAddr takes a full thread instead of a goroutine. That behavior definitely has to be rolled back.",
