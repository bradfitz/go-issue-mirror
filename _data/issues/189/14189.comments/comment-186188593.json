	"body": "I retested go 1.5.2 and 1.6 versions of our service with varying GOMAXPROCS values (3, 6 and 8). GOGC was left as default. I didn't see any appreciable change in latency. If I squinted hard I might say that the network operation \"augment\" saw a slight improvement at higher GOMAXPROCS and the cpu operation \"evaluate\" saw a slight worsening.  I can post images of our metrics but it hardly seems worth the noise.\r\n\r\nI took multiple cpu profiles of the service with default settings for GOGC and GOMAXPROCS under Go 1.4.3, 1.5.2 and 1.6. I can make those available with binaries privately if you think they will help. Email me at me@iandavis.com and I will share a link to them. I have had a superficial look at them and nothing leaps out as obviously different. \r\n\r\n",
