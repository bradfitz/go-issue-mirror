	"body": "It looks our GC rate in 1.6 is 1.5X what it was in 1.4. Based on your logs, go-1.4.3.txt does 762 GCs in 8.73 minutes = 87 GCs/minute and go-1.6.txt does 856 GCs in 6.35 minutes = 135 GCs/minute. I haven't analyzed the heap sizes yet, but that suggests we're keeping the heap somewhat smaller than 1.4 did, which is simply forcing the GC to do more work. It would also be good to compare the scan rates (bytes/sec). Comparing the heap size CDFs and the scan rates should give us a better sense of whether this is a raw GC throughput problem or a heap trigger problem.",
