Interesting.\r\n\r\nUsing `GOGC=1600`, I got the following:\r\n\r\n| version | points/sec | response time |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Go 1.4.3 | 496,271 | 24.67ms |\r\n| Go 1.6rc1 | 452,760 | 17.08ms |\r\n\r\nSo, the response time for both came down, with a greater improvement on 1.6rc1. It's now in line with what I'd expect for the new GC, but we're still seeing better performance with 1.4.3 on overall throughput.  Does the `GOGC` parameter behave the same way on 1.4.x as it does on later versions?",
