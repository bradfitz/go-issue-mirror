	"body": "I just wanted to revisit this issue and let everyone know that as of v0.13.0 (released today), InfluxDB is now being built with Go 1.6.2.\r\n\r\nWe did a lot of work over the last couple of months to reduce unnecessary allocations, but the GC performance in Go has also been steadily improving. Based on our own internal testing (influxdata/influxdb#6511) and user feedback (influxdata/influxdb#5217), we're consistently seeing better performance across the board when using Go 1.6.2. This is also without tuning the `GOGC` parameter, which further improves performance.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue out because I don't think it represents an actionable item for the Go team any longer. For anyone else who still sees better performance on Go 1.4.3, I'd recommend working to identify and reduce unnecessary allocations - you'll be happier for it!\r\n\r\nFinally, we're seeing even better performance with `tip`, so we'll be looking forward to Go 1.7 later this year. Thanks to the entire Go team for all of the help and responsiveness along the way!",
