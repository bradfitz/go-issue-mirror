	"body": "That makes sense to me - the patch I uploaded doesn't support using a comma where a period is specified in the format string (and vice versa). That does seem like localization.\r\n\r\nThe patch does support the case where there's no fractional seconds part in the format but there are fractional seconds with a comma in the string, like:\r\n\r\n{\"2006-01-02 15:04:05\", \"2013-08-19 22:56:01,234\"}\r\n\r\nbut I would be willing to remove that if it's too localization-related. The real crux of the issue is that there's no way to parse a date that uses a comma as a delimiter using any format string.",
