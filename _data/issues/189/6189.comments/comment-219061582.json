Extraction, segmentation, numbers, among other things are higher on the list right now.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think it is not unreasonable for the standard lib to support case 2 of the play example:\r\n\t\t{\"2006-01-02 15:04:05,000\", \"2013-08-19 22:56:01,234\"}, // decimal comma\r\nas it is unrelated to localization, I would say, and a localization that wants to build upon the existing time package would need such support.\r\n\r\nThe third case:\r\n\t\t{\"2006-01-02 15:04:05.000\", \"2013-08-19 22:56:01,234\"},\r\nseems to be more a localization feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
