Those users would unexpectedly get no HTTP/2. Even worse, I can see a small change moving some code from DefaultTransport to a copy of DefaultTransport passing code review as \"sure that does not change anything\", and instead degrading service. And I see no good way to figure out why two identical Transport behave differently.\r\n\r\nMaybe just plainly documenting that ExpectContinueTimeout does not apply to HTTP/2 connections and always ignoring it is more clean and simple. Also considering that ExpectContinueTimeout is new and no one is relying on it yet.",
