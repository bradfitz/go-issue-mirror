I worried about the surprise change, but there are already at least two surprise elements to this as-is:\r\n\r\n1. new(Transport) and http.Get can differ.\r\n2. new(Transport) to foo.com can do one thing today, and a different thing tomorrow, regardless of your Go version, just because foo.com added HTTP/2 support. So people were already making major codepath changes somewhat outside of their control. (but they could force-override it to HTTP/1)\r\n",
