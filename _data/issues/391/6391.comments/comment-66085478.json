It instead relies on the operating system to\nprovide access to a set of root CAs. On OS X and Windows there are standard\nsystem library calls to validate certificates. On the various Unixes there\nis by convention a set of root certificates at one of a list of well-known\nplaces. I agree with OpenSSL that they shouldn't be deciding that policy\neither, but I would have expected SUSE to ship with a basic set, like the\nother Linux distributions.\u003c/pre\u003e",
