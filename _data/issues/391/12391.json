	"body": "Methods on `*os.File` return `ErrInvalid` when the receiver is nil. This is, however, not documented anywhere. Usually this would be fine, if it weren't for a lot of documentation on methods saying `If there is an error, it will be of type *PathError`. \r\n\r\nOperating on nil `*os.File`s is a programming mistake and shouldn't be a common occurence, so it shouldn't complicate all of the documentation. However, a note in the package-level documentation could be an easy fix for a small inaccuracy in the rest of the documentation.",
