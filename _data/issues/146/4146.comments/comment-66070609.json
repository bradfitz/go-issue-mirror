The existing API for GoMock generated code only exports the\nmock implementation of the interface; the recorder is returned by an\nEXPECT method on that. I don't see any reason why something needs to\nbe imported. Instead of\n  foo := mock_foo.NewMockFoo(ctrl)\nyou could write\n  foo := gomock.NewMock(ctrl, (*Foo)(nil)) // passing a pointer to the interface\nand get back a dynamically created mock.\u003c/pre\u003e",
