	"body": "The single letter check is not meant to intentionally accept \"terrible\" as true and \"factual\" as false. It is simply a mistake introduced when ,string was added. Originally the JSON parser was only letting true, false, and null through to that case, so looking at the first letter was sufficient. But the ,string code started passing arbitrary strings to that code and didn't first check to see if that was appropriate. Just a bug, not intended, nothing more.\n\nShould be easy to fix.\n\nThanks for the simple case @kostya-sh.",
