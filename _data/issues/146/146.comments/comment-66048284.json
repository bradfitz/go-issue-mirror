It compiles and installs but fails with that error above.\n\nI've attached the stdout and stderr output so you can see it's not pebkac :-)\n\nI didn't have hg or easy_install on that old machine, so I cloned it onto a FC11\nmachine and rsynced the directory tree to the FC6 machine where I ran all.bash.\nHowever, I did this before any attempt to build it in the FC11 machine so it was clean.\n\nIn my case also cat /proc/sys/kernel/hostname simply shows me my expected hostname.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/146/6/trace\"\u003etrace\u003c/a\u003e (478614 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/146/6/gotest.out\"\u003egotest.out\u003c/a\u003e (454 bytes)",
