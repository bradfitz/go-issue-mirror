For more information on PRECIS see [RFC 7564][rfc7564] ([txt][rfc7564_txt])\r\n\r\nI am filing this issue in accordance with the [contributing](https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html) document, and have started implementing a package which might be used for a base here: https://bitbucket.org/mellium/golang-x-text. I will be happy to keep iterating on this if it does look like something that would warrant inclusion in `x/text`. Feedback on the approach would be appreciated (though perhaps the mailing list is a better place for that? The guidelines are a bit vague when it comes to the `x` packages and how their development is handled).\r\n\r\n[rfc7564]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7564\r\n[rfc7564_txt]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7564.txt\r\n[godoc]: https://godoc.org/bitbucket.org/SamWhited/go-precis",
