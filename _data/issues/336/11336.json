	"body": "`eqstr` checks for pointer equality before looping over the body. `bytes.Compare` could do the same. The obvious question is whether this is a common enough case to warrant paying the price. I'm not sure how to gather data make this determination. Perhaps by instrumenting `bytes.Compare` and running some large, real-world code?",
