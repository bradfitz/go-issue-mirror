For example if you are using something like Bonjour (yes it\nworks on Linux) to resolve names to IP addresses, Go programs won't be able\nto do that. But I imagine that's rare.\n\nInside Google we arrange to use the pure Go version (instead of the cgo\ncalls into glibc) on Linux because the Go version scales so much better.\n\nPerhaps we should make the default on Linux and the BSDs be 'not cgo'?\u003c/pre\u003e",
