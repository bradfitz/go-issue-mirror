	"body": "Hi Brad,\r\n\r\n\r\n1) RootCA approach: validating a self-signed certificate is generally different from the process of validating a chain of traditional PKI certs, and as far as I know, there is no value of tls.Config.RootCA that would allow the current validation routines to do the right thing.  I could try experimenting with this idea.\r\n\r\n2) http Client approach: I am not familiar with the http subsystem to comment on whether this is a feasible suggestion.  However, I need raw sockets so it wouldn't help me if it could.  \r\n\r\n3) InsecureSkipVerify approach: It looks like I _might_ be able to do as you suggest with tls.Conn -\u003e ConnectionState -\u003e PeerCertificates, but its not entirely clear how to get the tls.Conn from the tls.Dial which seems to return a net.Conn.  Any suggestions?\r\n",
