Re-reading \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/ref/spec#Assignments\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/ref/spec#Assignments\u003c/a\u003e\nI found this example which makes it clear that the examples you give\nabove are legal.\n\nvar w int64 = 1.0\u0026lt;\u0026lt;33  // 1.0\u0026lt;\u0026lt;33 is a constant shift expression\n\nHowever, I changing the above example to\n\nvar x float32 = 1.0\u0026lt;\u0026lt;33 // 1.0\u0026lt;\u0026lt;33 is a constant shift expression\n\nwhich clearly shows that the \"type of the constant is what it would be if the shift\nexpression were replaced by its left operand alone\" mechanism only comes into play \"if\nthe left operand of a non-constant shift expression\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
