	"body": "@rsc I'll double check, I tried to push several commits (with commit ID's) and I think it just told me that I had to squash first. If not, that would be far better! (although I still don't understand the need for commit ID's when Git already has commit ID's, and patch sets [aka branches/tags/any other ref], etc.)\r\n\r\nUsing the pre-commit hook sounds good; thanks. I'll start making separate reviews after the major body of the work is reviewed / merged.\r\n\r\nRE: replying on Gerrit, I think I did reply to everything, no? I just wanted to leave updates here to keep this issue up to date; if these issues are just meant for proposals and not to track the work though, I can stop. I'm still figuring out the workflow.\r\n\r\n*EDIT:* Ah, just saw your thread on go-dev talking about this and saying you'd update the contribution guidelines. Many thanks!",
