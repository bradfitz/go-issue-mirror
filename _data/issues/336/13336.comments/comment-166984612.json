	"body": "So the released version of RFC 7700 includes case mapping as part of comparison only (and not enforcement). Since case mapping is something that definitely can't always be done as part of comparison (it is sometimes required during enforcement, in which case it has to happen before some of the other steps), I think we really do need a generic API for defining where each step happens.\r\n\r\nI don't really have any good ideas; the best thing I've thought of would be to have a transform option for pre-prepare and pre-compare. Other suggestions welcome.",
