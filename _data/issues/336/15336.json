	"body": "As h2 spec : http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#CONNECT\r\n\r\nwhen we receive a CONNECT request, we should open a tcp connection to the target server identified in the :authority..and response to sender an 2XX, then pipe client connection and target server connection..\r\n\r\nBut in current h2: we can't response sender with and only with 2xx code, `WriteHeader(code int)` alway take content-length and other headers in and it causes some problems( http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#CONNECT) and let client don't send any more data\r\n\r\nExcept that, h2-server always send 2xx and some headers to client after `http.Handler` finish its execution..and how can we forbidden this? because in 'proxy' situation, data will be exchanged between client and proxied server, proxy should not generate a 'response' by itself...(except previous response 2xx code to client)\r\n\r\nIs there a recommend way to send client only one `HeaderFrame` with `:status: 200` and forbidden 'after handle done response(just like http1.x `w.conn.hijacked()`)'?",
