	"body": "Thank you for the information about gcimporter15. If that works as I think, that might even let me get rid of the hacky dependency I took.\r\n\r\nFor Kythe, our goal is to be able to capture the files involved in building a Go package and to (later) re-run the type checker from those. An ideal API for our use case would be something like a function that takes a compiled package (say, a `.a` or `.gcgox` file) and returns whatever the `go/types` package needs to use it for type resolutionâ€”presumably a package name and some other internal state. We don't care at all about the internal format of this information as long as there's a way to get `go/types` to use it.\r\n\r\nHaving the API move around is fine, as long as it's a public API. ",
