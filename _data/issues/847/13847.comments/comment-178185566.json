	"body": "1) The API - as it was designed for 1.5 - didn't take into account vendoring (at that point considered an experiment introduced late). As a consequence, the current API (go/importer.Lookup function) may have to change. Since it cannot (Go 1 backward-compatibility promise) we need to come up with a new API. We didn't hurry this for 1.6 because we got to it too late and didn't want to prototype yet another possibly incomplete API.\r\n\r\n2) The export data format is going to change for 1.7 (the new format is already implemented but for inlined exported functions). It shouldn't affect the API, but it might.\r\n\r\nIn terms of help: It would be good to have examples of concrete use cases, ideally with suggested minimal API. This would help clarify the final solution.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, we have x/tools/go/gcimporter15 which provides (I hope) all the individual pieces to  import from custom locations and it is based on the 1.5/1.6 std repo go/types. Does that help?",
