	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version devel +ac1608a Thu Mar 10 15:54:08 2016 +0000 linux/ppc64le\r\n\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nppc64le using a golang built from master shown above\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\nIn looking at the sha3 implementation I noticed a difference in the alignment handling based on the target platform.  Having just made a similar change to crypo/cipher/xor.go, I recognized the same could be done here. \r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nN/A?\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nN/A?\r\n\r\nI have a change for this.\r\n\r\n",
