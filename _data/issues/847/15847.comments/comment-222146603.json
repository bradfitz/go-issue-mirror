As soon as this gets bigger then during the test there will be a pause at some moment when the GC runs automatically.\r\nWith lower count of items, the pause varies from 1-2 ms to 25 ms but it's within ok limits.\r\nFor me it looks like #9477 .\r\n\r\nSince the maps in this case are allocated once and the elements are not deleted then would it could we maybe get a way to track if the state is changed between GC runs so that this doesn't need to do anything during the STW phase? Something like: the GC computes the hash of the map while running the the parallel phase and in the STW phase it compares the hash from the previous one with the current one and if they are different they then it doesn't do anything for it?",
