	"body": "@dlsniper, just to be clear on the terminology, this issue isn't about the STW phase, it's about mutator availability. According to the gctrace, the STW phases are all sub-millisecond. If this is #9477, the problem is that the process of scanning a single object, even during concurrent marking, is currently non-interruptible on the particular thread it's running on. Other threads will continue to make progress, though they might also get caught up scanning large single objects. Of course, this is still a GC-caused latency problem; it's just not a problem in the STW phase. :)\r\n\r\nIt's not safe to exempt the map from GC. You would also have to exempt everything reachable from that map.\r\n\r\n@genez, great. I'll cook up a patch.",
