You might also need patch 2.\r\n\r\nIt's possible this is a scheduler issue where the one P that's running your one goroutine becomes a dedicated mark worker when GC starts and your goroutine winds up stuck on the run queue for the whole GC cycle. GOMAXPROCS=3 will eliminate that dedicated mark worker.",
