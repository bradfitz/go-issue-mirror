	"body": "I need a fake clock for testing which works reliably in concurrent situations. I am convinced, that the correct strategy is to advance the fake clock with checkdead(). Such an implementation of faketime is already completed and it is contained in runtime/proc.go and runtime/time.go. Unfortunately faketime is deactivated by default with no way to activate it.\r\n\r\nI am proposing a one-liner to activate the existing feature.\r\n```\r\n// Faketime activates the builtin fake clock and sets its current time in ns\r\nfunc Faketime(ns int64) {\r\n\tfaketime = ns\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy proposal as pull request:\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/pull/13787\r\n\r\nIf you guys have a way to pin this to test executions (go test ./...) it would perfectly work for me, too.",
