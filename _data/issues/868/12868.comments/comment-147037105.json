	"body": "@masiulaniec, good point. That's worth consideration. It doesn't quite work for the `Unsetenv` case, though. Unless we were to declare some magical value for the unset value (like `\"\\x00\"`, since `\"\"` is a valid value, and a NULL byte can't exist in environment variables). Little inconsistent with `os.Setenv` though.\r\n\r\nI'm increasingly thinking we should just call it `(*Cmd).MergeEnv(...)` in any case, so we can get the case right on `Env` and be allowed to set our own semantics instead of conforming to expectations of `os.Setenv`.",
