It's probably because it contains unexported fields an a new line before the public fields, but it would be nice if this empty is not shown. The same happens in the text version of the page: http://golang.org/pkg/sync/?m=text (manual scrolling required).\r\n\r\nContinued from https://github.com/golang/gddo/issues/243.",
