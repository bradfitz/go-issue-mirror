Currently it's:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc CopyFile(src, dst string, perm os.FileMode) error\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe rationale is that `dst` file eventually created by `CopyFile` should either inherit permissions from `src` file (the `cp -a` behaviour) or use default ones (`0777\u0026^umask`). If user wants to have different perm, he/she needs to use `os.Chmod` explicitely. We'd have then one less thing that `CopyFile` could fail on.",
