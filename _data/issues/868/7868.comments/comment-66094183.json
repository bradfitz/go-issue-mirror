Mine\nthoughts are:\n\nThere may be more, yet I immediately see two ways to think about where the clarification\nbelongs.\n\nIf the purpose of such clarification is to generally educate and explain concepts as\nwell as intricacies of the Go garbage collection process, then documenting it at the\nfunction level is wrong as far as I am concerned.\n\nOn the other hand, if the purpose is to set clear expectations of the specific function\nintended and side effects, then it seems to be a very Go thing to put it right there by\nthe function in the code. #amiright?\n\nThe depth of the clarification may reflect the chosen purpose.\u003c/pre\u003e",
