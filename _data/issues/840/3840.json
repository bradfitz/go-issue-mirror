	"body": "by **Frederik.Gruell**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI was trying to push go this night and found that you can overwrite the receiver in a\nmethod if the receiver is a pointer to a struct, but not if the receiver is a pointer to\na function. Could not find anything in the reference about it.\n\nExample: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/6C-7HURDXa\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/6C-7HURDXa\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Define a type that is a function:\n     type mapType func(int) (string, bool)\n2. Create a method that has a pointer to this type as the receiver\n     func (m *mapType) add(key int, val string) *mapType {\n3. Overwrite the receiver in the method body\n     *m = someOtherFunctionWithSameSignature\n\nWhat is the expected output? (see \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/6C-7HURDXa)\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/6C-7HURDXa)\u003c/a\u003e\n  p = (1, 2)\n  p swapped = (2, 1)\n  0: not found\n  1: not found\n  2: \u0026quot;two\u0026quot; found\n  3: \u0026quot;three\u0026quot; found\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n* in play.golang.org\n  p = (1, 2)\n  p swapped = (2, 1)\n  throw: out of memory (FixAlloc)\n\n  goroutine 1 [running]:\n\n* on my machine starts consuming memory and freezing the GUI until I desperately hit\nctrl-C\n  p = (1, 2)\n  p swapped = (2, 1)\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nopenSUSE 12.1 with factory packages for go\n# uname -a\nLinux gruell 3.1.10-1.16-desktop #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Jun 27 05:21:40 UTC 2012 (d016078)\nx86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.0.2\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nA working version with maps implemented with closures and disguised as OOP in an\nimmutable style can be found at \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/QoBCjjwhU1\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/QoBCjjwhU1\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
