If you've moved your Go install from the place you've\ncompiled it to somewhere else then you need to override the value of $GOROOT embedded\ninto the go tool to make things work.\n\nThe better tool for this is to use GOROOT_FINAL when compiling Go.\n\nIt's hard to get excited about this, the path prefix of the code is much less\ninteresting than the other contents of the panic message.\u003c/pre\u003e",
