	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Run program:\npackage main\n\nimport \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\n\nfunc main() {\n        var d int\n        for {\n                n, err := fmt.Scan(\u0026amp;d)\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\u0026quot;d: %v, n:%v, err:%v\\n\u0026quot;, d, n, err)\n        }\n}\n\n2. Input a non-integer\n3. Input EOF (ctrl-D)\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nSome differentiation between end of file and a format error.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nEnd of file and incorrect type of input cause identical results.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nUbuntu 11.04\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n2f0fa51fa2da weekly/weekly.2011-04-27\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nOften when reading from a file (os.Stdin is used here for simplicity), you iteratively\nread until you reach the end of the file. This isn't an error, so you should be able to\ndistinguish it from a normal error. Either by making the error os.EOF or nil, there\nshould be some way of telling the difference.\u003c/pre\u003e",
