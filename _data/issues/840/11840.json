	"body": "The help of the various Go subtools is mostly formatted to fit into 80 columns already. But there are a few exceptions, which makes the help messages hard to read.\r\n\r\nA patch is forthcoming which reformats these. I think it would be nice to get this into go1.5 if possible.\r\n\r\nPS: I know there's no expectation that Go code is always inside of 80 columns. But I think it would be a good idea for the output of \"go help XXX\" to fit inside normal sized windows.",
