It would be nice to make it possible for the linker's deadcode pass to catch exported symbols like Nl, Nd, etc. But: all of these tables are included in the unicode.Categories map, which is used by the regexp package.\r\n\r\nAll the real world programs I looked at use package regexp. Even tiny ones like objdump. So while this will make the \"hello world\" program from #6853 look good, I don't see how it will help in practice.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can convince me otherwise I'll dust this off, but for now this looks like an academic exercise to me.",
