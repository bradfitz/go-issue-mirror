	"body": "Overhead from too many init functions is a fair concern.  I'd imagine a lot of the functions could be compiled as nosplit, which might reduce the overhead.\r\n\r\nAlso, traditionally ELF compilers generate `.init` sections with straight line instructions that are just pasted together, skipping function call overhead for simple functions.  (The `.init` code still ends up forming a proper function because the linker will also include C runtime files like `crti.o` and `crtn.o`, which supply the appropriate function prologue/epilogue in their `.init` sections.)",
