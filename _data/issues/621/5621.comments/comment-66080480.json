I've debugged a similar one\nfor the preemptive scheduler.\nCarl, can you write some unit tests for that code? I think it's possible to call some\nfunctions and then call gentraceback with a custom callback that will dump where it sees\npointer, then check that it sees the pointers in correct locations (and only there). You\ncan see some runtime C tests if you search by runtimeÂ·testSchedLocalQueue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
