	"body": "[src/database/sql/driver/driver.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/database/sql/driver/driver.go#L13) says\r\n\u003e // Value is a value that drivers must be able to handle.\r\n\u003e // It is either nil or an instance of one of these types:\r\n\u003e //\r\n\u003e //   int64\r\n\u003e //   float64\r\n\u003e //   bool\r\n\u003e //   []byte\r\n\u003e //   string   [*] everywhere except from Rows.Next.\r\n\u003e //   time.Time\r\n\r\nand then [in the driver.Rows.Scan spec](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/database/sql/driver/driver.go#L164) it says:\r\n\u003e\t// The dest slice may be populated only with\r\n\u003e\t// a driver Value type, but excluding string.\r\n\u003e\t// All string values must be converted to []byte.\r\n\r\nBut in [sql.convertAssign](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/database/sql/convert.go#L86) which is called by [sql.Rows.Scan](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/database/sql/sql.go#L1838), it actually handles values of pretty much every type depending on the type the value is being scanned into.\r\n\r\nAccording to the spec, this fix for the go-sql-driver/mysql driver shouldn't work, but it does: https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/pull/434\r\n\r\nIt seems like the docs should be updated to reflect the actual behavior, or at least include all the types which are handled by [asString](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/database/sql/convert.go#L287) and [asBytes](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/database/sql/convert.go#L310) for values which are allowed to be returned from driver.Rows.Scan implementations.",
