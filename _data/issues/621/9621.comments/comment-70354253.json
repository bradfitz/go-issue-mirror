	"body": "No, the problem is that one of our `-X`-injected variables isn't getting set -- we're getting static binaries just fine (both the working and the non-working binary ends up static).\r\n\r\nWe inject three variables there: `dockerversion.VERSION`, `dockerversion.GITCOMMIT`, and `dockerversion.IAMSTATIC`.\r\n\r\nThe first two are set to strings, which as you can see from the `docker -v` output come through just fine in either case.  The one that doesn't is `dockerversion.IAMSTATIC` which is a `bool` that we set to `true` just to inform our daemon that it's a single-binary static build instead of a dual-binary dynamic build (with a pure-static smaller dockerinit binary, but that's not relevant here, it's just the context for what these variables are for -- the canonical way we build for our official releases is the single pure-static binary, which is where we're seeing the issue).",
