It's a big topic.\nWe do intend to add support for Unicode normalization\nso that programmers can explicitly normalize input\nstrings before comparisons.\n\nImplicit normalization is unlikely to happen.\nIn particular the Go input source is defined to not\ndo any normalization, so that \"\\u00E9\" != \"e\\u0301\"\neven though they happen to look the same (é é)\nThat's not likely to change, for the same reason\nthat \"\\u00b5\" != \"\\u03bc\" (μ µ) and 1.000000000001 != 1.0.\nThey only look the same at a superficial level.\n\nHaving normalization support will mean that programmers\nwho do want a different comparison can express that easily.\nBut we're not there yet.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **LongTerm**._",
