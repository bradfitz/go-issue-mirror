It would require a [Microsoft CLA](https://cla.microsoft.com/) if you don't have one yet (much like contributing to Go requires a Google CLA).\r\nAlternatively you can contribute your rc2 package to the x/crypto repo first and I'll follow with the pkcs12 package. I'd even prefer that, but I'm not sure how that works if rc2 is to be a subpackage of the pkcs12 package?",
