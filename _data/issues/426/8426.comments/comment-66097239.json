The following code \nshows the problem in milliseconds for me.\n\nfor {\n\t// replace 1.2.3.4 with a host that is down\n\t_, err := net.DialTimeout(\"tcp\", \"1.2.3.4:12345\", time.Second)\n\tif err == nil {\n\t\tpanic(\"Oops. We 'connected' to an non-existing host\")\n\t}\n}\n\n(NB. If the host is listening, or returns a RST, or you get ICMP Destination unreachable\nthen this may not show the problem.)\n\nIf the proposed CL is believed risky, can we consider reverting the change that\noriginally broke this?:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=5f662f12d550\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=5f662f12d550\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThat would at least get us back to 1.2 functionality.\u003c/pre\u003e",
