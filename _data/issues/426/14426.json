[This Go/cgo program](https://gist.github.com/opennota/7177aa08ecad0a384340), using ffmpeg via cgo, panics on line 72 at seemingly random timestamps / loop iterations given a path to an .mp4 video file as a first argument. You may need to run it several times to get a panic - about 50% of the runs are successful.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go version\r\ngo version go1.6 linux/amd64\r\n```",
