	"body": "Regarding the API, I would prefer to see the string parsing function decnum.FromString() match the rest of the Go API as decnum.Parse(). \r\n\r\nAlso, what is the need for both QuadToString() and the more idiomatic String()? In fact, I would again rather a more idiomatic Format() function for control over the precision being output.\r\n\r\nThere are other bloating aspects I don't quite understand, like the need for Copy(). The implementation and documentation equate to \"a = b\" so this function feels very unnecessary. Additionally, a native decimal128 type would be expected to use the assignment operator.\r\n\r\nI would argue that including a ToInt32/FromInt32 are also unnecessary. Generally, the standard library seems to prefer int64 and since converting to int32 is as simple as a type-cast I would request these functions be removed. I would also lump AppendQuad in with this list since append(slice, quad.Bytes()) is equally trivial.\r\n\r\nWhile perhaps just being nit-picky, I would remove DecNumMacros and DecNumVersion. I don't think they have any practical use in a Go API and they clutter up the docs by being there, providing a distraction.",
