All SQL databases implement such type natively for a reason, and it is quite unfortunate that there is no easy data type in Go in which we can store them.\r\n\r\nIf this type is in a third-party package, there can be a multiplication of choices, as is already the case for arbitrary-precision decimal, most of which are unfortunately experimental.\r\nIf it is in standard library, there will be no choosing, just one reference package with one API, and users and other packages can rely on it and be confident it works well.",
