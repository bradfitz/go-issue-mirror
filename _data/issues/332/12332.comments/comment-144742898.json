The two that come to mind immediately are (1) more exotic financial calculations, e.g., futures which might yield units like dollars-per-second or dollars-per-second-squared (e.g., derivatives etc) and (2) measurement units in general.  I think (2) is not a good idea partly because it's easy to construct dimensional castles in the sky that would bog down the currency use case, and because 34 decimal digits is not enough dynamic range -- measure the universe in Plancks, or weigh our galaxy in hydrogen atoms.\r\n\r\nIt might make sense to contemplate dimensioned numbers built by combining decimal numbers with units, and let numbers just be numbers.",
