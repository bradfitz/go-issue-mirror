You could write a program that converted the most negative integer to\nsyscall.Errno or syscall.Signal and then printed it.  That would cause the stack\noverflow, but it seems unlikely that a program would take a user input number and\nconvert to Errno or Signal.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **release-go1.4**._",
