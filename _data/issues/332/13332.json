	"body": "There is a constant stream (golang/lint#173, golang/lint#169, golang/lint#168, golang/lint#167, golang/lint#165 this list goes on and on) of user for golint that have outdated packages. This reports make it apparent that the `-u` flag of `go get` is kind of flawed. As the documentation for it states\r\n\r\n\u003e By default, get uses the network to check out missing packages but does not use it to look for updates to existing packages.\r\n\r\nThe wording \"by default\" would suggest that there is another flag which does update existing packages but it seems that this is still missing.\r\n\r\nI am happy to work on this, but would first like to discuss if this should be another flag, and if so, what its name should be.",
