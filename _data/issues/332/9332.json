	"body": "We upgraded to 1.4 recently and noticed dramatically higher memory usage when using the -race flag.\r\n\r\nThe following table is the memory usage expressed in virtual and resident (as seen in htop), with and without -race:\r\n\r\ngo    | race        | no-race\r\n-------|----|-----------------------\r\n1.4 | `2236M` / `36352` | `418M` / `8576`\r\n1.3.3 | `782M` / `24884` | `427M` / `8884`\r\n\r\nIs this a side-effect of converting them automatically from C to Go? (as seen in 59e3e5354d7fbb896022eb5bf57e8ad850c42dd1).\r\n\r\nWe noticed this because tests started running out of memory and failing. Looks like the overall footprint is just much higher with `-race` than in 1.3.3 (which was also higher, but not as bad).\r\n\r\n/cc @onsi @krishicks",
