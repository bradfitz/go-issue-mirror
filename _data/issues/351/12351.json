	"body": "I just remarked by reading the source of the [`strings.FieldsFunc`](http://golang.org/src/strings/strings.go?s=7834:7868#L321) that the method will also remove empty fields from its return value. For example, see the following [playground](http://play.golang.org/p/JbR62zX3en).\r\n\r\nSeeing that the used algorithm isn't the same than the one for the splits, I wonder if it is an undocumented feature or a bug ?",
