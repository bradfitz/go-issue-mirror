	"body": "I interpret Brad's ping to mean that this formal Proposal needs a Decision on whether or not to proceed.\r\n\r\nMy decision is to reject the proposal as is, for the reasons I gave earlier: I'd like to avoid incrementally adding a dozen odd SetThis and SetThat methods to the Window interface, one by one in an ad hoc manner, and instead I'd like a bigger picture design. I'd also like some more thought for how a cursor API would work (or not work) on mobile.\r\n\r\nI'm therefore closing this issue. Nonetheless, the ability to set a cursor is a legitimate feature request, albeit low priority, and probably lower the more prevalent touch screens become. Feel free to re-open the issue if you have an updated proposal that addresses those reasons for rejection.",
