It's not obvious to me that it's important for the go tool to try to defend against people who do this kind of thing.  You could do exactly the same thing by simply replacing the .a file.  Your proposed CL makes that a bit harder, because now I can't just replace the .a file using cp, I have to actually edit the .a file to change the build note value.\r\n\r\nCan you explain why this is worth changing?",
