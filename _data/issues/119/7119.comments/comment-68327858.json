	"body": "I've also found an issue with `cmd/godoc`, and I think it's very similar/related to this issue, so I'll add details here rather than creating a separate issue (is that the right thing to do?).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `cmd/godoc` will display (erroneously) docs/summary for things that are not a valid Go package, which can be misleading.\r\n\r\nFrom the help/description of `cmd/godoc`:\r\n\r\n\u003e Godoc extracts and generates documentation for Go programs.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e godoc fmt                # documentation for package fmt\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\r\nWhere \"package fmt\" implies to me the parameter should be a valid Go package.\r\n\r\nConsider these steps:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~ $ go get -d -u github.com/shurcooL/play/93\r\npackage github.com/shurcooL/play/93\r\n\timports github.com/shurcooL/play/93\r\n\timports github.com/shurcooL/play/93: no buildable Go source files in /tmp/tempgopath/src/github.com/shurcooL/play/93\r\n~ $ go list github.com/shurcooL/play/93\r\ncan't load package: package github.com/shurcooL/play/93: no buildable Go source files in /tmp/tempgopath/src/github.com/shurcooL/play/93\r\n~ $ go build github.com/shurcooL/play/93\r\ncan't load package: package github.com/shurcooL/play/93: no buildable Go source files in /tmp/tempgopath/src/github.com/shurcooL/play/93\r\n~ $ godoc github.com/shurcooL/play/93\r\nCOMMAND DOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\n    Package 93 is a test of \"package documentation\" functionality. It\r\n    contains a single .go file with package name documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n~ $ \r\n```\r\n\r\nClearly, `github.com/shurcooL/play/93` is not a valid Go package because it does not contain any .go files that are not ignored (it contains one, but it is ignored because the package name is `documentation`). `cmd/godoc` suggests it's a valid command, but it's not.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/golang/gddo/issues/225#issuecomment-68120540 for more details on why it happens.",
