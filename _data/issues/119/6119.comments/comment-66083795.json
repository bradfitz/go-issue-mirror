I instrumented the runtime to print out the big MSpans after each gc.\n\nWith GOMAXPROCS=1, there are only 3: one of 73728 pages (the main bucket table for the\nmap) and two with 19532 pages (the size of the big slice).  (I don't know why there are\n2 of the latter - shouldn't there be only one?)\n\nWith GOMAXPROCS=2, there are more.  There's still one 73728 one, but the number of 19532\nones keeps growing.  I get 3-4, then 7ish, then probably something bigger because it\ncrashes.\n\nI don't yet understand why maps, or why GOMAXPROCS matters.\u003c/pre\u003e",
