	"body": "I have a report from an OS X 10.11 El Capitan beta user that pprof works out of the box on that system, without the need for a kernel patch. I have also inspected the machine code for the relevant kernel function, and they did make changes roughly along the lines of what the patch has always done. So I believe it was intentionally fixed. I am hopeful that the fix will last into the final public release of OS X 10.11 El Capitan. And then maybe years from now we can look back and laugh at how ridiculous it was that we had to apply a binary patch to our kernels to profile our programs.\n\nDoes anyone know: is NetBSD still broken?",
