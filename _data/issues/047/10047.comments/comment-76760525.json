When that form is used, the variable is declared at the beginning of the implicit block in each clause.\"\r\n\r\nThe x mentioned in the short variable declaration is not yet in scope in case *x, and thus *x refers to the type x declared in an outer scope.\r\n\r\nWhile valid code, this is clearly not not the most readable way of writing this as it's definitively confusing at first.\r\n",
