You can\ncheck if you have that by typing 'python print 1\" at the gdb prompt.   If you have\npython support but for some reason you don't see the message \"Loading Go Runtime\nsupport\" , you can manually load it with\n   source /path/to/goroot/src/pkg/runtime/runtime-gdb.py\n\nThis runtime support only affects 'info goroutines' and pretty printing of slices, maps,\nchannels and interfaces; without runtime-gdb.py loaded you'll see them as their\nunderlying C structs and pointers.  Setting breakpoints and backtracing will still work.\n You can print the contents of strings by their -\u003estr field, and the data inside the\nslices is similarily visible by dereferencing -\u003edata (which gdb knows the right type of)\n\n\nCrashing or not appears to depend on GDB, version \u003e= 7.3 being compiled with thread\nsupport, and this is pretty likely a gdb internal bug in the breakpoint handling.  It\nappears that in some cases a workaround is to set a breakpoint somewhere (eg break\nmain.main) before running.\u003c/pre\u003e",
