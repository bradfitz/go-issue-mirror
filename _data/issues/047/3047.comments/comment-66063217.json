I was doing this because you mentioned the Go-specific\nextensions in that file might cause problems in comment 2.\nI did some more testing, and if I run GDB and at the beginning set a breakpoint on\n'main.main' then the program will run without crashing.  However, if at the beginning I\nset a breakpoint on 'fmt.Println' then GDB will crash.\nHowever, I have encountered another problem, when I set a breakpoint on line 30:\nfmt.Println(\" Claim number: \" +  strconv.Itoa(r.clmno))\n\nOnce the program gets to line 30, I cannot print the contents of r.clmno.  I tried\n\"print r\" and \"print r.clmno\" and both times GDB gave me the message \"No symbol r in the\ncurrent context\".  Is this a separate issue/bug?\u003c/pre\u003e",
