Paxmarked binaries works just fine with vanilla kernels.\nAlso, paxctl can both convert PT_GNU_STACK into PT_PAX_FLAGS (with -c option)\nand just add PT_PAX_FLAGS (with -C option).\nIn practice, only real difference between these was for skype binary (which has\nit's own protection against unauthorized modification of skype binary) - using\npaxctl -c will break skype protection, while using paxctl -C won't break it and so\nit's only way to paxmark skype.\u003c/pre\u003e",
