	"body": "**TL;DR** I'm trying to add some robustness to web service requests, but I find it very difficult to add this without an interface for `http.Client`.\r\n\r\n*To sketch the situation:*\r\n* [This](https://github.com/google/google-api-go-client/blob/master/translate/v2/translate-gen.go#L48) factory (google-api-go-client Translate) requires an `http.Client` as argument.\r\n* [This](https://github.com/sethgrid/pester) library wraps `http.Client` to provide all sorts of great features for adding robustness. \r\n* Because Go doesn't offer an interface type for `http.Client`, only concrete types can be used and thus there is no (sensible) way to use `pester.Client` even though it is a drop-in replacement for `http.Client`.\r\n\r\n*What I've done so far*\r\n* I've searched for an interface that can be used by the Translate SDK so that it can be changed to accept a custom concrete type, but I didn't find any.\r\n\r\nA related thread: https://github.com/google/google-api-go-client/issues/142#issuecomment-225371632",
