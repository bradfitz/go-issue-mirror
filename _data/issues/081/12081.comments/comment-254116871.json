Not finding any go source for this, I manage to create a working code based on @alexmullins code. Special thanks to you Sir 👍\r\n\r\nWhile it's not advisable to use Zip Standard Encryption for security reason, for those who have to work with it, you can check my code at https://github.com/yeka/zip\r\n\r\nI hope the awesome Go Team can integrate encryption into their standard zip/archive 😄 ",
