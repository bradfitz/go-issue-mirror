	"body": "by **joshlf13**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat does 'go version' print?\ngo version go1.2 linux/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nThe easiest problem to demonstrate is the nil-pointer dereference, so I'll give that as\nan example.\n\n1. Pass an expanded slice as the varargs to io.MultiReader or io.MultiWriter\n2. Set the first element of the slice to nil\n3. call Read([]byte{}) or Write([]byte{})\n\nExample on Go Playground: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/Xy4YMB8g4J\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/Xy4YMB8g4J\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat happened?\nnil pointer dereference\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\nnothing (method should have returned normally)\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI have a patch ready if people decide that this is a worthwhile thing to patch. My patch\ndeep-copies the varargs slice. Original discussion included a suggestion of simply\ndocumenting the behavior (golang-nuts thread:\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/forum/#\u003c/a\u003e!topic/golang-nuts/oZgkDyxqmfQ).\u003c/pre\u003e",
