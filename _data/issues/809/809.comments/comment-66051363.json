If this kind of interface\nconversion is permitted, one might argue that the assignment:\n\ntype X interface {\n\tfoo() struct{ x int }\n}\n\ntype S struct{ x int }\n\ntype T bool\nfunc (t T) foo() S {\n\treturn S{42}\n}\n\n...\nvar t T\nvar x X = t\n\nshould be legal on the grounds of \"asignment compatibility\". However, a fundamental\nassumption about how interfaces work is that the method's \nsignatures have to be identical.\n\nFurthermore, depending on the implementation, a conversion of the form X2(x1) as\nsuggested in the original issue report may require runtime work (to \npossibly re-map method tables).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **g...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Thinking**._",
