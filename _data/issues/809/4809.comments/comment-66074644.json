Can you, please, try\n\nhg clone -u go1.0.3 \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go\u003c/a\u003e go-exp\n\ncommand instead.\n\nhg clone \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go\u003c/a\u003e go-exp\n\ncommand will download \"latest\" version of exp packages - it is incompatible with your\nsource files (these are of version 1.0.3, as per your description). You want exp/...\nfiles as they were back then, when go 1.0.3 was released.\n\nAlternatively, if you already have go-exp directory, you could just do \"hg up -r\ngo1.0.3\", so you don't need to download everything again.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
