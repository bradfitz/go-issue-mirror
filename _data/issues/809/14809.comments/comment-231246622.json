	"body": "Interesting.  When the process hangs like this, it is waiting for `testprogcgo.exe CgoExternalThreadSignal crash` to exit.  That process should always exit within 5 seconds.  I don't know why it isn't.  If you can recreate this, then the next step is to run\r\n\r\n    GOTRACEBACK=system testprogcgo.exe CgoExternalThreadSIgnal crash\r\n\r\nin a loop.  Wait for it to hang--presumably it will eventually hang, otherwise I don't know what is going on.  Then press `^\\` to get a stack trace where it is hanging.  Thanks.",
