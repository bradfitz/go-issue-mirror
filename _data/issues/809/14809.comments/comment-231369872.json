	"body": "Thanks!\r\n\r\nYour program seems to be in a state where at least some uses of the `SYSCALL` instruction are raising a signal.  The effect seems to be an endless loop as the program tries to do something, makes a system call, and another signal is raised.  Unfortunately I don't know what that signal is or why it is occurring.  Based on the appearance of `sigpanic` in the call stack, I think the signal must be one of `SIGFPE`, `SIGBUS` or `SIGSEGV`, probably the latter.  But I can't think of any reason that a `SYSCALL` instruction would cause a `SIGSEGV`.",
