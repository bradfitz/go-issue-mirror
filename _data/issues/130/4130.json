	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThis is a placeholder issue for supporting linking against static libraries. There are\nplenty of good reasons to support it including more stable builds, fewer dependency\nissues outside of the go build system, and supporting projects that prefer to support\nstatic libraries instead of shared ones.\n\nThis came up again as the leveldb support for shared libraries has been pretty hit or\nmiss and they weren't too keen on supporting it in the first place.\u003c/pre\u003e",
