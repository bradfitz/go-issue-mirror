I was in c:\\rsc\\go\\src\\pkg\\runtime. I ran ...\n\nI can see your problem now. It is because of this logic in\n\u003ca href=\"http://tip.golang.org/src/cmd/go/build.go#L506\"\u003ehttp://tip.golang.org/src/cmd/go/build.go#L506\u003c/a\u003e. filepath.IsAbs(`\\x.go`) returns false\n(because the path does not have drive letter), so the code filepath.Join it with current\ndirectory. I think we should just call filepath.Abs here instead. Interestingly,\nfilepath.Abs has the same problem \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/8145\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/8145\u003c/a\u003e. I\npropose we fix filepath.Abs and use it in cmd/go. How does that sound to you?\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
