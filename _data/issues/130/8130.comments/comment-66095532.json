For example, if you computer has 2 drives c: and d:, which\nfile does \\x.go refer to? c:\\x.go or d:\\x.go?\n\n\\x.go is OK as relative path. Drive letter is part of \"current directory\", for example\n\nC:\\\u003ecd %GOROOT%\n\nC:\\go\\root\u003ecd\nC:\\go\\root\n\nC:\\go\\root\u003e\n\nSo, if my current directory is C:\\go\\root, then \\x.go would be referring to C:\\x.go.\n\nCould you, please, provide more details why you think we have a bug here. Thank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
