I agree we have to adjust these tests.\r\n\r\n\u003e Maybe parsing the whole output of netsh interface ipv4 show address could make the test more robust.\r\n\r\nI will try that.\r\n```\r\nnetsh interface ipv4 show address\r\n```\r\nfor ipv4, and\r\n```\r\nnetsh interface ipv6 show address level=verbose\r\n```\r\nfor ipv6.\r\n\r\n\u003e A simple fix would be (I could prepare a complete CL):\r\n\r\nYour proposed change looks good to me.\r\n\r\nI will write a CL when I have some time. If you want to do it yourself (or even half of it), feel free to do it.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nAlex",
