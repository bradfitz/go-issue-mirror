	"body": "Context: https://tour.golang.org/basics/4\r\n\r\nI was attempting to learn go during my morning commute on my iPad and found that my external keyboard does not work fully in the code input area - typing works and deleting work as expected, but the arrow keys do not move the cursor around.\r\n\r\nI tried this in both Safari and Chrome (which may or may not make a difference if it uses a webkit view under the hood) â€“ I'm not sure how to find out any more info from moblile Safari/Chrome as to what the error might be.\r\n\r\n(A normal text like this one on Github work with the arrow keys.)",
