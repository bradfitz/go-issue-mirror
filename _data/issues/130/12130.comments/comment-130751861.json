	"body": "@dooman87 I haven't looked into this in details but I have I have a suspicion: The error message mentions the same type \"golang.org/x/tools/go/types/typeutil.Hasher\" twice but they are not the same (according to the error).\r\n\r\nThis is a named type. The type-checker treats named types equal _only_ if they are represented by the same identical pointer. I suspect that you have two different representations for the same named type, in this case an imported type. An importer must be careful to always canonicalize named types so that the same named type imported via different imports results in always the same type data structure (i.e., the same pointer). This error can appear if you write your own custom-importer from scratch and don't to the canonicalization, or if you use the existing importers but don't provide the same import package map. I suspect the latter is the culprit.\r\n\r\nPlease check and update this issue. Thanks.",
