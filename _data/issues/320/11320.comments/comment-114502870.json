	"body": "Cputicks do not go backwards, they are unsynchronized on different CPUs. So you would need to create a pair of threads, bind them to every possible pair of CPUs and measure minimal roundtrip time as perceived by one CPU and by another CPU. And then figure out from that numbers if cputicks are unsynchronized. However, there can be various restrictions on binding of threads to CPUs; in such case kernel will silently ignore your affinity mask and bind the thread to something else. Here it is important to not end up with two threads bound to the same CPU, because otherwise round-trip will be determined by thread context switch time which is wrong. And, of course, syscalls for determining of affinity masks and actual binding are OS-specific. This is going to be messy.",
