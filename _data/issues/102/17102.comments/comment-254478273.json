Ok good to know.\r\n\r\ni see from the docs its called \"direct integration mode\" Which leads me to ask this side question:\r\ngomobile when building complete apps (not binding \u0026 not direct integration mode ), compiles into a NativeActivity as i understand it. Can one of these exposed http services locally and run as a daemon service ?\r\nOr can one use the \"direct integration mode\" to build local daemon / services that expose http services locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
