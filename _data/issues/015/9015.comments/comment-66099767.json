My guess about allp[0] was wrong but the conclusion was correct.\nIn fact 933d00+0x16a4 seems to be m0.p, which amounts to the same thing.\n\nFor what it's worth, when I cross compiled from Mac I got a binary with bss starting\nabout 0x300000 earlier.\nEven your binary's bss does not match the one on the builder (yours is 0x934d00 but the\nbuilder ix 0x933d00), but it's close enough to tell what's going on.\u003c/pre\u003e",
