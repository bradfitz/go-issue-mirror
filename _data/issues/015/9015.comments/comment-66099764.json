If you believe that starting point, the offending pointer\nis allp[0].runq.defer.fn.\n\nThis looks very much like it was fixed by \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/158750043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/158750043\u003c/a\u003e / hg\n3014f5ee3005.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Fixed**._",
