I tried using RegLoadMUIString on my windows 7 pc, but it fails with ERROR_INVALID_DATA. I will play some more.\r\n\r\nIf RegLoadMUIString does not work for me, perhaps we can do something similar to your code. We should also call ExpandString in case there are some environment variables to expand.\r\n\r\nFeel free to send change if you like. But no pressure, I will do it myself, if no one else wants to do it.\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n",
