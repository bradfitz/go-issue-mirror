	"body": "This is in continuation with https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13855\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use the `x/crypto/pkcs12` package's `Decode` method to read [this p12 file](https://github.com/golang/go/files/95892/Certificate.p12.zip) (public-certificate + private-key pair) with password `googler` to further generate a TLS certificate but get the following error:\r\n`pkcs12: expected exactly two safe bags in the PFX PDU`\r\n\r\nHere's how I'm reading the certificate file: `p12, err := ioutil.ReadFile(\"filename\")`\r\nand I'm passing the read binary data to `Decode(p12, \"password\")`\r\n\r\nI logged the number of safe bags returned from `getSafeContents` before line 219: `if len(bags) != 2 {` and it returned 4, which is why `Decode` is failing. Now I'm using `go1.6beta1 darwin/amd64` on OS X Yosemite version 10.10.5 (14F1509) and I generate the certificate by exporting both certificate and private key to a `.p12` as shown below:\r\n![screen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/853924/12419118/ffe1332a-bed9-11e5-923d-17b82bb325fc.jpg)\r\n\r\nI suspect the validation at line 219: `if len(bags) != 2 {` might be either incomplete or maybe I'm missing something. I've attached the certificate in question [here](https://github.com/golang/go/files/95892/Certificate.p12.zip) with password `googler` for testing...",
