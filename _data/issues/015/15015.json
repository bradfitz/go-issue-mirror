	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\ndarwin amd64 [os x]\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nSee https://github.com/elazarl/goproxy/issues/149\r\nBriefly- in a context of proxy server, I've sent a get request with an absolute URL without `Host` header:\r\n```\r\nGET http://bot.whatismyipaddress.com/ HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nHTTP Server should parse the `Host` from the URL\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nHTTP Server looked up for the `Host` header, instead of the request's host member(which is parsed):\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/http/server.go#L716\r\n\r\nThis line should be:\r\n```go\r\nhosts, haveHost := req.Host\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
