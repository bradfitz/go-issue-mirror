Certs end with 3 and keys end with 2 (see the oid* vars at the top of safebags.go).\r\n\r\n~~Could we consider changing Decode to return slices of certs/keys or an x509.CertPool? What is the API stability policy for x/crypto?~~\r\n\r\nFor a project I'm working on, I would like to include an intermediate certificate in the .p12 (2 certs, one private key). I'd prefer not to use ToPEM to Marshal keys if it's unnecessary.\r\n\r\n/cc @paulmey @AGWA\r\n",
