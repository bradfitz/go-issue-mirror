The x/crypto library isn't tied to a Go release, so once this issue is closed you will be able to just update x/crypto.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else wants to [contribute](https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html) a CL (change list), please don't wait for me.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Another consideration is whether to contribute to x/crypto at all, or just patch an independent repository. See https://github.com/Azure/go-pkcs12/issues/28.",
