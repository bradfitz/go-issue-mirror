It limits the amount of virtual\naddress space a program can use.\n\nGo's memory allocator reserves a lot of virtual\naddress space, to simplify its implementation,\nbut it does not use it all for 'hello, world'.\nI don't expect that to change.\n\nI can't explain why 32-bit and 64-bit Linux are\nbehaving differently for you.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
