This affects how the virtual real-time clock (RTC)\noperates and may be useful for Unix-like guest operating systems, which typically expect\nthe hardware clock to be set to UTC.\"\n\nAs mentioned by the reporter, I also removed the installation and pulled a fresh copy -\nno modifications.  \n\nBut, I continue to have the build error.\n\nAndrew mentioned in the google thread that its a timezone issue: \n\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/eeOHNw_shwU/hpoUb4OKUdEJ\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/eeOHNw_shwU/hpoUb4OKUdEJ\u003c/a\u003e\n\nAs I mentioned above, I am passing UTC bios clock to my VM, but the Debian install is\nset to EDT:\n\nspdev01:/usr/local$ date\nFri Sep 26 08:21:44 EDT 2014\n\nThanks!\u003c/pre\u003e",
