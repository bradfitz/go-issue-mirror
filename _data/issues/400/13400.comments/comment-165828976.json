I do not have code right now (because I decided to generate my SOAP requests throught text/template for the moment) but thet fact is, xml.Marshal generate tags w/o any namespace. I tried to use https://github.com/gabstv/go-soap (which use xml.Marshal) and even though there are \"xmlns:\" declaration for many tags, none of them are in the resulting XML file.
