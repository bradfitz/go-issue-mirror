Why isn't `Header.Add` allowed to modify the \"Host\" header? It's a regular HTTP\nheader like any other, so I've epxected it to work. Why doesn't it at least throw a\nruntime exception?\n\n2. Setting `req.Host = \"example.com\"` is ambiguous. It's not clear whether this changes\nthe actual hostname the connection is opened to, or just the \"Host\" header.\nExperimentation shows it's the latter, but that wasn't clear to me prior to\nexperimentation.\n\nI'm proposing the following fixes:\n\n1. Allow `Header.Add(\"Host\"...)` to change the \"Host\" header.\n\n2. Make it clear in Request.Host documentation that setting this value only changes the\n\"Host\" header but won't change the actual hostname/IP the connection will be opened to.\u003c/pre\u003e",
