That might turn into a major problem going forward though, assuming Go wants to support mobile development on iOS (which is I assume the intent of https://github.com/golang/mobile/).\r\n\r\nBitcode is part of the [new app thining](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html), and submission to the App Store for WatchOS apps must already be in bitcode. It's currently optional for iOS apps, but maybe it will be required for iOS 10 next year. I would bet that it is at most 2 years away. Apple has a long history of architecture transitions and they are typically quite aggressive as well.\r\n\r\nPS: What do you mean by the \"gc toolchain\"?",
