	"body": "Is this really an issue? How should `vcs.FromDir` handle git submodules inside git repositories?\r\n\r\nFrom https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/go/vcs#FromDir:\r\n\r\n\u003e FromDir inspects dir and its parents to determine the version control system and code repository to use. On return, root is the import path corresponding to the root of the repository.\r\n\r\nThe documentation doesn't make it explicit or clear, but I interpret that to mean that it will get the vcs that contains dir at the top-most level. So if you're inside a submodule directory of a git repo, it should still return the top level git repo, no?\r\n\r\nCan you link to the issue in `godep`, perhaps the issue is in how it's using `vcs.FromDir` and should be fixed there instead. It's hard to know without more details about the situation where it fails, so can you please elaborate on what you mean by \"a project that is imported as a git submodule\"?",
