	"body": "by **seharris**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n  1. In Emacs, run M-x gofmt RET\n  2. Type, say, \u0026quot;net\u0026quot;.\n  3. Observe the newly-created buffer with a name like \u0026quot;*godoc net*\u0026quot;.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n  The godoc buffer should behave more like an interactively-summoned\n  help buffer, obeying the view-mode paging commands.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n  The godoc buffer is presented in Fundamental mode and is modifiable,\n  which it should not be.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n  6g, though this problem is really about the Emacs go-mode software.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\n  Mac OS X 10.8.1\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\n  go1.0.2 (via MacPorts)\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\n  Attached please find a patch to present the documentation buffer\n  using view-mode, which feels more natural and polished to me.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/4322/0/go-mode.el.patch\"\u003ego-mode.el.patch\u003c/a\u003e (576 bytes)",
