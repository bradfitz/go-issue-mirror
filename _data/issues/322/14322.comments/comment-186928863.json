I'm just spouting nonsense, then.\r\n\r\nAs for a positive test, a quick read of my ubuntu box's /etc/services show that a positive test on all platforms won't be possible. It contains no services starting with a digit (although OS X got 43 of such entries). I suspect injection of entries on some platforms might make the test a bit too nasty. We could run the positive test on BSD and OS X, but it's still heavily dependent on user configuration, which is not very nice.\r\n\r\nAs for the test errors. the issue is that you're now accepting arbitrarily large ports, as you fall to lookupPort if the port wasn't ok (`(!ok \u0026\u0026 port != big \u0026\u0026 port != -big)`) *or* if it didn't consume everything (`consumed != len(service)`). That means that, if the port was invalid because the service was longer than a valid port, it'll call lookupPort instead of throwing and error with \"invalid port\".\r\n\r\nI guess the correct flow is either:\r\n* Look up service. If found, return\r\n* Convert to port number. If successful, return\r\n* Return error.\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n* Convert to port number. If successful and fully consumed, return\r\n* Look up service. If found, return\r\n* Return error.\r\n\r\nEdit: Removed super broken code snippet I had written at far too late. Sorry about that.",
