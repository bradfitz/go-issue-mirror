But with pe file, you could add sections after it is\nbuilt. So we can always creat tool that would add resources after. We could just use\nmake like before for these. We could write some sort of compiler that builds resources\nout of source files. It is hard for me to see the use case until I actually do something\nlike that.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
