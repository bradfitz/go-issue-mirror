Hard to see why we would need another one.  (Although when I wrote windres I\ndesigned it so that it could generate various different output formats, and that still\nseems to be true.)\n\nThis is another example of a tool like goyacc that generates an output file that should\nbe included in the program, although in this case the tool generates an object file\nrather than Go source code.  If we have a reasonable way to handle generated files, it\nshould handle this case too.\n\nIn the meantime, gathering all .o files into the link sounds a bit error-prone to me,\nbut we could use a different extension--.ogo?--or we could list them in a //build\ncomment.\u003c/pre\u003e",
