	"body": "I'd like to postpone handling this sort of, dual IP stack, issues to Go 1.6. The upcoming Go 1.5 contains @pmarks-net's Happy Eyeballs implementation and it could provide fairly better TCP connection setup than released versions on various environments such as IPv4-only, IPv6-only, dual IP stack w/o translation techniques or with XLAT, MAP-T or DS-lite, MAP-E-like translation techniques. Performance and connectivity improvements are desirable. But before doing that, I think we need to address issues in the real world carefully.\r\n\r\nRandom thoughts:\r\n- We don't need to consider 6to4 any more. See ~~https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520~~ https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7526\r\n- Both http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/v6ops/current/msg22275.html and http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/v6ops/current/msg22290.html threads are pretty interesting",
