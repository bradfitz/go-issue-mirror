	"body": "If I understand correctly RFC 6724 leaves issues on various site-specific implementations to site operators. If a site that implements DNS full service resolver stuff prefers IPv4 rather than IPv6, non-configurable address selection policy might annoy the site operator. For example, what if they use a plain-old DNS round-robin as a last resort? This sort of issue happens not only for an IPv6-to-IPv4 fallback case but for an IPv6-to-IPv6 fallback case; what if a node has multiple prefixes and one of the prefixes is not global routable?\r\n\r\nI agree on fixing this issue is necessary, and personally hope it comes with some interface for site operators.",
