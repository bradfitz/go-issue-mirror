What you're asking for is \n\n\tpackage time\n\t\n\t// SetLocal changes the current meaning of time.Local to match loc.\n\tfunc SetLocal(loc *Location)\n\nI don't believe this is a good idea. In general but especially in Go, coordination via global mutable state is almost always a mistake and difficult to correct once you realize it.\n\nIf there are higher-level APIs that force the use of time.Local, we should probably address those instead. For example, if package log is what you are concerned about, it would probably be okay to file a separate issue for adding log.SetLocation and log.(*Logger).SetLocation.",
