This might not be useful for services and system-to-system communication, but for the local system it is.\r\n\r\nEven the default log.Println() uses the local timezone to format the date, but it does not react on time zone changes, nor is it possible to force a re-read of the local time zone. (and the default log.Println() does not print any timezone offset to \"know\" what time zone it is using currently)\r\n",
