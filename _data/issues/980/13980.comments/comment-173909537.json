Current filapth.EvalSymlinks implementation does not rewrite those, while your version does.\r\n\r\nI expect `filepath.Rel` should work.\r\n\r\n\u003eAlso non-absolute paths on different drive from current will, probably, not work.\r\n\r\nI think carefully about this suggestion.\r\nI guess `Go` doesn't support such semantics specially.\r\nFrom my understanding, `cmd.exe` implements it as application level, not system level.\r\nIn system level (i.e. `CreateFile`), \"Z:foo/bar\" is not relative path, it depends.\r\nIf we are on Z drive, it is treated as relative path (same as \"./foo/bar\").\r\nIf not, it is treated as absolute path (same as \"Z:\\foo\\bar\").\r\n(Should I file a new issue for `filepath.IsAbs`?)\r\n\r\nThank you for your suggestions, you two!",
