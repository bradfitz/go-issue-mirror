So, these paths refer to the same file:\r\n\r\n\\\\this\\\\is\\\\my\\\\file\r\n/this/is/my/file\r\n/this\\\\is/my\\\\file\r\n\r\nExcuse me if that is a beaten topic and I am late to the discussion but maybe, instead of trusting in a plain string comparison or strings.EqualFold, what we need is a filepath function that, given two paths, returns true if they refer to the same file. In Unix that could be implemented with a simple string comparison, but in Windows it could have a more elaborated logic. ",
