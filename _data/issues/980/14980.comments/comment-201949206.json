It would be easy enough to run that again. Particularly if it's run on a multi-node system, any globals with poor cacheability or false sharing should stick out as expensive remote DRAM events.\r\n\r\nIt would also be easy enough to crank up the PEBS recording rate and just write a simple tool to look for hot globals. Sort of like https://godoc.org/github.com/aclements/go-perf/cmd/memanim, but obviously looking for different things in the memory trace. With memanim, I found the hardware could easily record every single load over 50 cycles.\r\n\r\nIf we do find any, the cheap solution is to add padding variables around them. We already do this in a few places (grep for CacheLineSize), but I think those are all based on assumptions about hot cache lines and aren't backed up by measurements.",
