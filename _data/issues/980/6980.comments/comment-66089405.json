Defers will need more care in the stack copier if they get\nstack-allocated, because the Defer chain will weave between allocated memory and the\nstack, but I think it is possible to make it work. (In contrast it was fundamentally not\npossible to make stack-allocated Panics work when they were also used during traceback,\nbecause a Panic near the bottom of the stack wasn't actually needed until later up the\nstack, and by then it had been rewritten. The CL 141490043 fixed this by not using\nPanics during traceback anymore.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
