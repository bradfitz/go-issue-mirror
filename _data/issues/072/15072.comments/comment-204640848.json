It doesn't support trybots, and doesn't have high network requirements, but it works for build.golang.org at least and we'll catch mistakes retroactively.\r\n\r\n2) for the new-style builder, it should run on a fast network connection and ideally be very elastic (run in the cloud somewhere) or have a lot of capacity so it doesn't become the slowest trybot builder.\r\n\r\nDoes Sun Solaris run on GCE or EC2?\r\n",
