Apologies if this is a duplicate.\r\n\r\nThe instructions at https://golang.org/doc/install/source say\r\n\r\n\u003e Go will install to a directory named go. Change to the directory that will be its parent and make sure the go directory does not exist. Then clone the repository and check out the latest release tag:\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e $ git clone https://go.googlesource.com/go\r\n\u003e $ cd go\r\n\u003e $ git checkout go1.4.1\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\r\nbut of course this is out of date and should be 1.4.2.\r\n\r\nIt would be even better if this could be updated automatically for new releases, or at least if there were some list of all references to be updated.",
