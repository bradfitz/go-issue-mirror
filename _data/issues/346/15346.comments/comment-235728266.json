People do so and usually integrate it with their editors and/or CI.\n3. At some point they generate code (or integrate a package that does) and\ngolint (and/or the other tools they may have also hooked up) start to\ncomplain. They see these complaints every time golint runs, which could be\nas often as every save.\n4. People roll their eyes at Go and golint.\n5. People stop using golint (and possibly other tools).\n\nSo, while I agree that golint should not be gospel or even run on generated\ncode, this is pretty common in my experience. It makes go look like a clown\nif it's own linter complains about code that an official package generates.\n\nOn Tue, Jul 26, 2016 at 11:24 PM Rob Pike \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\n\u003e I could imagine the linter deliberately ignoring generated code, which is\n\u003e usually easy to identify in good practice with the banner across the top.\n\u003e\n\u003e But I don't think that's the right answer.
