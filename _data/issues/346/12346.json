	"body": "This issue is a tracker for supporting additional GOOS/GOARCH shared objects than just `linux/amd64`.\r\n\r\nWhile packaging go1.5 for fedora, which has the goal/requirement of shared objects. This is a security and update-ability requirement and not something I intend to partially deploy for general consumption.\r\nInitially this target would be linux/386 and linux/arm, though arm64, etc would follow I'm sure.\r\n\r\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1256525 is the tracker for adding shared objects to the fedora golang rpms.\r\n\r\n/cc @mwhudson @ianlancetaylor ",
