Instead of 1.08 to 0.81 (-25%), it is 0.81\nto 0.74 (-10%).\n\nIt's hard to be sure that this is attributable directly to the unrolling and not to new\ncode alignment, but it does appear to help. And unrolling is good for reducing benchmark\noverhead anyway.\n\nThe question then is whether it's worth the ugliness to do by hand, in the short term.\u003c/pre\u003e",
