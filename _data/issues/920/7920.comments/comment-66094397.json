It's\npossible that what you are seeing is the effect of crossing instruction cache lines in a\ntight loop.  If that is indeed the case there isn't much the compiler or the testing\nframework can do, except serve as a cautionary tale for authors of microbenchmarks.\n\nOn the other hand, if the code changes, then there is probably a bug.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **release-go1.3maybe**._",
