As far as I\nremember, goroot/bin/tool directory works similar to $GOPATH/bin - \"native\" binaries go\nto   goroot/bin/tool or $GOPATH/bin, while any cross-compiled binaries go to\ngoroot/bin/tool/$GOOS_$GOARCH or $GOPATH/bin/$GOOS_$GOARCH.\n\nPerhaps the only change that we could do is to put both \"native\" and \"cross-compiled\"\nbinaries into goroot/bin/tool/$GOOS_$GOARCH making goroot/bin/tool directory structure\nmore uniform. But then the rule for goroot/bin/tool would be different from $GOPATH/bin.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
