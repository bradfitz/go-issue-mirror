This seems right to me, but might not be what you're specifically after.\r\n\r\nFrom the \"What did you expect to see?\" section it seems like you'd want it to load the first found `certFiles` entry and then load any certificates found in the `certDirectories` list?\r\n\r\nThis kind of feeds in to the comments on https://golang.org/cl/20253 regarding continuing to load `certDirectories` after loading `certFiles`.",
