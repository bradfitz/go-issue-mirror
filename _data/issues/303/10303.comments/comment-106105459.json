If someone wants to turn it into a patchset for tip I was too afraid to merge my new byValue function with cgoType and change cgoType, but it probably should just use cgoType instead. I'd be easily talked into giving it a shot though if this is a reasonable approach. \r\n\r\nIt'd also be worth writing a test for this behavior instead of my by-hand testing, but I wasn't sure the best way. Maybe put a bunch of stuff on the stack, call a C function with something from the middle of all the stack-allocated variable definitions, and make sure it's outside of that memory range?\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/jtolds/83a8cf059d496586709f",
