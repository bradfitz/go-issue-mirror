But I don't see why other parameters have to escape. I suspect we don't see the problem, because we don't use many windows syscalls that do callbacks. And the syscalls that do, perhaps, do not receive Go pointers as arguments. Maybe we just need to fix \"return values\" as described above.\r\n\r\nI will try to create a test that breaks as per your description. Thank you.\r\n\r\nAlex",
