Subdirectories contain other packages,\nwhich must be referred to by explicit import statements.\n\nIf you want the files in the subdirectories to be in different\npackages, add an import statement like\n\nimport \"bitbucket.org/mikespook/gearman-go/src/gearman/client\"\n(and change the files in client/*.go to say package client)\n\nand then refer to the pieces as client.Thing.\n\nIf you want the files in the subdirectories to be in the same\npackage as the parent directory, move them into the parent\ndirectory.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
