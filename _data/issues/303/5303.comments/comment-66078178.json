It would be fairly easy to modify the existing code so it can be\nincluded in the official crypto/x509 package since it already relies on a lot of\nunexported code from that package.\n\nIf there's interest, I can submit a CL after Go 1.2 has been released based on this code.\n\n[0] \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/jstemmer/pkcs10\"\u003ehttps://github.com/jstemmer/pkcs10\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
