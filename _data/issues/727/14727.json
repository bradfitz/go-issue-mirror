	"body": "As discussed in #12703, `x/tools/cmd/gotype` is deprecated since 1.6 and its replacement (`src/go/types/gotype.go`) is no longer go-gettable.\r\n\r\ngotype was very useful for interactive linters in text editors (see below). It is the only \"linter\" that picks up a certain class of errors (like misspelt keywords). Without it, these errors go unreported.\r\n\r\nUsing the compiler itself for inline linting is not ideal, as you generally don't want to generate artifacts. Additionally it may result in quite lengthy linting times under some circumstances (uncompiled dependencies).\r\n\r\nI could simply copy `gotype.go` into its own repository and go get that, but that has ongoing maintenance issues. I'd prefer not to do this.\r\n\r\nPlease consider making `gotype` go-gettable again. Thanks!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLinters using gotype:\r\n1. [Syntastic (VIM)](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic/blob/master/syntax_checkers/go/gotype.vim)\r\n2. [SublimeLinter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-gotype)\r\n3. [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/linter-gotype)\r\n\r\nAlso, any editor linter using [gometalinter](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter) also relies on this functionality, including [Emacs flycheck](https://github.com/favadi/flycheck-gometalinter) and many others.",
