Click on a package that is main\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nDocumentation for exported components.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nA blank page.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nMac OS X, Linux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\nGo1.1 (it worked in Go1.0)\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nOur company uses Go as our primary language, and we have been successfully for a year\nnow. All we really want is a command-line option in godoc to export main like it used to\ndo in Go1.\n\nThis is for internal reasons. We use it to distinguish finalized verses experimental\nfunctionality in our binaries, much like you would export something in a package to make\nit available for use. This was extremely helpful in our company Hackathon - we would\ncommunicate RPC calls to our iPhone developer without verbal communication. We got a lot\ndone. We've used this day to day, and it has helped a lot. Now we can't do this in Go\n1.1.\u003c/pre\u003e",
