Otherwise I'd rather not have to maintain a custom\nversion of godoc forever.\n\nAs an idea for the future version: Instead of a flag could be show a hyperlink on the\ncmd page that would allow you to view exported things anyway. There is an option to add\nm=all to the URL manually to show private things in a package. Would be nice if both\nthings were linked on the page cmd/package pages.\u003c/pre\u003e",
