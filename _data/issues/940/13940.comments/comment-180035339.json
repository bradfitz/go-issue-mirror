Putting it in an error message is slightly insulting to the user, whereas comments or method names in the compiler itself are less so.\r\n\r\n\"Overflowing shift\" or \"Shift beyond word length\" are both better ways of saying it (IMO), since they provide more information about what is stupid/ridiculous about the shift.\r\n",
