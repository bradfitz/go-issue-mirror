	"body": "\u003e Always linking to the godoc.org partially solves the problem if it is not private. I don't seriously care clicking on the links during the development. But this is a pain for private repos without a private deployment of godoc.org.\r\n\r\nI do, because I want to know if my links work ;)\r\n\r\n\u003e prefixed lists are pretty common in the godoc from the stdlib and official package. I think they look pretty ok. Why doesn't it work?\r\n\r\nI don't know (well I do, because lists in godoc aren't lists, they are paragraphs which need a blank line):\r\n\r\n```\r\n// This package is structured as follows:\r\n// - handler.go: A HTTP handler capable of validating access tokens.\r\n// - warden_http.go: A Go API using HTTP to validate access tokens.\r\n// - warden_local.go: A Go API using storage managers to validate access tokens.\r\n// - warden_test.go: Functional tests all of the above.\r\n```\r\n\r\n![lists](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3372410/17573777/e8143e9e-5f5c-11e6-9672-f5df4c3a3477.PNG)\r\n\r\n\u003e You can escape code if you indent in godoc. Like DoSometing at https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/context. Are you mentioning another type of inlining?\r\n\r\nYes, I'm talking about `this` type of inlining.",
