	"body": "I agree: package xml could use something like package json's ability to unmarshal into interface{}. What that is I'm not sure. I think a reasonable starting point would be something minimal like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// An Element represents the complete parse of a single XML element.\r\ntype Element struct {\r\n\tStartElement\r\n\tChild []Child\r\n}\r\n\r\n// A Child is an interface holding one of the element child types:\r\n// *Element, CharData, or Comment.\r\ntype Child interface{}\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure it makes sense to add all kinds of navigation help on top of this. The more specialized it is, the more likely it is to not work for a significant number of users.\r\n\r\nEdit: fixed s/\\*Node/\\*Element/ in the comment on Child.",
