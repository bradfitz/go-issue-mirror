I couldn't find anything in \"go help\nrun|build|install\" or \"go help gopath\" that indicated that:\n\n- \"go run/build\" _inside_ a workspace always uses the source .go files for dependencies\nif they are newer than the installed .a files, but\n- \"go run/build\" _outside_ a workspace only uses the installed .a files\u003c/pre\u003e",
