	"body": "by **fish@soundcloud.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIf you look up a not fully qualified name via net.Lookup* functions and the name can't\nbe resolved, it will print the name as it was a fully qualified name.\n\nGiven you have the search path \u0026quot;example.com\u0026quot; and try to resolve\n\u0026quot;foo\u0026quot;: If \u0026quot;foo.example.com\u0026quot; can't be resolved, net prints:\n\n        lookup foo.: no such host\n\nWhich is misleading because you expect it tried to resolve \u0026quot;foo.\u0026quot; where it in\nfact (as designed) tried to resolve \u0026quot;foo.example.com\u0026quot; as well.\n\nReason for this:\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/net/dnsclient_unix.go#208\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/net/dnsclient_unix.go#208\u003c/a\u003e makes the\nname fully qualified and the error will be returned right away. IMO it should use the\noriginally provided name for the error.\u003c/pre\u003e",
