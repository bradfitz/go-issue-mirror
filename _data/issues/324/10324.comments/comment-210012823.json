Is this supposed to be a joke? :open_mouth: \r\n\r\nVirtually all modern IDEs and code editors support the display of errors overlayed in the source editor, in the form of a line subrange (which means they need a start column, possibly an end column as well). For example, [Eclipse](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4324232/6976292/8f01c25c-d99f-11e4-9b35-db9d380d2bd3.png),  [IntelliJ](https://media.giphy.com/media/26tnf0cY2v2YTxbEY/giphy.gif), [Visual Studio Code](http://laumania.net/wp-content/uploads/VSCodeIntellisenseUnity3d1.png), [Atom](https://i.github-camo.com/426f984d5d32fc076680f2e9c0132c3144b3db43/687474703a2f2f65636f76652e6f6e2d7265762e636f6d2f6c696e7465722e676966), [Visual Studio](https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/dynimg/IC1020.gif) , and likely many others that I didn't bother searching for screenshots. I'm fairly sure even the ancient Vim and Emacs understand the concept of columns as well, with regards to error messages (although I didn't check).\r\n\r\nSo, if the implication is that all those IDEs and editors above are archaic, I'd really like to know what wonderful tool y'all are using to edit source code...",
