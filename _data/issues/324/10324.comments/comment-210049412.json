	"body": "@bruno-medeiros Regarding your question: Virtually nobody in the Go team uses an IDE which explains the lack of enthusiasm for more detailed position information. Don't take this as a value judgement, it's just a fact and a preference. We understand that a lot of people prefer to use some sort of IDE.\r\n\r\nThat said, as I have pointed out before, the go/ast provides full range information.\r\n\r\nThere is some not insignificant cost associated with tracking exact position information in a compiler, and the existing syntax tree in the compiler doesn't do it. There some significant engineering required to make it work correctly and reasonably efficiently. It may be done at some point, but it's not a high priority, hence the milestone of \"unplanned\".",
