I added the printing of the \"M\" and the last minute. Maybe that was mistake.\n\nThe real code looks more like this:\n\n// measure something\nfor {\n     // do something you can measure including I/O , system calls, CPU, network (lots of code here that calls out to other code) and count it\n     select {\n      case \u0026lt;-ticker.C:\n          m := snap_metric\u0026m)\n\t  stats \u0026lt;- calc_stats(m)\n       default:\n    }\n}\n\nIs this a valid idiom? I hope so, because it makes a vary nice way to collect metrics in\nGo. I get the feeling the answer is going to be no.\n\nI just want to point out that I am not trying to write infinite loops but rather collect\nmetrics at a certain rate.\n\nAlso, I am not trying to beat this to death. I thought I had a nice idiom for collecting\nmetrics but it's not clear that it is. So I am seeking some feedback.\u003c/pre\u003e",
