It does\nnot make sense to write an endless loop whose only element is a select statement with a\ndefault case.  I don't know what your program is trying to do.\n\nI know that your example is only a toy.  In the toy program, you should decide how often\nyou want to print an \"M\".  You shouldn't print one as often as possible--that is never\ngoing to make sense.  Even in the best possible case that is going to burn CPU time to\nno purpose.\n\nSo when you ask how you can rewrite the program to work properly when GOMAXPROC=1 I\nthink you need to define what \"work properly\" means.  If you are asking how to write a\nprogram that includes a CPU-burning endless loop but periodically interrupts the loop,\nthen I think the answer is that you need to periodically check for something else within\nthe loop.  What you should check for depends on how your program is supposed to work.\n\nTo put it another way, you are writing as though the endless loop is some low priority\noperation that should only happen if there is nothing else to do.  But Go doesn't work\nthat way--it doesn't provide a facility to do something only when there is nothing else\nto do.  A more appropriate way to look at your program is that you have an endless loop,\nand you want to check other things every so often.  When do you want to check them, and\nwhat do you want to do?\u003c/pre\u003e",
