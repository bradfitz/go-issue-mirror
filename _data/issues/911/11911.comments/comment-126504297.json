We're not supposed to be sweeping *any* spans (and usually we don't). This suggests that some accounting is off and it's throwing off both the sweep ratio and the assist ratio. This sweeping is also bad for the mutator yielding trick because mutators that are allocating wind up yielding a lot during this sweep process.",
