	"body": "@RLH and I discussed and the plan is to set a flag to indicate when we want to be GCing, but can't have mutator assists enabled (because we're either just starting or just finishing GC), and make the mutator goroutine yield if it would otherwise assist. This means 1) from when we surpass the heap trigger and ready the GC goroutine to just after the first stop-the-world, and 2) from just before the last start-the-world to right before the GC goroutine parks.\r\n\r\nA more aggressive form of this is to have the mutator repeatedly yield until the GC says it's ready, but we're worried that might be too risky at this point.\r\n\r\nI think there are other causes mixed in with this, but we'll see if this mitigates at least part of the problem.\r\n\r\nI'm writing a Go1.6Early issue about ways to fix this more properly.",
