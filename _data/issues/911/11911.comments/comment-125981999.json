	"body": "It looks like the start of GC is being delayed sometimes. The jumps in RSS correspond to large heap sizes at the *start* of a GC cycle (well beyond the heap trigger) and these cycles tend to start much longer after the previous cycle than normal (~500ms instead of ~150ms). We successfully collect back to ~100 MB (plus a little for floating garbage), but the memory doesn't get returned to the system because the scavenger is conservative (and may never get returned if these bumps keep happening).\r\n\r\n@RLH is adding instrumentation to pin down exactly where the delay happens.",
