The 352ms I saw before could actually have been this (my tracing wasn't high enough fidelity to separate them). I am *also* seeing that it sometimes takes a long time to acquire worldsema (33ms, 40ms).\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem is *not* that there are unswept spans at this point. Even when we take a long time to get through the loop, we don't actually execute any iterations of the loop. The time is spent in the single call to gosweepone(), which ultimately returns -1.",
