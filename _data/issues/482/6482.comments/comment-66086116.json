This is hardly an edge\ncondition.\n\nThis is such a severe problem that it will prevent many serious Go users from upgrading. \n\nFrom where I stand, the additional precision is meaningless if it increases GC time 9x.\nWith 1.1.x the VM grows to about 2x resident, but the resident stays fairly constant,\nand the VM doesn't appear to grow without bounds. Not ideal, but a mild problem compared\nto a 9x increase in GC time.\u003c/pre\u003e",
