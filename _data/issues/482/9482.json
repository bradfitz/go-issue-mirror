	"body": "Given a libgojni.so that is loaded via `Go.init(this)` in `Application` class can cause regular app errors to not print to logcat.\r\n\r\nI've seen this behavior using the v7 RecyclerView and not setting a layout manager which would normally print an error to logcat and exit. Instead, the go runtime starts and is followed by a WIN DEATH and nothing is printed in regards to the RecyclerView error.\r\n\r\nDisabling `Go.init(this)` and any other related Go code will allow the error to print to logcat.\r\n\r\nI can put together a minimal sample upon request if the above is not clear enough.",
