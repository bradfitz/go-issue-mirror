Maybe you\nare not familiar with many sorting algorithms. A merge sort can work very efficiently on\nlinked lists; in fact, it can even sort tape drives efficiently:\n\u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort#Merge_sort_using_tape_drives\"\u003ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort#Merge_sort_using_tape_drives\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe C++ standard has a list class (doubly-linked list), which has a .sort() method,\nwhich is guaranteed by the standard to run in O(n log n) time.\u003c/pre\u003e",
