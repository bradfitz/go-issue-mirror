But right now it's cutting 40% of the runtime for\nthe api check, so I'd like to keep it.\n\nI have not checked, but I think maybe this would go away if there were build tags\npresent for all possible architectures instead of amd64. The all possible thing is much\nmore common: you have one file for amd64, one for 386, one for arm. Maybe there's\noverlap but you basically never have one for amd64 and nothing for 386/arm, or else\nyou'd have an incomplete package on those. That can happen in external code maybe but\nnot in the standard library. Because of that theory, it is possible that we will never\nsee this in a real standard library package.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
