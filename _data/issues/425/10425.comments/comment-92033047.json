Inside the if-else, *trueVal* and *falseVal* sounds like some pre-calculated values, which doesn't respect the definition of ternary operator.\r\n\r\nIt should be something like:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nif expr {\r\n    trueExpr\r\n} else {\r\n    falseExpr\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, correct me please If I'm wrong.",
