For one, there is no guarantee that\r\nfuture OS X won't move sysctl to /sbin or even\r\n/usr/bin.\r\n\r\nActually, I think a better solution for Gentoo/Alt\r\nis to just define GOHOSTARCH before running\r\nmake.bash. Portage knows very well what arch\r\nthe host is on, so auto-detection in cmd/dist is\r\nunnecessary.\r\n(That is, I think we can make cmd/dist skip the\r\nsysctl run if $GOHOSTARCH is defined.)\r\n",
