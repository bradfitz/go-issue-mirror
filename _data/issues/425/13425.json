	"body": "On Darwin, it appears that the method of determining whether default GOHOSTARCH setting should be amd64 relies on sysctl. There are use cases where sysctl is not in the users' path. In situations like this, the OSx build of go will break.\r\n\r\nFor an example, see https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=558368.\r\n\r\nThe suggested patch for that bug is to hard code the path to /usr/sbin/sysctl in the command.\r\n\r\nBefore I do that, I'm wondering if you are interested in doing so upstream, or if there is a better way to do this autodetection on OSx?\r\n\r\nThanks much,\r\n\r\nWilliam\r\n",
