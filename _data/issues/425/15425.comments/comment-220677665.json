It's one of those things that while trying to find the bug I modified a bunch of different values - but didn't work backwards to really isolate what caused the issue.\r\n\r\nThis script uses much less memory, but reliably (on my system) fails. (Smaller values can succeed sometimes). https://gist.github.com/nemothekid/fad888179a061a0e3cd80d191a407b9f\r\n\r\nThe reason I have it loop is because I think the issue is racy. I'm going to continue to see if I can further isolate the issue.",
