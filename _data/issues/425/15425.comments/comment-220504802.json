There is an issue with the go http2 server that prevents https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15425#issuecomment-214859826 from being served correctly.\r\n2. There is also an issue with Chrome (reported before me at 603182 in their tracker) that prevents the Chrome from treating `RST_STREAM` correctly.\r\n\r\nPoint 2. can only be fixed in Chrome (the issue was brought up by the nginx team). Here is a script using httptest.NewServer that reproduces point 1. https://gist.github.com/nemothekid/35a3edcf332a20225c725696c0e40e70 Note that the request should succeed, but currently fails.\r\n\r\nA possible work around I developed as to never close the underlying pipe in `requestBody` (https://github.com/nemothekid/net/commit/ad5c348a11fea28fb343036919761dde625f06d4) but I'm not sure what else this breaks/leaks or if this is an \"optimal\" solution.",
