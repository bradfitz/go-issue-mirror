(Smaller values can succeed sometimes). https://gist.github.com/nemothekid/fad888179a061a0e3cd80d191a407b9f\r\n\r\nI think you pasted the wrong file. That has tiny values and seems to work all the time.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a script which reliably fails. Make the loop iteration count high enough to make it eventually fail (not 2, more like 1000 or whatever). And make the script fail with log.Fatal when the behavior isn't as expected. That is, check the result of io.Copy, and don't just log it.\r\n\r\n",
