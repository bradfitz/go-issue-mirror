	"body": "In my code, nothing is infinite. I wrapped all the infinite readers in LimitReaders. But this way the program doesn't consume gigabytes of RAM and crash due to my dev VM's small size.\r\n\r\nI'm a little confused by your analysis still. What would be most helpful if I'm going to be able to fix this in the next few hours is if you can provide a version of your repro which doesn't allocate 2GB of memory and still demonstrates the problem.\r\n\r\nMake it loop more than 2 times, and have it crash if it gets an unexpected result, making it clear in the failure message or code what it's expecting.\r\n\r\nThat is, I want to see the high level use case fail. I can diagnose the HTTP/2-level problems.\r\n\r\nBut it's hard for me to work the other way, with speculation on the HTTP/2-level problem and trying to guess the use case.\r\n\r\nIf you can comment on whether my patch above makes this better or worse (or completely fixes your case), that would be great too.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
