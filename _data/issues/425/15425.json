	"body": "**1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?** `go version go1.6 darwin/amd64`\r\n\r\n**2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?** `OS X El Capitan 10.11.1`\r\n```\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"darwin\"\r\nGOOS=\"darwin\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/Users/nimi/go\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6/libexec\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.6/libexec/pkg/tool/darwin_amd64\"\r\nGO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=\"1\"\r\nCC=\"clang\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fno-caret-diagnostics -Qunused-arguments -fmessage-length=0 -fno-common\"\r\nCXX=\"clang++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**3. What did you do?**\r\n\r\nInitiate a POST request with a large body. Ignore the request (and/or also Close the request body). The golang http/2 server will **not** send the response body back to the client. In cases where the request Body is closed, Chrome and other browsers get an error in the connection (`net::ERR_SPDY_PROTOCOL_ERROR`)\r\n\r\nSee https://gist.github.com/nemothekid/c20921999d1cce1b3c982d035d6b09b5\r\n\r\nThis program will server a javascript application that will try to issue a POST request with some data to the server. When run, the POST request will fail.\r\n\r\n**4. What did you expect to see?**\r\n\r\nPOST request should succeed, the browser should be able to retrieve the server's message body.\r\n\r\n**5. What did you see instead?**\r\n\r\nThe POST request fails, and the body is never sent by the server. The works fine in HTTP/1.1 (Tested with `GODEBUG=http2server=0`). I discovered this issue while trying to debug mholt/caddy#782, where an upstream proxy server was rejecting the body. Also this issue would occur on servers that decide to refuse a payload above a specific size and need to respond with a sensible error message.",
