If they would exist, we've most likely\nnoticed them already.\nAs 0xjnml said, pthread/C/Java primitives are designed for very different environment\nand programming model.\n\nI can imagine a rare case for only trylocked mutex along the lines of:\n\nfor ... {\n  // do something local\n  if atomic.SwapUint32(\u0026merger, 1) == 0 {\n    // merge local results into global results\n    atomic.StoreUint32(\u0026merger, 0)\n  }\n}\n\nBut this is easily solved with atomic operations.\n\nAs for TimedLock, mutex is the very wrong level to solve priorities/deadlines/timeouts.\n\n#WontFix\u003c/pre\u003e",
