My question was directly about TryLock, and you responded with arguments for\nLockBefore.\n2. Every feature is useful. If it wasn't useful, we wouldn't be talking about it. Go is\nrespected both for what it provides, and also for what it leaves out. It doesn't matter\nif the feature is easy to implement. Often \"it is easy to do\" is a very bad reason to\nadd features.\n\nThis is not me arguing against TryLock. I have no strong opinion one way or another.\nRather, I am trying to find the argument *for* TryLock.\u003c/pre\u003e",
