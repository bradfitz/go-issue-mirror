	"body": "Your program uses cgo. I wasn't sure if `stringer` officially supported use of cgo or not.\r\n\r\nI looked at the source code and I didn't see any \"TODO\" or similar mentions regarding importing package \"C\", so it seems it _might_ be supported. The .go files that import \"C\" are indeed processed (e.g., see [here](http://gotools.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer?rev=823804e1ae08dbb14eb807afc7db9993bc9e3cc3#stringer-go-L202)), but that's the only special thing being done.\r\n\r\nI guess my point is that it should first be confirmed that the tool is meant to support cgo at this time. If so, this is likely a problem with it (since I imagine it's a situation that's less common and therefore more poorly tested).",
