	"body": "stringer doesn't support cgo.  It makes the simplifying assumptions that the initial package consists only of Go source files and that dependencies can be loaded from compiler export data (e.g. $GOROOT/pkg/$GOOS_$GOARCH/fmt.a).\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\nThis issue is more or less a duplicate of \"stringer: can't find packages\" (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10249).  Josh closed it and filed the broader issue \"go/loader: importers should just work\" (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10276).  I closed that after some changes to go/loader; in passing, I created a CL to make stringer use go/loader (https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/8561/) but it was rejected by Rob \"until go/loader is tidied up\".  go/loader could use more tidying up, though I won't be able to get to this for a while.  In the meantime, stringer still has this bug.",
