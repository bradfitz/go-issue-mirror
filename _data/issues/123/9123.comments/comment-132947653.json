	"body": "@davecheney Thanks for responding to my slowdown issue. I'm going to do some profiling too. I'll profile both the 1.4.2 and 1.5 generated program code. I try to find out the differences between the two. Fortunately, I can reproduce this issue on every run.\r\nI hope I can install both 1.4.2 and 1.5 on the same computer (Windows 7 x64) at the same time...\r\nI'll try to send you an update soon.",
