	"body": "\u003e I haven't done performance tests for Docker binaries, but that is probably going to be slower as well because Docker has quite a bit of code. This might mean waiting for Go 1.6 and skipping Go 1.5.\r\n\r\nPlease test and profile to confirm if this is the case. Your make unit-test slowdown looks unexpected. 10m vs 1m30 sounds like a lot more work is being done before the tests start.\r\n\r\n\u003e Go tip didn't seem to have these issues a few months ago.\r\n\u003e Are there any plans to address some of these issues in Go 1.5.x?\r\n\r\nyes, please log an issue with details of what you are seeing and how to reproduce the issue.",
