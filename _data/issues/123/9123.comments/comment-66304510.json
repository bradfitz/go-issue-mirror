It might also have something to do with memory allocations.\r\nThe amount of allocated memory has grown 4 times from Go 1.3.3 for a benchmark which was using bytes.Buffer.\r\n\r\nOther tests and programs have also taken a 20-33% performance hit which might be connected to goroutines, channels and memory allocations.\r\n\r\nThis makes Go even slower, burdens the garbage collector with more garbage and increases memory usage for everything using Go.",
