	"body": "Let's change this to follow the proposal process. I've done some more hacking and have a branch (https://github.com/mwhudson/go/tree/symbol-table-2) that uses an ad-hoc format and makes linking godoc about 30% faster, reduces linker memory consumption by about 10% and has negligible effect on the compiler runtime or memory usage.\r\n\r\nThis seems like enough to me to make the effort of changing format worthwhile. An open question is whether to use a more established format like ELF or macho or PE (the formats Go has general support for; I only really understand ELF of these) or something more tailored to Go's needs.  The main advantage of using a standard format that I can see would be being able to use standard tools to inspect them, which would be nice but not super compelling. Maybe I'm missing something else though.",
