	"body": "In the `http` package `Error` displays just an error message. When building a web application you will often want to have style error pages matching the site or application. In order to get this with Go you need to implement your own `Error` handling along with any code that calls it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want custom error pages (including 404 not found pages) and want to serve files you need to bypass the built in file server and re-implement much of it to change the error page handling.\r\n\r\nIt would be far simpler to allow the `Error` to provide a default but be capable of being replaced.",
