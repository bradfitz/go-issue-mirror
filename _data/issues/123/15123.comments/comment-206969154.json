In my implementation, I used two\r\ntechniques:\r\n\r\n1. (for MySQL \u003c 5.7.8) [KILL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/kill.html) by another connection.\r\n2. (for MySQL \u003e= 5.7.8) [SET max_execution_time](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_execution_time).\r\n\r\nThis was possible because I knew my program issues only SELECT statements.\r\n\r\nFrom this experience, I'm not sure whether it is good or not that database drivers\r\nimplicitly executes this kind of queries with side effects for native support of contexts.\r\n\r\nThe code is here for your reference:\r\nhttps://github.com/cybozu-go/goma/blob/ac585a21752104d5ce69601c310eed753bf8f135/probes/mysql/probe.go#L27",
