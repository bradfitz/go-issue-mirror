	"body": "@kardianos I think using a interface is overkill. For vendor specific settings, you will need to import the driver expicitly (not just register with a '_') anyway. So for more complex transaction settings, driver could provide helper functions like: `func SetTxXXX(tx *sql.Tx) error`, which just call `tx.Exec(\"SET TRANSACTION ...\")` under the hood. It is just that if you are adding a flag like argument to `BeginContext()` to support isolation level and access mode etc, we could make it a little more generic by making it a `flags uint32`, which could both use with stblib defined or driver specific flags without much overhead.\r\n\r\nAnd I still want to ask the reason to put `IsoSnapshot` behind `IsoSerializable`. MSSQL's wire protocol MS-TDS seems to use [the same ordering](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd339887.aspx). But I think that is just because `Snapshot` for them is added after, so they can't change the ordering for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nAlso the encoding of the Isolation constants could be more efficiently, as different isolation levels can't be used together.",
