	"body": "@kardianos I said that above, it can be done with a `func SetTxXXX(tx *sql.Tx) error` in driver. Because this is too driver specific, no need to specially support that in the stdlib. I want the constants to be extendable because there is already a uint32 or byte like argument in your proposal, better make it more extendable. It is more about api design than just user requirement.\r\n\r\nFor predefined constants, it could be like:\r\n```go\r\nconst (\r\n    DefaultTx iota\r\n\r\n    // isolation level, 3bits\r\n    // Warning: The actual meanings of these levels are drive defined, use with cautious\r\n    ReadUncommitedTx\r\n    ReadCommitedTx\r\n    WriteCommitedTx\r\n    RepeatableReadTx\r\n    SnapshotTx\r\n    SerializableTx\r\n    LinearizableTx\r\n\r\n    // access mode, 2bits\r\n    ReadOnlyTx    0x1000\r\n    WriteOnlyTx   0x10000\r\n    ReadWriteTx   0x11000\r\n\r\n    // remaining bits are for custom driver defined flags\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nWriteCommited probably shouldn't exsist, so remove it from the above list.",
