	"body": "Instead of the new methods on *Stmt and *Transaction, why not add a `PrepareWithContext(ctx context.Context, query string) (*Stmt, error)` and BeginWithContext(ctx context.Context) (*Tx, error)` to *DB? Internally those would set a `Context context.Context` field and if that's != nil then it would be used in the right places. It's strange to me (not sure why) that I would/could inject different contexts at different points for both prepared statements and transactions. I'm sure I'm just missing something?",
