	"body": "CL 19003 is kind of stupid.\nIt's left over from when a .c file could be intended for cgo or for the Go (Plan 9) C compiler.\nThe Plan 9 C compiler was removed in Go 1.5 and stayed removed in Go 1.6\n(not that there was any doubt).\nFor Go 1.7 we could consider assuming that .c files are for cgo and remove the logic in the go command that considers they might be for the Plan 9 C compiler. Two releases is likely long enough to get people with Plan 9 C files to convert, if there were any people to begin with.\n\n/cc @bradfitz @robpike",
