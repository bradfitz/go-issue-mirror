I made a change in 1.4 that removed a lot of these 2 (or for arm, 3) word pushes/pops for defers and go statements.  Maybe traceback doesn't understand this 2-word pad?  Maybe the pcsp map no longer contains the sp delta for this _div callsite?\r\n\r\nMaybe we can just get rid of the 2-word push/pop?  I don't see what its purpose is.",
