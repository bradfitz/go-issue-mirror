I think the tide is slowly turning\naway from indices. It is true that\n\u003ca href=\"http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/index\"\u003ehttp://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/index\u003c/a\u003e says that\nindices occurs \"especially in technical use\" but I think that is\nsaying \"if you see indices you're likely to be reading technical\nmaterial\" not \"if you're reading technical material you're likely to\nsee indices\". Especially since we've already got the doc saying\nIndexes and since Indexes matches when you're doing a text search for\nIndex, I would keep Indexes.\u003c/pre\u003e",
