I can now\nsee that I can achieve exactly what I want to do with the API as is stands at the\nmoment. Apologies for confusion.\n\nTo explain, the current gzip.Reader Read() method returns with a nil error without\nfilling the parameter slice when the call to z.decompressor.Read(p) reads across a\nmember boundary (because err != io.EOF since the decompressor return nil here). In my\ncase I intend to already know the start of the next member, so a gzip.Reader Reset() on\nthe underlying Reader Seek'd to the appropriate location will give me the next Header.\n\nThe upshot is that a test of n \u0026lt; len(p) \u0026\u0026 err == nil will tell you if you have\nreached a boundary. \n\nAfter a brief reading of the WARC format mentioned by Daniel Krech in the original\nthread, I think they should also be able to use this approach.\u003c/pre\u003e",
