	"body": "by **robert.hencke**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIt's always felt strange to me that misc/cgo seemed to evolve to serve two purposes: a\nset of usage samples, and a suite of tests that are a core part of the build process.\n\nI think of the misc directory as being an assortment of files that are potentially\nuseful, but not required, for Go development.  I think that's what nags me about\nimportant cgo tests being in there... it felt like it was originally chosen as a\nconvenient place for the tests because there was already some cgo programs in there, and\nthen just kind of spiraled to be a mishmash of tests and samples.\n\nI don't have a better idea for where the tests would go, and I'm not trying to bikeshed.\nIf I am alone in feeling this way, please feel free to close as\nwontfix/workingasintended.\u003c/pre\u003e",
