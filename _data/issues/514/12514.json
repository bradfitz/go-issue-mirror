	"body": "Hello.\r\nI am using gomobile in Windows System.\r\nWhen build the example named \"Audio\",it is successful.Howevery,when run it on the Genymotion virtual device and a true Android device, the application is crashed the same.\r\nAfter the debug, something I found:\r\n* I can find the error message from logcat, it show this: \r\n``` \r\nI/GoLog   ( 9589): al: cannot load libopenal.so \r\n```\r\n* Additionally, I try to delete code line, then I am sure this code (in onStart function) throw this error:\r\n``` \r\nrc, err := asset.Open(\"boing.wav\") \r\n````\r\nIs someone get the same error when running the example of \"Audio\" ?\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI am not sure is this the issues from gomobile,or other reason? \r\nHowever, as a new developer who use gomobile to build android apps,I read the document from:\r\nhttps://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/example/audio\r\nIt tell me just  to use \"gomobile build\".\r\nAdditionally, I notice the message about:\r\n``` \r\nOn Linux, you need to install OpenAL developer library by running the command below. \r\n$ apt-get install libopenal-dev\r\n```\r\nHowever, on Windows, do I need to do something  similarly?\r\nIf the GoDoc could write down it  more clearly, we walked some detours can be avoided. :)\r\n\r\n---------\r\nI am using the newest gomobile package and keep to update everyday.\r\nSo everything is newest when this problem was happended.\r\nThank you sincerely.\r\n",
