They really have no\nname, because you can't normally reach them.\n\nAnd you say that the field is anonymous b/c it has no name, yet, specification gives an\nexample of anonymous fields conflicting because of their names.\n\n\"The following declaration is illegal because field names must be unique in a struct\ntype:\n\nstruct {\n\tT     // conflicts with anonymous field *T and *P.T\n\t*T    // conflicts with anonymous field T and *P.T\n\t*P.T  // conflicts with anonymous field T and *T\n}\"\n\nWhat we're talking about here is the definition of terminology confusion. :)\u003c/pre\u003e",
