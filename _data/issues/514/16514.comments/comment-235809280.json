I don't want to configure nginx, unless you have a Docker container or something I can use pre-configured.\r\n\r\nBut I also just noticed you set \"AllowHTTP: true\" and your DialTLS isn't dialing TLS, so it seems you're doing something non-standard and less supported. You're at least doing something which doesn't affect the standard library, which doesn't use either of those things.\r\n",
