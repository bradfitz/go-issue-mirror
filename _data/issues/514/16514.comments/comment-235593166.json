Should be fixed now.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I did some research and it seems this has to do with a errRequestCanceled error being returned from the HTTP/2 transport.go, which HTTPClient.Do interprets as a RoundTrip Failure, which makes it close the TCP connection. This is especially problematic when sending a significant number (e.g. \u003e20) of requests at roughly the same time, which will result in response headers for some of them to take some to return (e.g. \u003e100ms)",
