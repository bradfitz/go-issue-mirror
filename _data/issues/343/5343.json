	"body": "by **andrew@du.nham.ca**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eHi there,\n\nThe bug I'm running into is on Mac OS X, when trying to read from a TUN device.  I get\n\u0026quot;read /dev/tun0: resource temporarily unavailable\u0026quot;.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Install a TUN/TAP driver on Mac OS X.  Get one from \u003ca href=\"http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net\"\u003ehttp://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net\u003c/a\u003e,\nby installing Viscosity, or any other way.\n2. Possibly, modify the code that I've attached to configure to an IP address that\ndoesn't conflict.\n3. Double-check the code I've attached to make sure it's not doing anything silly :-)\n4. Run \u0026quot;sudo go run mac_os_x_tuntap_bug.go tun0\u0026quot;\n5. Observe the output, Ctrl-C to exit.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nI would expect that the Read call would block, or otherwise halt execution of the\ncurrent goroutine until data is available, or return EOF and not an error.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nAn infinite loop of \u0026quot;resource temporarily unavailable\u0026quot; messages.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nNot sure how to tell - just using whatever is installed from Homebrew.  Looks like they\njust compile it from source.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nMac OS X 10.7.5\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\u0026quot;go version go1.0.3\u0026quot;, according to \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot;\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThe functionality is correct when packets are available for reading - the read instead\ncompletes and prints the number of bytes read.  Reproducing this takes some fiddling\nwith routing tables, so I did not include instructions.\n\nI'd be happy to help test any solutions, or aid in reproduction.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5343/0/mac_os_x_tuntap_bug.go\"\u003emac_os_x_tuntap_bug.go\u003c/a\u003e (1285 bytes)",
