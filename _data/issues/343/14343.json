	"body": "I have a struct with string fields that I want outputted in HTML. As they are of type string, they're not showing unescaped so when I do `{{ .Post.Title }}` in the template I get outputs like: `Dan\u0026#39;s post!`. \r\n\r\nI have added `\u003cDOCTYPE html\u003e` to try and fix it but it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nI've found that I should make the fields of type `template.HTML`, ensuring that it is properly sanitised before outputting. However, I want to store it in a database and when I try, I get the error:\r\n\r\n`sql: converting Exec argument #0's type: unsupported type template.HTML, a string`\r\n\r\nAny ideas?",
