	"body": "by **nickdsnyder**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe testing package currently provides an API that is only useful to gotest, but it\nwould be nice if the API were made more general so that tests could be easily run from\nany Go code.\n\nSpecifically, the test runners (RunTests, RunExamples, RunBenchmarks) just write output\nto os.Stderr.\n\nAn easy improvement would be to add a io.Writer parameter to write output to.\n\nEven better would be to define a test result structure and return a slice of test\nresults (one per test run).\u003c/pre\u003e",
