Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Compile attached program dog.go\n2. Run the executable\n3. in another terminal `telnet localhost 1234`, then type hello.\n4. repeat step3, possibly more than once.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\nThe little server should write some text to stdout and close each \nconnection after it reads one line from it.  Instead it crashes with:\n\npollServer AddFD  7 :  epoll_ctl: no such file or directory \n\nafter the second (or possibly sometimes third) such connection.  I believe \nthis is associated with the fact that one goroutine closes a Conn that is \nbeing read by another goroutine.  This seems like a fairly standard \napproach.  In any case, at worst the read should fail (and I do check the \nerror code), rather than the entire program crashing.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n\nlinux, 386\n\nWhich revision are you using?
