That is, there is no scenario in which preempting C code will lead to a call to `runtime.gosave`.\r\n\r\nI'm fine with adding a sync instruction to `runtime.gosave` if we can see some path that requires it.  But I don't want to add it just because there might conceivably be a problem.  Right now I don't see how there could possibly be a problem.",
