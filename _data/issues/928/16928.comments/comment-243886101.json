If this goroutine is preempted and then immediately restarted on another processor, then without a guarantee of an intervening SYNC it could possibly enter a state where it would not be able to see it's most recent stores, because they would not have been committed to the coherence order yet. His final words were \"There's no room to debate this one\".\r\n",
