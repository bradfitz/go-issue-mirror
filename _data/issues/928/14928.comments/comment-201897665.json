It did break our tests, but it's\r\narguable whether that's a problem (FWIW we were creating the\r\nResponseRecorder directly to remain backwardly compatible with an old\r\nAPI that used it, even though we changed all our tests to use httptest.NewServer\r\ninstead for better correspondence of tests to real world behaviour).\r\n",
