Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version devel +adb1e67 Tue Aug 30 08:08:37 2016 +0000 linux/ppc64le\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nUbuntu 16.04\r\n\r\nWe haven't hit a specific problem in this area yet, but there are concerns that some additional instructions should be included in the runtime.gosave routine when a goroutines's information is saved before it is swapped off a thread.  We should be doing a sync and an instruction to clear any lwarx reservation that might be pending.\r\n\r\n",
