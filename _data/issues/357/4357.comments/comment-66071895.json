Folk\nwant a way to have \"omitempty\" do the right thing with a zero time.Time, namely have it\nnot appear at all in the output, just like ints and strings. One would need either\nsomething like what #20 describes (there is precedent in path/filepath.SkipDir), or have\nthe relevant packages look for an IsZero method when they support special handling of\nzero values.\n\nThe new \"encoding\" package in Go 1.2 lays some groundwork, and gives control to types to\ndetermine how they are marshaled; I think we should seriously consider extending that to\nsupport zero values too.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-go1.3maybe**, removed **priority-later**, **release-none**._",
