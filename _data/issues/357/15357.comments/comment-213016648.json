	"body": "Rather than a wrapper, I think we should just add a check to the generated code. Before calling makeslice, on 32 bits systems: (1) check whether the arguments are constants that are too large, in which case fail at compile time, (2) check whether the arguments have int64 type, and if so, insert `if /*unlikely*/ int64(int(len)) != len || int64(int(cap)) != cap { panic appropriately }`. The relevant code is in walk.go (search for the only instance of makeslice there) if you want to give it a try.",
