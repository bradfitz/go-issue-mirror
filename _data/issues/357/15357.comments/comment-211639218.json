	"body": "Code is permitted to pass a `int64` or `uint64` to `make`, so changing these functions to take type `int` will require adding code to check for overflow somewhere.\r\n\r\nIn gccgo I have two different functions, one that takes `uintptr` and one that takes `uint64`.  The latter function calls the former after checking that the values are in range.  The compiler generates a call to the second one if the argument types are larger than `uintptr`.  I can't remember whether I copied this idea from gc or not, but gc doesn't seem to do it today.",
