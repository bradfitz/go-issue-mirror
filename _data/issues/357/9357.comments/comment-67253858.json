And if one is to be changed, the more conservative way is to make it work in both cases.\r\nBTW I don't think it's unreasonable to expect it to work: go get generally allows repos to be prefixed at any level including root (not on github of course), and repos can contain packages at any level including root, so disallowing having a package in a repo root, only in the case when it happens to be prefixed at a domain root, can be seen an odd exclusion. But I don't mind either way as long as it's consistent.\r\n\r\n@adg\r\nBy working as intended, do you mean I can rely on it to continue to work in the future in the cases when it works with Go1.4? (The second example above, \"$DOMAIN\" imported via \"$DOMAIN/$SUBPKG\"?)\r\n",
