So passing pointer to the triplet seems to be a\nbetter option.\n\nI'm currently trying to imagine, why documentation change should be preferred. So far\nthe only reason I can think of is that it's a builtin function and people are used to\nit. Are there some other reasons why append shouldn't be changed?\u003c/pre\u003e",
