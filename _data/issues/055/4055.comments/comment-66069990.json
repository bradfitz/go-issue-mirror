For example:\n\n\"The append function returns a slice consisting of the elements x appended to s. If the\ncapacity of s is big enough to hold the resulting slice, it copies x to s[len(s):] and\nreturns s[:len(s)+len(x)]. Otherwise, a new sufficiently large slice is allocated and\nfilled.\"\n\nIf something along these lines is acceptable, I'd be happy to send a CL.\u003c/pre\u003e",
