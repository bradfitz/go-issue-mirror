It would be nice, especially when decoding a moving image, to decode into an\nexisting buffer.\n\nAlso, it would be nice to be able to resize an image during (and not after) decoding,\nwhich can obviously allocate a smaller buffer but can also be faster. Apparently\nImagemagick can do this for JPEGs, and\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/forum/#\u003c/a\u003e!topic/golang-nuts/13Gr_AmBAKY claims a 50% speedup for\ngenerating a thumbnail.\n\nThe two concerns are superficially separate, but the API (if any) to do this should\nprobably consider both use cases.\u003c/pre\u003e",
