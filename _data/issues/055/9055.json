	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe LastBoundary methods seems inconsistent as to\nwhere it reports a boundary. When called with a string\ncontaining a single (non-combining) character, the boundary\nis sometimes reported at the start of the string\nand sometimes at the end:\n\nThis code:\n\n    fmt.Printf(\u0026quot;%d\\n\u0026quot;, norm.NFD.LastBoundary([]byte(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;)))\n    fmt.Printf(\u0026quot;%d\\n\u0026quot;, norm.NFD.LastBoundary([]byte(\u0026quot;â™”\u0026quot;)))\n\nprint 0 and 3. I would expect it to print 0 and 0 or 1 and 3.\n\nPerhaps it would be better if neither FirstBoundary (LastBoundary)\nnever reported a boundary at the start (end) of a string.\nThat way it becomes easier to use FirstBoundary and LastBoundary\nto iterate through strings when use of Iter is not convenient.\u003c/pre\u003e",
