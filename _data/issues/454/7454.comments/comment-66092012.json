The \"saves\" are stored as resources\nand can be partially updated (set a description for instance) by sending a PATCH\nrequest. A PUT request would not be appropriate since we only make a partial change to\nthe resource.\n\nWould you like me to explain more in details? Or did I miss the point of your question?\u003c/pre\u003e",
