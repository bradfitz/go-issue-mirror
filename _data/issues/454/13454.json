	"body": "This package supports detecting proxies with protocol `socks5://`, e.g. `socks5://localhost:5000`, but not `socks5h://`.  Since this is a common format (e.g. http://blog.mafr.de/2013/11/24/setting-up-a-socks-proxy-using-openssh/) and other tools such as `curl` support it, this package should likely support it as well.  I can potentially submit code to support this if desired.\r\n\r\nThe offending line: https://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/proxy/proxy.go#L81 .  Both seem to be valid to `curl`, so perhaps both should be supported.",
