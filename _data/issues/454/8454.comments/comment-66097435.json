And it will be written in Go too.\n\nThe ultimate goal for 6a is that it will be based on latest\nintel manuals, so it will support all the latest instructions.\n\nAnyway, for xxHash, I suggest you'd better write it in Go.\nThe first reason is that the Plan 9 C Compiler will go away\neventually, and 2nd is that 6g will become better over time,\nbut we definitely won't spend time to improve 6c.\u003c/pre\u003e",
