The reason for the\nextra blank line is that the source code indeed has an extra line in the source code and\nthus that extra line is honored by the printer (but since there's no comment to print,\nit's empty).\n\nOne could change godoc.go:1017 to call ast.MergePackageFiles w/o the filtering of\ncomments, but in general this is incorrect because the comments list is not maintained\nin sync with other filtering operations:\n\npast = ast.MergePackageFiles(pkg, ast.FilterUnassociatedComments)\n\nThe correct fix is to properly filter/merge the comments lists whenever any AST\nfiltering/merging is happening (go/ast/filter.go); which is not entirely trivial.\u003c/pre\u003e",
