	"body": "\u003cpre\u003estack copying makes the assumption that the heap contains no pointers to the stack.\nin the case of deferred closures that contain pointers to outer stack variables,\nthis assumption is true because escape analysis moves the closure allocation\nfrom the heap to the stack.\n\nin -N mode, escape analysis is disabled. this breaks the assumption and causes crashes\ndue to stale pointers.\n\nthe fix seems to be to do escape analysis always instead of trying to maintain both\n'with' and 'without' code paths. escape analysis can be debugged with the -m output.\n\n-N will still disable registerization, as it always has.\n\ncaused a crash for bill kennedy.\ndvyukov observed that go test -gcflags -N archive/zip is enough to reproduce.\u003c/pre\u003e",
