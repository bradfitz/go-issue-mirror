It gets called in the runtime test suite by TestNewOSProc0, which presumably runs after TestMemStats. In a single run, this means when TestMemStats runs, stacks_sys==0. But in a multi-run, the first run of TestNewOSProc0 will run before the second run of TestMemStats, so the second run of TestMemStats sees stacks_sys!=0.\r\n\r\nThe problem is just as easy to trigger with\r\n    go test -short runtime -cpu=1,1",
