With the single runs of the runtime test, StackSys == 0 before this shuffle, so it's fine to clobber it with StackInuse and pull that amount out of HeapSys. Everything still adds up to Sys. But with the multiple runs StackSys != 0 at this point, so when we clobber it, the new sum differs from the original sum in Sys by this much.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why multiple runs changes this, but this shuffle smells wrong.",
