	"body": "A common idiom is to keep a single timer and extend its\r\nuse by calling Timer.Reset.\r\n\r\nFrom a naive reading of the documentation, these two\r\nlines are equivalent except for saving some garbage:\r\n\r\n    t.Reset(x)\r\n\r\n    t := time.NewTimer(x)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately t.C is buffered, so if the timer has just expired,\r\nthe newly reset timer can actually trigger immediately.\r\n\r\nThe safe way to do it might be someting like:\r\n\r\n\tt.Stop()\r\n\tselect {\r\n\tcase \u003c-t.C:\r\n\tdefault:\r\n\t}\r\n\tt.Reset(x)\r\n\r\nbut this is cumbersome. Perhaps we could change Reset to do this\r\nas a matter of course.\r\n\r\n",
