	"body": "I found a lot of files in the builder's /tmp directory of this form:\r\ngoXXXXX and javaXXXXX.\r\n\r\nThe content of these files showed that they are temporary files for the gobind tests:\r\n```\r\n// Package go_basictypes is an autogenerated binder stub for package basictypes.\r\n//   gobind -lang=go basictypes\r\n//\r\n// File is generated by gobind. Do not edit.\r\npackage go_basictypes\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n        \"basictypes\"\r\n        \"golang.org/x/mobile/bind/seq\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc proxy_ByteArrays(out, in *seq.Buffer) {\r\n        param_x := in.ReadByteArray()\r\n        res := basictypes.ByteArrays(param_x)\r\n        out.WriteByteArray(res)\r\n}\r\n// snip\r\n```\r\nAnd\r\n```\r\n// Java Package interfaces is a proxy for talking to a Go program.\r\n//   gobind -lang=java interfaces\r\n//\r\n// File is generated by gobind. Do not edit.\r\npackage go.interfaces;\r\n\r\nimport go.Seq;\r\n\r\npublic abstract class Interfaces {\r\n    private Interfaces() {} // uninstantiable\r\n// snip\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps this the reason why some builders' file system has been filled.\r\n\r\nPS: I just cleaned up the /tmp yesterday, and now it has accumulated about 200 of these\r\nfiles, so I'm certain this bug is still there.",
