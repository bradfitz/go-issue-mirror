Again, these features\r\nare just not designed to combine tests for multiple packages\r\ninto a single executable.\r\n\r\nAlso note that tests for a package needs to run at the\r\ndirectory for the package, how to handle that when\r\ntests for multiple packages are combined into one binary?\r\n\r\n(FTR, I have been thinking about this feature a long time\r\nago, but my conclusion was and still is that the whole thing\r\nis not designed for this.)\r\n",
