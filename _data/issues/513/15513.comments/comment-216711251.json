Same situation here, I'd say.\r\n\r\n\u003e conflicting flags added by tests\r\n\r\nSorry, what do you mean by this?\r\n\r\n\u003e multiple TestMains\r\n\r\nRefuse to compile, with a lucid error message. Rare.\r\n\r\n\u003e tests for a package needs to run at the directory for the package\r\n\r\nos.Chdir? Note that the go command has the directory available at compilation time. This is a bit ugly for the cross-compilation case, but we could print a warning instead of failing when os.Chdir fails.\r\n\r\n\u003e I have been thinking about this feature a long time\r\nago\r\n\r\nYeah, I recall there being another issue about this but couldn't find it.\r\n\r\nI agree that there are limitations, I just see them as limitations rather than showstoppers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
