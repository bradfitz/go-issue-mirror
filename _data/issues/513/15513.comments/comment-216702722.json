What's more, the behavior also depends on the\norder tests for different packages are run.) because cmd/go\ndoesn't support negative patterns, there is no way to use ./...\nand exclude B.\n\nGiven a large enough GOPATH, it's very likely there are bad\ninteractions between the package tests, and then basically\nthe new feature is useless (in the worse case, the user has\nto name all the packages on the command line, and it's no\nbetter than status quo.)\n\nWe might be able to do this if multiple packages are compiled\ninto a single package from the beginning, but I don't think we\ncan add this feature now.\n",
