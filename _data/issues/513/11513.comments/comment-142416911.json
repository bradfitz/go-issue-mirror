It returns true if the call stops the timer, false if the timer has already expired or been stopped. Stop does not close the channel, to prevent a read from the channel succeeding incorrectly.\r\n\r\nWhile technically true, \"prevents the Timer from firing\" isn't the same as \"prevents future channel reads from succeeding\", which is what is observable to the user.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the intention of Stop is subtly incompatible with the semantics of buffered channels.",
