Yet my original test case is fine with go1.1.1 and broken with tip, so I\ndon't know what's going on there. Perhaps my test case is subtly different and no longer\nhighlights the regression.\n\nEither way, there's still a bug that seems worth fixing, and it sounds like you're on\nthe culprit.\u003c/pre\u003e",
