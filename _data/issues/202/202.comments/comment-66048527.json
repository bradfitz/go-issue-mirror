I've just began looking through the documentation for a bit, but hadn't found \nany references to this package yet. Great to know it exists.\n\nAs a systems programmer this could have been a deal breaker. I was about to dismiss Go \ncompletely as a real systems language, but figured I'd ask first, glad I did. But it \nwould probably be wise to add this info to the language FAQ, so other system \nprogrammers don't miss this feature and leave before asking.\u003c/pre\u003e",
