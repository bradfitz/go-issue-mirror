My  aggravation actually faded somewhat after seeing how not very common this\nis. I'd just like timezone handling to be perfect everywhere so that we all would be\nhappy and smiling when it comes time to deal with human readable time.  \n\nSadly, the state of time handling is universally still cringe-worthy,\napproximation-filled and overall, a very fragile thing. \n\ntd;lr: It's a desirable feature but considering how uncommon it is that times are\nformatted to preserve all information, this might be reasonable to make compromises.\u003c/pre\u003e",
