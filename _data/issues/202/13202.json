	"body": "When you view, for example, the dev.ssa branch on build.golang.org, all commits* are prefixed with [dev.ssa].  Together with the fact that there's not a lot of space for the commit title, you end up with the build dashboard looking like:\r\n\r\n[dev.ssa] cmd/compile: ...\r\n[dev.ssa] cmd/compile: ...\r\n[dev.ssa] cmd/compile: ...\r\n[dev.ssa] cmd/compile: ...\r\n[dev.ssa] cmd/compile: ...\r\n\r\nwhich is pretty uninformative.  It's similarly redundant for all the other branches.  Could we elide the [branch] prefix?  It's useful for email but for the dashboard we've already filtered on this field.\r\n\r\n*except merges from master\r\n\r\n@bradfitz @adg ",
