	"body": "by **Robert.Jay.Gould**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eGo is a systems language, but without pointer logic, or inline assembler code \n(like C/C++), how can we interface with hardware? Perhaps there should be an \nunsafe system like that of C#, so Go can be embedded and interfaced directly \nwith hardware, other ways.\n\nThen again I may be missing something, there might already be a way to \ninterface hardware with Go, if so something in the FAQ or a tutorial would be \nnice.\n\nThanks!\u003c/pre\u003e",
