Would you want this CL separately from adding WebGL or is fine to do everything in one?\r\n\r\nAnother issue I've noticed in the internal [`glBoolean`](https://github.com/golang/mobile/blob/6ed9b243b17195bbfcddc0c6d63c3610e840e962/gl/types_common.go#L82-L87) helper:\r\n\r\n```Go\r\nfunc glBoolean(b bool) C.GLboolean {\r\n\tif b {\r\n\t\treturn 0\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIts logic seems to return the opposite of what it should. Is that unintentional?\r\n\r\nIf so, I'll fix that too, and probably use the `TRUE` and `FALSE` consts.",
