	"body": "I'm not sure whether this proposal covers #8540 and #11160. My concerns about having a new package related to DNS stuff are simply 1) Will the package be able to support any DNS transport including plain UDP, TCP through TLS/DTLS and 2) Will the package be able to interact with the net, crypto/tls and crypto/x509 packages of standard library seamlessly and without any API breaking changes.\r\n\r\nIf this proposal covers the existing issues, in other words this proposal keeps some blueprint on good DNS package separation for avoiding circular dependency and complexity, I'd like to accept this proposal and want to merge #8540 and #11160 into this.\r\n",
