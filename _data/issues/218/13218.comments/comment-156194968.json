	"body": "I believe we should turn vendor on by default as planned in Go 1.6. Prolonging the time in which there are two modes of operation only increases pain and makes it that much harder for people to actively adopt the feature. Anyone who doesn't want \"vendor\" semantics has a very simple recourse: rename any directory named \"vendor\" to something else. All of us working at tip have been using the new vendor semantics for the whole Go 1.6 cycle and they seem to be working fine. \r\n\r\nI don't see the lack of consensus that you do. I see that you disagree, but overall the vast majority of people seem happy with the new \"vendor\" semantics.\r\n\r\n/cc @bradfitz @davecheney @kardianos @adg @kr for thoughts.",
