It's perfectly fine to vendor a package\nin a package,\nif its use is entirely internal.\n\n\u003e Anyone can turn vendoring off by renaming the directory they have named\n\u003e \"vendor\"\n\u003e\n\u003e As someone who imports a third party package that is using vendoring,\n\u003e against this standard, I do not easily have this option. I'd have to\n\u003e convince that package owner that they should remove vendoring, or maintain\n\u003e my own fork.\n\u003e\n\u003e Do we agree that what I described earlier should not occur? Should the\n\u003e build tool resolve vendor/foo/bar/a for package vendor/fizz/buzz/b, when b\n\u003e itsself has been vendored into another project (what I was describing as\n\u003e deep vendoring)?\n\u003e\nI don't agree. According to the design docs of the vendoring experiment,\nrecursive\nvendoring has well defined semantic: a given import will always choose the\nbest\n(i.e. longest) match from the list of candidate vendored copies.\n",
