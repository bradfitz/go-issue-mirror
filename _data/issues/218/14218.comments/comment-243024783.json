Object\nfiles in 1.7 are ~20% smaller than 1.6 and noone seemed too excited about\nthat :-)\n\n\u003e I'm not sure what other changes are planned that this could be submitted\n\u003e with/integrated into to minimize disruption from the object file format\n\u003e change.\n\u003e\nI think the experience of the 1.7 cycle was also that changing the object\nfile format is not as disruptive as one might think.\n\nCheers,\nmwh\n",
