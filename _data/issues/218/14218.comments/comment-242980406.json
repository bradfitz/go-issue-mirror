I think it would be possible to reduce the object sizes by reducing the sizes of the types we are using for `RelocType` \u0026 `RelocVariant` from `int32` to `int16`. As it currently stands I suspect it's not a valuable enough change to warrant the size increase.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what other changes are planned that this could be submitted with/integrated into to minimize disruption from the object file format change.",
