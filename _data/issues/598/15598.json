	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo1.6.2 windows/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nWindows 8.1, amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nDownload Go for the first time, to see what the language is about.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nUseful information on setting up and using Go.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nMost of the advice on the website is downright wrong.  For example, the website says to set GOPATH:\r\n\r\n    C:\\\u003e set GOPATH=%HOME%\\work\r\n\r\nOn Windows, following this advice will lead to a go installation that does not work.  First, the variable is named %HOMEPATH%, and second, the variable is relative so it should be %HOMEDRIVE%\\%HOMEPATH%.\r\n\r\nAfter manually correcting GOPATH, I tried building the \"Hello, world!\" example, also from the page.\r\n\r\nThe page then illustrates how to build the .go file, using \"go install\" (?).  This does not work:\r\n\r\n    C:\\Users\\Sean\\Code\\go\\hello\u003ego install github.com/user/hello\r\n    can't load package: package github.com/user/hello: cannot find package \"github.com/user/hello\" in any of:\r\n            C:\\Go\\src\\github.com\\user\\hello (from $GOROOT)\r\n            C:\\Users\\Sean\\Code\\go\\src\\github.com\\user\\hello (from $GOPATH)\r\n    \r\n    C:\\Users\\Sean\\Code\\go\\hello\u003e\r\n\r\nAs a brand-new user, this is very confusing.",
