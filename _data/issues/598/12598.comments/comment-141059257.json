This way, we can clarify some fog here. \r\n\r\n1) I will build a test apk for you to run that has confirmed failure and success on different devices. \r\n2) Send me the apk to test which works on your OnePlus. \r\n\r\nPlease email me at xing@fictionpress.com and we can start exchanging some test files. \r\n",
