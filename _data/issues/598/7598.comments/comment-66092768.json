For now we never set SO_REUSEADDR to 1 for stream listener sockets on\nWindows. Perhaps, it's related to IPV6_V6ONLY. When you have three listeners on 80/tcp,\nnot sure the reason, but probably they are:\n1) AF_INET, 80/tcp4, single endpoint,\n2) AF_INET6, 80/tcp6, IPV6_V6ONLY=1, single endpoint,\n3) AF_INET6, 80/tcp4 and 80/tcp6, IPV6_V6ONLY=0, dual endpoints,\n\nHmm...\u003c/pre\u003e",
