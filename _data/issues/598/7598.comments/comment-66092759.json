It's obvious that your 1st\ntcp endpoint holder uses address family IPv4, and 2nd one uses IPv6. How should we\nbehave on the dual IP stack node that implements either BIA (bump-in-API) or BIS\n(bump-in-stack) feature? I think this is equivalent to tcp4+\"\", then tcp6+\"\" case in\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/src/pkg/net/unicast_posix_test.go#L112\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/src/pkg/net/unicast_posix_test.go#L112\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nI'm guessing that the difference btw go1.0.3 and go1.2 comes from the fix for issue\n2581. So I'd like to say that current behavior is expected, and sorry for the confusion.\nThat \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/2581\"\u003eissue #2581\u003c/a\u003e was one of my blunders submitted in just before Go 1 release.\n\nnet: OS X allows duplicate listen in single process?\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/issue/2581\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/issue/2581\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
