Skype, Apache, etc.\n\nObservations:\nWith go1.0.3, the example program will error out.\n\nWith go1.2, the example program (successfully?) binds to the port\n\nEdge case:\nIf the first process that binds port 80 is a go program, the go1.0.3 example program\nwill not error out either.\n\nIf an additional instance of the compiled example program (in either go version) is run,\nit will correctly error out.\n\nAdditional notes:\nI tested the program on Ubuntu 12.04 x64 and in both go versions, it errors out\ncorrectly.\n\nI tried testing on Mac OSX (Mountain Lion and Mavericks), but did not end up with\nconclusive results, so please check this out as well.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/7598/0/regression.go\"\u003eregression.go\u003c/a\u003e (178 bytes)",
