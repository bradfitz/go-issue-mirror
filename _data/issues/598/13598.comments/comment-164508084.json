But we advertise in our TLS connection that we speak \"h2\" but we never mention that we also speak \"http/1.1\", and Box's frontend recognizes ALPN or NPN enough to know that they can't handle \"h2\", so they hang up on us.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to declare that we also speak \"http/1.1\" as a fallback.\r\n\r\nEasy fix.\r\n",
