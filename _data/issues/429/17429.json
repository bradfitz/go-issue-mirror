	"body": "Reasons:\r\n1. \"var _ = x\" is legal.\r\n2. Often, in debugging/developing a program, programmers often change a line like \r\n\u003e _, newV, _ := x, y, z\r\n\r\nto\r\n\u003e _, _, _ := x, y, z\r\n\r\nand change them back and forth for several times.\r\n\r\nBut \" _, _, _ := x, y, z\" is illegal, programmer must change it to \"_, _, _ = x, y, z\". \r\nThis may be a small inconvenience, but it is really annoying.",
