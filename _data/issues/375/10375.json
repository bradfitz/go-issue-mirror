	"body": "The .svg profile as generated by pprof's `web` command includes some Javascript from https://www.cyberz.org/projects/SVGPan/SVGPan.js\r\n\r\nthe file is linked here: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/5f8423844463b3b77588e46ea57f44d8b69a1564/src/cmd/pprof/internal/driver/driver.go#L628\r\n\r\nI found it surprising to find pprof's SVG has external dependencies. Not just because of tracking reasons (I don't think cyberz.org need to know about my pprof usage), but also because it doesn't always work (e.g. working on a train).\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to just include the javascript code verbatim in the .SVG, or otherwise to not include the external link by default?\r\n\r\n",
