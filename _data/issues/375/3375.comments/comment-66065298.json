That\nfile is constructed from i386-builtin-types.def using awk.  In i386-builtin-types.inc I\nsee this:\n\n  VOID_FTYPE_PINT_INT,\n  VOID_FTYPE_PLONGLONG_LONGLONG,\n  VOID_FTYPE_PULONGLONG_ULONGLONG,\n\nI'm guessing that for you VOID_FTYPE_PLONGLONG_LONGLONG will be missing.  When I look at\nthe awk script, I don't really see how that could be.  The awk script is in\ngcc/config/i386/i386-builtin-types.awk.  It's run as\n\nawk -f i386-builtin-types.awk i386-builtin-types.def\n\nMy only guess at this point is that there is some sort of bug or surprising behaviour in\nthe version of awk that you are using.  It might be interesting to try debugging that,\nor you could just try using GNU awk.\u003c/pre\u003e",
