	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eKeith's recent changes to the runtime pass addresses of temporaries to chan and map\ncalls. The liveness analysis should be modified to know when the temporaries die, so\nthat they are not preserved to the end of the function (like most temporaries). That\nwill reduce the number of things that need zeroing at function entry, which in turn will\nreduce the cost of enabling GOEXPERIMENT=precisestack. Right now that cost is about 8\nseconds out of 160 for all.bash on my 2012 rMBP, or about 5%.\n\nWe may enable precisestack without a fix for this, so that we can get it soaking and\nbecause it is needed for copying stacks. But we need to address the performance cost for\nGo 1.3.\u003c/pre\u003e",
