(On the other hand, disable\nthe warning is also a valid workaround, but it's slightly harder as\nthe code is being compiled by cmd/dist.)\n\nThe 1st problem is slightly different. I think a valid workaround is\nto disable cgo when building Go 1.4 (export CGO_ENABLED=0\nbefore running make.bash), because bootstrapping Go 1.5 doesn't\nrequire cgo.\n",
