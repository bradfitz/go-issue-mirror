I actually think that we might need to make new point release in some cases.\r\n\r\nIn this case, I think we should consider a patch for 1.4 that drops -Werror from the list of command line options.  And I think that the FreeBSD build process should set CGO_ENABLED=0 when building Go 1.4.  I think those two steps should fix the FreeBSD build.",
