You can work around it by setting resolve.conf to use\nnameservers at 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 :-)\n\nThe salient clue is that that the first DNS request goes through -- subsequent ones\ndo not (at least for a while).\n\nThe current code uses a constant transaction id of x1234 (see _Exchange in\ndnsclient.go).   The 2wire gateway seems not respond to duplicate requests.\n\nConstant id (out.id=0x1234) needs to be replaced.   Not sure of direction of\ndnsclient, but could start with incrementing global for now (as this solves an\nimmediate issue).   Probably best to  have a random start basis for each go program\n(easy) or goproc (harder since it would need goproc specific context \u0026 is probably\noverkill)  and it should be checked in the answer routine (this is just being safe,\nbut may not be necessary).\n\n[Note: this has been an irritant for a while as the go build test suite fails unless\nthe resolve.conf is set away from a 2wire router]\u003c/pre\u003e",
