When os/exec detects that stdout and stderr\nare the same writer, it passes the pipe representing stdout to the underlying exec as\nstderr. \n\nssh is a little different, we have two handlers for stdout and strerr, this goes all the\nway up to the channel level, and they are established quite early. The easiest thing\nwill probably be to keep kr's singleWriter but make it internal.\u003c/pre\u003e",
