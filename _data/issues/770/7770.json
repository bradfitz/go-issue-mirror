	"body": "by **jeffreydwalter**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the\nlatest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat does 'go version' print?\ngo version go1.2.1 darwin/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n1. Download the code from this example: \u003ca href=\"http://blog.golang.org/pipelines/bounded.go\"\u003ehttp://blog.golang.org/pipelines/bounded.go\u003c/a\u003e\n(I've also attached bounded.go to this bug.)\n2. Do the following:\n     a) Create a test directory in the current working directory.\njw$ mkdir test\n     b) Create a symlink to test directory in the current working directory.\njw$ ln -s test symbolic_test\n     c) Run the bounded.go example and pass the current working directory as the argument.\njw$ sudo go run bounded.go \u0026quot;`pwd`\u0026quot;\n\nWhat happened?\nI get the following output:  \nread /Users/jw/Code Library/go/src/com/bounded/test: is a directory, and the program\nstops execution.\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\nI expect that this path should not fail to read with the \u0026quot;is a directory\u0026quot;\nmessage, and should continue to walk the directory, eventually returning md5's for all\nof the files in the current working directory (including sub-directories.)\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI'm not sure if this is a bug in the example code, or in the go library itself. It seems\nthat the error is happening either in os.FileInfo or in filepath.Walk.\nI did find \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/6656\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/6656\u003c/a\u003e, so this issue may be\nfixed already, but definitely something to double-check.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/7770/0/bounded.go\"\u003ebounded.go\u003c/a\u003e (3171 bytes)",
