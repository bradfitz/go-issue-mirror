It would be nice if this error also included the\nexpected and found number of lines. So, for example, instead of the error string being\n\u0026quot;wrong number of fields in line\u0026quot;, it would be instead \u0026quot;wrong number of\nfields in line. 15 read, 10 expected\u0026quot;. The specific problem I encountered was that\nmy csv file had an extra delimiter at the end of the line, so one more record was read\nthan I expected. If the error message had also listed that there was one more record\nthan expected it would have been much easier to debug.\u003c/pre\u003e",
