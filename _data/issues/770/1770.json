	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\nN/A\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Using Firefox 3.6.17 [Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; cs-CZ; rv:1.9.2.17)\nGecko/20110422 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.17] visit golang.org.\n\n2. Enter into the playground's text area:\npackage main\n\nfunc main() {\n\tprintln(\u0026quot;%\u0026quot;)\n}\n\n3. Verify it's OK by clicking the \u0026quot;COMPILE \u0026amp; RUN\u0026quot; button (or shift-enter).\n\n4. The single percent sign is seen as the correct output of the above program.\n\n5. Click the \u0026quot;Pop Out\u0026quot; link bellow the input yellow text area.\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nA new window with the program as in step 2.\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nA new window with the \u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot; example.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nN/A\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nSee details in step 1.\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nN/A\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nDoing all the same while replacing the percent sign with e.g. a hash sign (#) works as\nexpected. The problem seems to be related with the value %25 in the escaped URL in the\npop out window. Additionally, everything works (both with % and with #) OK in a Chrome\nbrowser [11.0.696.57 beta]. Other browsers were not tested.\u003c/pre\u003e",
