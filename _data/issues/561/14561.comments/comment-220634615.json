	"body": "@mdempsky Thank you so much for the time you put into debugging that!  I was just reviewing the live project code and I fixed the infinite loop some time ago, but didn't realize that was the cause of the select race.  I'm sorry you ended up wasting time on a duplicate bug, but I really appreciate both the time you spent as well as the diagnostic steps you shared above.  That is an incredibly useful diagnostic procedure.  Thanks again!",
