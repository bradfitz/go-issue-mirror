Two reasons: \n1) All the cases mentioned so far can be trivially added as functions (or could be\ndone with a preprocessor - but that's a different issue)\n2) While it may seem 'odd' now to see m[k] = nil, false - It is good to remind\noneself that at one time it was odd to see a language with an idiom like 'x += 10' (I\nstarted coding in Fortran II).  We (the programmers) will get used to the new idioms.\u003c/pre\u003e",
