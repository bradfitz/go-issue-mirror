	"body": "It'd be useful if drivers could augment the list of data types supported by database/sql/convert.go. The ability to implement driver.Valuer and sql.Scanner for one's own structs is great, but there are core types I'd like to be able to use, as well. For example, PostgreSQL supports array types. I'd love to be able to convert between slices and SQL arrays. It makes sense that database/sql would not support this, but if there was an interface for the pg or pgx drivers to add it for core types, it would be super useful. Perhaps Driver could have methods for this kind of conversion? Maybe something like:\r\n\r\n\tif scanned, ok := driver.Scan(src); ok {\r\n\t\treturn scanned\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tif val, ok := driver.Value(src); ok {\r\n\t\treturn val\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThen the drivers could be updated to, say, convert between `[]string` and `TEXT[]`.",
