I've tried to look over some of the existing API issues and offer possibilities, but I'd like feedback before I start coding.\r\n\r\nAfter doing an overview, it certainly isn't impossible to continue the current API and add features. I will try to pursue adding to the API, but I think it is a mistake; we will be left with a split API and split driver support either way.\r\n\r\nI've made a rough list of features that will probably cause a driver and API split, and those that won't:\r\n\r\nCause split:\r\n * Add context\r\n * Specify Transaction Isolation Level\r\n * Specify Query Isolation Level\r\n * Named input parameters\r\n * Get result database types\r\n * Set input parameter database types\r\n * Support output parameters\r\n * Switch to output go string type for database text, char, varchar, nvarchar, varchar2 types\r\n\r\nSafely add:\r\n * Multiple result sets\r\n * Support custom types (Scan into array, map[string]interface{}, XML obj) [probably safe to add]\r\n * Get a single connection from the pool\r\n * Add bulk insert operation\r\n * Add Savepoint and RollbackTo\r\n * Support streaming large values (large binary values to prevent buffering everything) [probably safe to add]\r\n\r\n",
