	"body": "I agree with Joe, if reflect used to return unexported methods reliably (did it?), I think we should preserve that behavior.  People could be depending on it.  Returning only exported methods might have to wait until Go 2.\r\n\r\nIf you ever try to call such a method, it fails with an unexported field error.  So I don' think we need the actual implementation of that function to survive in the binary, just enough info to construct a reflect.Method for the unexported function (pkg, name, type, and a func stub that is the canonical \"unexported\" func).\r\n",
