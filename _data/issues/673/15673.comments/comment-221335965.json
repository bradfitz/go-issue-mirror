However they are there in Go 1, and have one valid use: determining interface satisfaction when using reflect inside a package that declares an interface with an unexported method.\r\n\r\nSo I believe we should keep that case working, which means surfacing any method that might meet that requirement. Unfortunately we do not have perfect information about that yet, so we are conservatively removing some methods we know cannot satisfy an interface. The change in https://golang.org/cl/21087, which won't make it for 1.7 gets even closer, and removes your ```bar``` example. Hopefully in 1.8 I can modify it to remove even more methods.",
