We even test it in misc/cgo/test, and I seem to recall fixing cgo so that those tests worked with gccgo.\r\n\r\nI guess I don't see why static variables can't work in principle.  We could generate static getters and setters and rewrite references in the Go code.  Unless that seems infeasible perhaps we should leave this open in case somebody wants to fix it.",
