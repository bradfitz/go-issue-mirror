You don't need to keep wc Wndclassex around after RegisterClassEx call.\nBut you do need to keep around\n\nvar wproc = syscall.NewCallback(WndProc)\n\nbecause go writes a little asm program in wproc for Windows to call back on and then the\ncall gets redirected to WndProc. So as long as you expect Windows to call WndProc, you\nmust keep wproc in memory and alive.\n\nRuss, would it make sense to change runtime so all Windows callbacks are not garbage\ncollected? I can't see a program that needs to create more then a couple of these.\nUnfortunately, I don't know enough about Windows GUI programming to make that judgement.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-windows**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
