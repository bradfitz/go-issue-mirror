	"body": "Yes, `go get` works for installing the vet tool, but that's oversimplifying my goal. I maintain some build processes that confirm that code passes vet before compiling, and using the unversioned `go get` command means that they're no longer strictly reproducible. This regression in the go1.4.3 tarball vs the other go1.4.x tarballs means that it's not a drop-in replacement.\r\n\r\nI can make sure my build containers have git installed and then `git clone`/`git checkout`/`go install` a specific version, I can repackage the tarball, or I can finish upgrading everything to go1.5 -- so I'm not without options. This just makes the upgrade process less smooth for me and anyone else using vet and go1.4.\r\n\r\nIf go1.4 is going to be an LTS release for bootstrapping, I think this should go into the go1.4.4 tarball when the time comes.",
