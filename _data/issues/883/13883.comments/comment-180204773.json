Perhaps instead of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar a [2]string\r\na[0] = \"Hello\"\r\na[1] = \"World\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe array could be declared like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\na := [2]string{\"Hello\", \"World\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would make it symmetrical with the declaration of the slice in the next slide:\r\n\r\n```\r\ns := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't cover the subtleties of arrays vs. slices, but the tour isn't really the place for subtleties, I think.",
