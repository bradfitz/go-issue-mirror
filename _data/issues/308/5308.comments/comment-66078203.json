If a channel is marked as reachable, make all goroutines blocked on it as\nreachable and include their stacks into roots. At the end of the scan goroutines not\nmarked as reachable are reported as dead.\nThis can be extended to other synchronization primitives and timers (timer which Time\nchan is not reachable other than from the timer is dead).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
