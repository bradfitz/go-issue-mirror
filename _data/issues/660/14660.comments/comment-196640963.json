	"body": "@tv42 Yeah, that occurred to me, but if that's the reason for the current API, that seems like a lot of engineering effort to solve a problem where \"don't do that\" might work.  :smile:   More specifically, \"don't cancel a context you didn't create\".  I don't know.\r\n\r\nI can understand the argument that it's hard to change the API after it's been in the wild for some time.  But I can also honestly say that it took me genuine head scratching and re-reading of the godocs and blog post multiple times before it clicked.\r\n\r\nIt might be as Matt suggested and just require some additional documentation.  Or it might be something where some API tweaks would honestly help.  I feel a bit bad for being a nay-sayer, but that's also why I tried to contribute some example code as a means of providing constructive feedback.",
