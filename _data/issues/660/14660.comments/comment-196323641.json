A struct with hidden fields suffices.\r\nAlso, WithTimeout and WithDeadline are somewhat doing the same. You could remove one of those. That would make things already a bit simpler.\r\n\r\nI understand what Brad said. Still I'd rather the decision be clearly examined for the long term. It was in x/context and not the stdlib for a reason.\r\n\r\ncontext.TODO was probably supposed to be for static analysis but I think it is not needed.",
