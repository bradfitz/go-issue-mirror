	"body": "One area seems haven't been discussed is the \"detach\" functionality of a context. We've found legitimate use cases (at least inside Google) that sometimes detach a context to pass into an async routine within the ServeHTTP path seems useful (if not the only correct way of handling it). For example, some server logging routine will need to hold references of {req,resp} but generally have nothing to do with the end user, so the post-response logging will happen in a goroutine that potentially lasts longer than ServeHTTP. \r\n\r\nI wonder if it is worth considering to merge the detach functionality into the context library?",
