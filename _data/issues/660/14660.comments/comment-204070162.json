	"body": "@rsc Overall the plan sounds OK. In the specific case of `http.Request`, I suggest we provide an API that makes it difficult to do the wrong thing. In particular, `(*http.Request).Context` could be a method that returns the Context, so the caller cannot change it. We provide the additional method `(*http.Request).WithContext(Context) *Request` to create a copy of the request with a new Context (which may be derived from the original request Context). \r\n",
