Which would be the generic pattern to handle any task than needs to outlast the execution context it stems from.\r\n\r\nIf any field had to be added to a http.Request, that would be a deadline, I tend to think.\r\n\r\nI am still concerned that if we are not careful and rethink execution contexts a little, unnecessary complexity will be introduced in the stdlib.
