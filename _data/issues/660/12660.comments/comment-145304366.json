Plugging in an iOS device did not help on its own, but when I tried running a sample iOS app on it, Xcode told me that my provisioning profiles were missing and it could try to fix it by resetting to default recommended settings. Letting it do that added a single provisioning profile. After that, I was able to deploy that sample iOS app to my iOS device.\r\n\r\nHowever, `gomobile` still doesn't work after that change, but now it's a different error:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ gomobile build -target=ios golang.org/x/mobile/example/basic\r\ngomobile: xcrun xcodebuild -configuration Release -project /var/folders/tw/kgz4v2kn4n7d7ryg5k_z3dk40000gn/T/gomobile-work-449284111/main.xcodeproj failed: exit status 65\r\n=== BUILD TARGET main OF PROJECT main WITH CONFIGURATION Release ===\r\n\r\nCheck dependencies\r\nCode Sign error: No matching provisioning profiles found: No provisioning profiles with a valid signing identity (i.e. certificate and private key pair) matching the bundle identifier “org.golang.todo.basic” were found.\r\n\r\n** BUILD FAILED **\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following build commands failed:\r\n\tCheck dependencies\r\n(1 failure)\r\n\r\n```",
