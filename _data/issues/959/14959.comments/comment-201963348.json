Since you changed syscall.LoadDLL (in CL 21140), you would have to provide similar alternative. In syscall package too. Otherwise people would have to change too much code if they need to import  x/sys/windows as well as syscall, and things can get messy. I don't use x/sys/windows myself, it is difficult for me to see what can go wrong here.\r\n\r\nAlex",
