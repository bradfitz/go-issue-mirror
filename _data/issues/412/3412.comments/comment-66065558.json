From memory we require .25 or .27 on intel, but in practice for rhel and Debian\nit's actually .32 as that is what ships in their current stable kernels, so I don't\nthink this is a big issue. \n\nIt will mean Rhel5 moves from unsupported to broken which is a shame, unless we have\nsome kind of fallback if the syscall fails. I think there is an example of that in the\nnet package already.\u003c/pre\u003e",
