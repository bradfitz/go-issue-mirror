Accept4() make a lot of sense, and requiring a 2.6.28+\nkernel shouldn't be a big issue.\n\nVarious tests tend to show that {read,write}NB do not (currently) bring significant\nimprovements (and possibly slow things down), so I would strip them out of a first patch.\n\nYour current patch doesn't apply cleanly (e.g fd.go doesn't exists anymore): would you\nmind just rebasing on tip first (without any refactoring) so we can run further\nbenchmarks?\n\nThanks,\nSebastien\u003c/pre\u003e",
