NixPkgs tries to explicit most of the dependencies.\n\nThe idea behind these is that accessing to a program is similar to dereferencing a \npointer.  Thus having incomplete dependencies is similar to guessing which memory area \nlooks like your data. (No such file or directory === Segmentation fault)\u003c/pre\u003e",
