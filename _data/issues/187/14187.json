	"body": "Run x/exp/shiny/example/basic program on Windows. Click program's window \"Close\" system button. The window disappears from the screen. But program continues to run. If I press Ctrl-C, the program exits.\r\n\r\nOnce main window is closed, it is impossible to do anything with that program. I think program should exit. That is how every Windows program behaves.\r\n\r\nMaybe unrelated. The program exits if I press Escape key. That is unusual for Windows program. But, I guess, it is OK, if clicking \"Close\" also works.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that Alt+F4 closes main window too. (but does not exit program). Alt+F4 is suppose to do what clicking \"Close\" does. It does that.\r\n\r\nAlex",
