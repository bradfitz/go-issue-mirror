Instead, I propose to add a field\n\n    RequestURI string\n\nto the http.Request struct; for an incoming request, this field\nwill hold the entire raw URL (what followed the GET, uninterpreted)\nand for an outgoing request, this field, if non-empty, takes precedence\nover the URL field.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-go1**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to **builder@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
