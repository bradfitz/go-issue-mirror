What I'm interested in is merging the two pieces of objfile reading code we have: cmd/internal/goobj/read.go and cmd/link/internal/ld/objfile.go.\r\n\r\nThat would mean some kind of type sharing between cmd/internal/goobj.Sym and cmd/link/internal/ld.LSym.\r\n\r\nIt looks like ld.LSym could have goobj.Sym as a field inside it, and use the goobj reading code.",
