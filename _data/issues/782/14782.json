	"body": "In CL 20489, @crawshaw observed that he was able to change the cmd/internal/obj's objfile writing code and cmd/link/internal/ld's objfile reading code, but no tests failed to indicate that cmd/internal/goobj should be updated too.\r\n\r\ncmd/internal/goobj used to be used by cmd/newlink, but that was deleted in CL 20380 (fb880b8).\r\n\r\nIt's also still used in cmd/internal/objfile/goobj.go, but that file isn't otherwise used either.\r\n\r\nI imagine that because of #14386, we might as well just remove the dead code.\r\n\r\n/cc @rsc ",
