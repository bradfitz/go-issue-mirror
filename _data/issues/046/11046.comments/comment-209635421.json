	"body": "The title says \"Decoder internally buffers full input\" but it might be better phrased as \"Decoder buffers an entire value at a time\".\r\n\r\nWe introduced Decoder.Token last cycle so it is technically possible for the user to use that and avoid buffering a whole value at once. Admittedly that would take a bunch of code.\r\n\r\nIt would also be possible for the decoder to stop decoding a whole value at once and instead read from the stream into the target structure incrementally. That would be a big refactoring of the decoder. Is that what this bug requires, or is there some simpler option I'm overlooking?",
