We cannot change the default behavior: right now if encoding/json consumes a very large but ultimately malformed JSON value, _nothing_ is written to the destination. Incremental decoding would change those semantics by writing to the destination before realizing the value was malformed.\r\n\r\nIt might be possible to have a different opt-in mode in the Decoder, but certainly not at this point in the Go 1.7 cycle.",
