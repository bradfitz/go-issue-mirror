The core part of etcd does not involve cgo/unsafe, but we are using external pkgs. So I am not sure. \r\n\r\n\u003e Have you tried to run it with race detector enabled?\r\n\r\nA normal go user program can corrupt runtime data? Or the race detector can detect data race in cgo? I cannot reproduce the issue myself right now. I do not know if it helps to collect data by enabling race detector.\r\n  \r\n",
