	"body": "I agree with Austin and Dave that this should be closed until the program\npasses the race detector. That said I am sympathetic to Xlang's\nexpectations that the runtime needs to be more robust against racy code.\nThere is a history of C malloc implementations pulling their free lists\nfrom the heap and building them outside of the heap to avoid triggering\nheap corruption bugs. Obviously racy programs will always be a problem and\nwe won't be able to completely insulate the runtime from them. Long term we\nare headed in this direction.\n\n\nOn Mon, Oct 26, 2015 at 10:52 AM, Austin Clements \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e Ah, sorry, I hadn't realized you were the poster of the original bug.\n\u003e\n\u003e I'm inclined to agree with @davecheney \u003chttps://github.com/davecheney\u003e\n\u003e that there's not much we can do until the races are fixed.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/13046#issuecomment-151163354\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
