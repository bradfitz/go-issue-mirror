However, I don't believe the fix here was correct. It should have ignored the\nnull, not made it an error. This is consistent with the non-,string unmarshaling, as\namended due to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/2540\"\u003eissue #2540\u003c/a\u003e. I am going to change this behavior as part of fixing issue\n8587. That should make nicolashillegeer happy at least.\u003c/pre\u003e",
