Because, mingw bash shell sometimes does\nthis:\n\n$ perl -e 'use Cwd; print getcwd();'\n/home/brainman\n\nAnd you will not be able to translate this to \"windows path\". I think we should go back\nto the original code instead. I will send a change unless someone beats me to it.\n\nI also think the fact that builder succeeds, while the test is broken, puts idea of\nusing perl here in question again.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
