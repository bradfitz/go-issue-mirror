What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n\u003ego version\r\ngo version go1.6.2 windows/amd64\r\n\r\n2.

What did you do?\r\n\r\nRan \"go vet\", producing mysterious results\r\n\r\nA tiny Go source file that demonstrates the issue (which I named \"vet_check.go\"):\r\n\r\n    package xxx\r\n\r\n    type XXX struct {\r\n        s string\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    func (xxx *XXX) Peek(length int) string {\r\n        return xxx.s\r\n    }\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nNo suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\n \u003ego tool vet \\junk\\vet_check.go\r\n \\junk\\vet_check.go:7: method Peek(length int) string should have signature Peek(int) ([]byte, error)\r\n\r\nIf the name of the method is changed from Peek to Peekx, problem goes away.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this problem with my test program isolated from all other Go source files, in its own directory, and the $GOPATH environment variable removed (wondering if there might have been interaction from other source files -- apparently not).",
