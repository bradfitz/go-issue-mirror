When\nthe process exits, and we've waited for it, Cmd.Wait waits for that goroutine to\ncomplete.  But there is really no reason to do that.  The process is done; it's not\ngoing to read any more data.  We shouldn't sit around waiting for the goroutine to copy\ndata to a process that isn't going to read it.  We should instead just tell the\ngoroutine to shut down.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **release-go1.4**._",
