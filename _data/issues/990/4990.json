Russ reminded me\nfor the third time:\n\n\u0026quot;memprofile dumps a profile of the memory at the end of the test. It's for seeing\nwhere memory goes statically. If you want to see the complete allocation history you can\nrun the test with GOGC=off. Or you can use a cpuprofile - usually the garbage\ncollections end up where the most common allocations are.\u0026quot;\n\nCarl said he wants profiling support for all allocations as well.\n\nFiling this for later.\u003c/pre\u003e",
