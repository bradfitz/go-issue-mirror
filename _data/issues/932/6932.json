	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eNew package debug/goobj supports the new cmd/nm and eventually the new cmd/ld. But\nshould it be in the standard tree? The argument in favor is that debug/elf, debug/macho,\ndebug/pe are all there, and it keeps the prereq for these commands in the tree. The\nargument against is that I probably wouldn't put any of them in the standard library if\nI were doing it again today.\n\nPerhaps debug/goobj can be put somewhere else in the main repo that is not the standard\ntree, or maybe it should be in a subrepo, or it is fine where it is. Decide.\u003c/pre\u003e",
