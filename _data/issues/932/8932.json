	"body": "by **bgarcia@golang.org**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n  In a running godoc instance, search for ParseDuration\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n  There should be a \u0026quot;Functions\u0026quot; heading at the top, with time.ParseDuration as a result within it.  Clicking that link should take you to the documentation for time.ParseDuration.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n  There is no link to the time.ParseDuration documentation.\n  Depending on the options that godoc was run with, you will see results with source code links under \u0026quot;Package-level declarations\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Local declarations and uses\u0026quot;.\n\n---\nThere are two factors that cause this condition to occur.\nFirst, the function in question returns a type defined in the same package.  Second, the\ntype being returned is defined in a different file from the function.\n\nIn the example above, time.ParseDuration is defined in time/format.go, while the\ntime.Duration type that it returns is defined in time/time.go.\n\n---\nWhen godoc parses files to index the documentation, it currently parses each file\nindividually.  When time/format.go is parsed, godoc does not have the definition of\ntime.Duration.  Because of this, time.ParseDuration is then thrown away when we attempt\nto treat its like the methods on a type (which we do for functions which look like\nconstructors).\n\nOne solution would be to index the documentation on a package level instead of a file\nlevel.\u003c/pre\u003e",
