FWIW, attached shows the difference btw Linux and OS X\nMavericks. On Linux, the unixgram writer will be blocked on write waiting for the far\nendpoint to read (I mean, EAGAIN). On Darwin, the writer will get \"no buffer space\navailable\" error eventually.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/5932/19/unixgram.go\"\u003eunixgram.go\u003c/a\u003e (1161 bytes)",
