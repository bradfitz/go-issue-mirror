Nevertheless, the repo is a very small one (two\nfiles, and 13 SLOCs)\n\n1. go get github.com/eatienza/gobug\n2. You should get the following message:\n\n# github.com/eatienza/gobug\nsrc/github.com/eatienza/gobug/parser.go:3: use of package strings not in selector\n\n3. the message should have been\nsrc/github.com/eatienza/gobug/generator.go:8: use of package strings not in selector\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using? linux, and the bug has been reproduced under\nwindows7\n\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version') 1.0.3\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThis is a very misleading error message:\nmajor: it does not point to the right file\nminor: the message itself is misleading. \u0026lt;\u0026lt;use of package \u0026quot;strings\u0026quot; not\nin selector\u0026gt;\u0026gt; would have been more helpful.\u003c/pre\u003e",
