I've tried searching\nquite a few times through every Go book I own, the golang.org site, as well as the\ngolang-nuts group and I couldn't find anything that mentioned anywhere that it wasn't\npossible to use a Go package with no source available.  It seems like this simple fact\nwould be mentioned somewhere?\nI fully expected to be able to have:\n$GOPATH/\n  pkg/arch/dummy.a\n  src/test/test.go\nhave test.go contain \nimport 'dummy'\nand have it work.   Instead it only works if all source for dummy is available in\nsrc/dummy.  What's even the point of having dummy.a then?\nGo requiring all source to always be available for all packages seems like a pretty\nsignificant requirement to mention somewhere, don't you think?\u003c/pre\u003e",
