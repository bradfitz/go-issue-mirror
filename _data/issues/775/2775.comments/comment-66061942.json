We have total control over the source directory tree that the\nstudents start out with, so we can basically use anything.  The limitations are that\nthey typically extract it from a tar file, we don't want to have to have them run any\nadditional commands (touch(1)'ing files), and we'd love it to work on a variety of\nplatforms and filesystems (many students run the code on AFS;  OSes used span the gamut,\netc).  That's why I point to the mtime hack as a bit too fragile for our environment.\n\nMy ideal solution would let us:\n  - Hand out *one* tarball that contains precompiled packages for multiple architectures;\n  - Assuming GOPATH is set properly, the students could simply import (\"foo\") and be able to use the package.\n\nWhat other information in particular would be useful to you as far as \"the best\nsolution\"?\u003c/pre\u003e",
