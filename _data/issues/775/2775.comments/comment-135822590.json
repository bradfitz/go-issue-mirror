Perhaps simply having an \"binary only\" package directory.  The .a files in that package directory would not require sources.  For example \"pkgbin\" or \"pgk/binary\".  A flag to go build could be used by the vendor to specify the destination should be the binary directory but it should rebuild from sources.",
