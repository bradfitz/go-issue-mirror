	"body": "I think this could be addressed very simply in a variety of ways.  Since I assume people want to keep the \"ignore any .a for which there are no .go files\" concept, we can define a way for the .go file to specify this.  Here are some example contents:\r\n\r\n    package foo\r\n\r\nIf foo.go is the only source file for package foo, and it only contains these two words, then do not rebuild the .a file.\r\n\r\n    package foo\r\n    //go:norebuild\r\n\r\nA directive to indicate the compiler should never rebuild this file.  This would let the .go file contain documentation, possibly even stub function definitions so godoc would continue to work.\r\n\r\nOr pick any other indicator.",
