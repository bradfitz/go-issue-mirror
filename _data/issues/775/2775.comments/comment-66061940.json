We tried several (hacky)\napproaches and none worked reliably enough for the class environment (we need to try the\nmtime hack again on AFS).  This meant that we had no way to hand out binary reference\ncode for the students to test against.  Nor could we hand out reference implementations\nfor students who couldn't get part of the project working.\" [2]\n\n[1]: \u003ca href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/15-440/F12/index.html\"\u003ehttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/15-440/F12/index.html\u003c/a\u003e\n[2]: \u003ca href=\"http://da-data.blogspot.se/2013/02/teaching-distributed-systems-in-go.html\"\u003ehttp://da-data.blogspot.se/2013/02/teaching-distributed-systems-in-go.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
