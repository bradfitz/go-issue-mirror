	"body": "I am working on namespacing the Linux integrity measurement architecture. Here a new IMA namespace will be created as part of the clone(). We intend to hook up a virtual TPM (TPM emulator) to the IMA namespace but have to do this after the clone() and before the execve(). The problem with the execve() is that it creates 'measurements' and these measurements will be extended into a PCR of the TPM emulator. So the hook-up of the vTPM with the IMA-namespace has to be done by the parent before the child executes the execve().\r\nI initially wrote 'callback' in the title but removed that. It likely would not work so well, so a synchronization primitive, such as two pipes, could be used to indicate to the parent that it can do its job and then indicate to the child that it can proceed. As stated, we would like to be able to execute code in the parent before the child runs the execve().\r\n",
