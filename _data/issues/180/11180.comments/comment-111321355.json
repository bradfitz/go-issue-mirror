The sigaction(2) [man page](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man2/sigaction.2.html) doesn't explicitly guarantee that open(2) won't return `EINTR`. If os.OpenFile is indeed intended to never return that error, it can't rely on such a guarantee, right?",
