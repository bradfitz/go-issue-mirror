	"body": "Both `cmd/go/discovery.go` and `tools/go/vcs/discovery.go` contain what used to be an identical copy of `parseMetaGoImports`.\r\n\r\n[CL 68520044](https://codereview.appspot.com/68520044) has applied a bug fix to the `parseMetaGoImports` copy in `cmd/go`, but not in `tools/go/vcs`. Because of that, there is now a difference between the two copies:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1924134/5690473/43f86072-9840-11e4-872b-65d7bbd3d788.png)\r\n\r\nTherefore, the bug is still present in `tools/go/vcs` package but not `cmd/go`. It manifests itself in that you can do `go get -d -u robpike.io/filter` and it will succeed, but doing `vcs.RepoRootForImportPath(\"robpike.io/filter\", false)` results in an error `unrecognized import path \"robpike.io/filter\"`. It was originally discovered in https://github.com/shurcooL/gtdo/issues/26.\r\n\r\nThe fix is really simple - just apply the same change as in [CL 68520044](https://codereview.appspot.com/68520044) to `tools/go/vcs`.",
