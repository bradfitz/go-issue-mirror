But dates as encoded in JSON\noften are not.\n\nThe easiest way to get a Google API to give you a non-RFC3339 date is to insert a file\nusing the Drive API with a modifiedDate outside of the RFC3339 range. Perhaps the API\nshould have been written to disallow such dates, but it does not, and will happily\nreturn the values that you entered.\n\nIt would not be such a big deal to fail non-RFC3339 dates with a parse error, except\nthat through various means, you'll get giant JSON objects containing a listing of\nhundreds of files, and one invalid date will invalidate the entire listing. Worse, files\nwith such dates can be caused to appear in your JSON responses by arbitrary third\nparties. (I can share a file with a crazy date with you, and cause you to get a parse\nerror if you cannot understand it.) This is a kind of denial of service.\u003c/pre\u003e",
