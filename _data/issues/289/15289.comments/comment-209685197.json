	"body": "@RonDrabkin Can you elaborate on why new Go programmers may think `sum` is an operator? E.g., are there other common programming languages where it's an operator and/or can't be used as a variable name?  How widespread is this expectation?  Off hand, I'm not familiar with any such language.\r\n\r\nAs @ianlancetaylor points out, Go does not have name-like operators; only name-like keywords.  And `sum` is an idiomatic variable name in Go.",
