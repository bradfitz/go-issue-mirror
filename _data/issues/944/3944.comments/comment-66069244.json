Some new method on IPConn that returns a new IPConn with a \"wantGoodBehavior\nbool\" set true?\n\nGross, but I don't see how else to fix this safely, without breaking old users.\n\nOr are old users completely busted anyway?  That's what nobody understood before, and\nwhy this didn't go into 1.1.\u003c/pre\u003e",
