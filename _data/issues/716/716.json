Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Perform a http.Get (or just the http.ReadResponse part of it) against a server that\nreturns a (a) \nHTTP/1.1 response, with (b) no Content-Length header and (c) doesn't use\nTransfer-Encoding: \nchunked.\n2. Observe that the response Body does not, in fact, contain the body.\n\n\nFeel free to ping me out-of-band for a more concrete example. I *think* the response is\nvalid \nHTTP/1.1 (I haven't verified yet), and a cursory look at the code seems to imply this\narea is a bit \nsketchy.\u003c/pre\u003e",
