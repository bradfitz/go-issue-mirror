	"body": "by **brady**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIdeally I would like to be able to add callbacks to the flags library that get called\nafter all the flags have been parsed, but before flags.Parse() returns. This would give\na library which uses flags the ability to check complicated argument's in a way that\nstill returns an \u0026quot;error\u0026quot; in the flag parsing step of the main application.\n\nA basic example of the concept: a library accepts two arguments, \u0026quot;-stdout\u0026quot; or\n\u0026quot;-quiet\u0026quot;. Use of both flags is an error to the library. I can either do the\nargument processing the first time a call into the library is made which cause cause a\nstrange error path to the user (\u0026quot;it ran for 4 minutes they barfed out an argument\nerror!\u0026quot;). Alternatively the main function can be littered with initLibraryX(),\ninitLibraryY() like calls after the flag parsing but before execution.\n\nWith a callback in flag it would be possible to return a flag error at parse time\nwithout intrusion into main by every library included. It also becomes possible to\ninitialize libraries like complex logging from the flags before the first call is made.\u003c/pre\u003e",
