It doesn't explicitly specify \"cmd\" but apparently it ends up invoking it anyway\nin some cases.\n\nIt happens because that is how Windows CreateProcess works. I said it before, I am\nrepeating it again. Whatever Windows CreateProcess does cannot be \"wrong\". Can it?\n\n\u003e ... as a batch file. ...\n\nSure. But that is how Windows CreateProcess treats batch files. If you have problem with\nthat, you should take it up with Microsoft.\n\nI wouldn't use batch files to invoke Mercurial anyway. Batch files are trouble at times.\nFor example, can you determine if Mercurial command has failed or not, if you are\ncalling it via batch file?\n\n\u003e ... In #2 I also provided a minimal example showing that invoking a .bat file using\nexec.Start causes cmd.exe in cwd (rather than %ComSpec%) to be used for invoking the\nbatch file.\n\nSame as above.\n\n\u003e ... My biggest concern is that it may be possible to create a repository that exploits\nthis and makes go get invoke arbitrary code in some cases. (I can try to create one if\nthat is what it takes for this to be accepted as an issue.)\n\n\"go get\" does not execute code that is not *installed* by you. Does it?\n\nFeel free to create a new issue if you like. Alternatively, I am happy to reopen this\nissue, if you insist. I just don't understand what you expect us to do. Perhaps other\ngophers do. Sorry.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
