(I originally had hg.exe on Path; in that\ncase hg.exe is invoked directly, without involving cmd, so the issue is not triggered.)\n\nI believe that always using %Comspec% /c hg should still resolve the issue, but ideally\nthere should be a solution that fixes just the problematic case (with .bat files), so\nI'm looking into the mechanism in more detail.\u003c/pre\u003e",
