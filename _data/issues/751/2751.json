What do you see instead?\ngodoc shows interface type like following:\n\ntype io.Closer interface {\n    Close() error\n}\n    Closer is the interface that wraps the basic Close method.\n\ntype io.Reader interface {\n    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n}\n    Reader is the interface that wraps the basic Read method.\n\ntype io.Writer interface {\n    Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n}\n    Writer is the interface that wraps the basic Write method.\n\ntype net.Addr interface {\n    :\n}\n    Addr represents a network end point address.\n\nPlease use labels and text to provide additional information.\nI think it would be nice, be helpful for writing Go program \nif godoc could show cross-cutting catalogue for of interface \ntype.\u003c/pre\u003e",
