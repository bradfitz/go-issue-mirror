Also, all\nidentifiers in the source will be links to their definitions.\n\nIf you run with -analysis=type,pointer, you'll see even more information: intra-package\ncall graph in the package docs, and callers/callees and channel peers in the source\nview.  This is currently rather slow (a couple of minutes).\n\nThe -analysis flag is just a technology demonstration at the moment; more work is\nrequired to polish the user experience.  Feel free to contact me if you have questions\nor bug reports.\n\n(For the record: the \"oracle\" refers just to the command-line wrapper around the type\nand pointer analysis libraries.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
