If this sounds like a bad idea, it is. So I wrote a simple DLL in C++ for\nthe COM stuff and exported the relevant functions. ...\n\nI would like to see what you are trying to do. You can provide a C program, if you like.\nI am interested to see, if I can convert it into pure Go. Just for fun. When I have\ntime. Thank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
