I don't\nknow why, so we have to resolve that. ...\". It appears the test fails with \"deadlock\"\nmessage, so we need to rearrange scheduler somewhat before we can apply this patch.\n\nI didn't push for it, because I don't have anyone complaining about it. Perhaps, if it\nis important to you, you could tell us what your difficulty is. Maybe that will convince\nsomeone to put some actual effort into it. Thank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
