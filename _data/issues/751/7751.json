	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCurrently the parsing of the values for the cookie attributes\nDomain, Path, Secure, Max-Age, Expires and HttpOnly is too lax:\n1. Quoted values are unquoted (which is okay for the cookie-value\nitself, but not for the attribute values according to RFC 6265)\n2. All values are parsed with basically the full set of allowed\ncharacters.\n\nPoint 2 might be overkill, but there is no need to unquote\nas browsers do not handle quoted attribute values.\n\nAs the infrastructure for restricted set of characters is\nalready in place with func parseCookieValueUsing(...) it\nmight be worth to allow only '0' to '9' while parsing Max-Age\nand fail early (now malformed values fail in strconv.Atoi)\u003c/pre\u003e",
