That said, I have been told that the Adobe Reader browser plugin, among others, is vulnerable to attacks when the user can control parts of the error message (which happens when the Go error string quotes part of the user's input).  This is true even with the Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options headers, as the browser plugin apparently ignores those headers.",
