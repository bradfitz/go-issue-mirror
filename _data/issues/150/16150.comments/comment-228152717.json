	"body": "Thanks for looking into this.\r\n\r\n\u003e With gcc it works, probably because gcc uses asan runtime in shared library. But nothing good should come up out of this.\r\n\u003e Darwin can also use asan runtime in a shared library.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the [matrix I've been using](https://github.com/keroserene/go-webrtc/blob/master/.travis.yml), it's gcc on linux and clang on darwin. Guess that's why I didn't see the duplicate symbols failures.\r\n\r\n\u003e Without -race it seems to work. I run the test 12'000 times without failures.\r\n\r\nAbove I said I've only seen this with clang. I should have specified further, clang on darwin. Is that where you ran your tests?\r\n\r\nI made [this commit](https://github.com/keroserene/go-webrtc/commit/be729a96a526463ad8e9726f72fa5adf8095ca55) yesterday to separate the asan and tsan runs. But, I'm still seeing it on occasion, both locally and in CI.\r\n\r\n",
