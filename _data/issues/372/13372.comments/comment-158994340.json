We have a few free list corruption reports, but yours seems by far the most reproducible and most likely to lead to a fix.\r\n\r\nAlso, what OS/architecture is this?\r\n\r\nIf it's easy, I'd be curious if you can reproduce this with the latest code from the master branch. I don't think we've fixed anything that would obviously have caused this, but if it *is* fixed on master, we can bisect it and probably narrow right in on the problem without you having to share your code.",
