We do not\nhave a handle on it although some changes involving the madvise system call have reduced\nits frequency.\n\nMy uninformed opinion is that it is either a kernel bug in FreeBSD or the Go\nimplementation stumbling over an inconsistency between FreeBSD and the other Unix\nimplementations.\n\nIf you look into the problem, you'll see it's all but inconceivable that this error can\narise. An address becomes invalid in a situation where that truly cannot happen.\n\nWe need more reproducible examples or fewer FreeBSDs.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **os-freebsd**, **priority-someday**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
