	"body": "`docker -v` works only on Linux and silently fails if you run a docker client on a non-Linux machine. It creates confusion for those who are using the following command as instructed as on the README to build their packages.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -v $GOPATH/src:/src mobile /bin/bash -c 'cd /src/your/project \u0026\u0026 ./make.bash'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should copy the package to be built and its dependencies from the host to the container. But, Docker provides no additional tools to help us with this issue.\r\n\r\nOne alternative is to vendor the dependencies and use ONBUILD ADD to build an app builder image. It will only work if all dependencies are vendored under the Dockerfile's directory, because Docker rejects to add files from outer contexts. https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#add\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM mobile:latest\r\n\r\nONBUILD ADD . /src/your/project/\r\n\r\nRUN cd /src/your/project/ \u0026\u0026 ./all.bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the user can do a docker cp to retrieve the apk.",
