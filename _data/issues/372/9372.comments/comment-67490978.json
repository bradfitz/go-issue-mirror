	"body": "To add to what @hyangah wrote, the current workflow is extremely convenient. I work with an app on my desktop in my normal GOPATH, where I can build and run it. Then I use a single command to build an .apk of the same program. Any replacement for the existing docker setup needs to replicate that. I'm open to any solution for features like concurrent and remote builds, as long as it can also do that.\r\n\r\nOf more interest is getting rid of the android-related junk. In particular, AndroidManifest.xml, build.xml, jni/Android.mk, etc should all be derivable for normal apps. @adg's experiments with mobiley are about getting rid of that burden, which would help the developer experience. It will become more important when building for other platforms is supported, as those will require a different set of build junk and a tool should keep them in sync (ideally by automatically generating them) for the common case.",
