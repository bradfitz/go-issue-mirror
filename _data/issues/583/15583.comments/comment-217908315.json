	"body": "I agree with @minux that almost all real programs will bring in fmt anyway and you should first understand why fmt compiles to such large GopherJS output code first.\r\n\r\nThe other possibility is modify the GopherJS compiler to replace fmt.Errorf with a lighter work-alike. But that's kinda fixing the wrong problem.\r\n\r\nI don't want to start making every package depending on fmt have its own fmt-like \"minimal\" versions. That would mean that in a real program we'd have both the actual fmt implementation as well as all the \"minimal\" fmt clones, making the size problem even worse.\r\n\r\nI'd rather just see the linkers (Go and GopherJS's) fixed to do more dead code elimination, if that's the issue. (sometimes unnecessary generated init funcs pin things that might not otherwise be needed).\r\n\r\nBut if it turns out that a perfect linker couldn't dead-code eliminate something (perhaps because the code paths to take depend on the Errorf format string), perhaps only then could we change something to give the linker more information. But only if it helps significantly.",
