	"body": "The other benefit to fewer dependencies is that the dependency graph is sparser, so more things can be compiled concurrently. This applies whether or not the code uses `fmt` somewhere else. The go command is not as good at taking advantage of this now as it could be, but I hope that that will improve next cycle.\r\n\r\nI think the patch could be made nicer by introducing local functions `errorf` and `errorf2` (naming improvements welcome), at which point the patch is basically `s/fmt.Errorf/errorf/` or `s/fmt.Errorf/errorf2` as appropriate.",
