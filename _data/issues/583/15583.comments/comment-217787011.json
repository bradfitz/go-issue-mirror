I don't buy it.\n\nIf they're all like `encoding/json` and a little effort could strip it, then why not incrementally decouple the stdlib and remove it?\n\nI've just stripped `encoding/xml`, and it was harder. Formatting was used more often for quoting and interface conversions. But even then, the types and formats were all the same; string, int, and interface.Type. The full power of `fmt` was not warranted, merely a helper that would convert and concatenate variadic simply types.\n\nOn 8 May 2016 23:33:31 IST, Minux Ma \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003efmt is not only about user output.\n\u003e\n\u003eOf the 155 std packages, 83 of them uses fmt.\n\u003ePretty much all io related packages (net, net/http,\n\u003eos/user, log) use fmt, so I will be very surprised\n\u003eto learn some useful Go application that doesn't\n\u003euse fmt at all.\n\u003e\n\u003eBasically, the only way such a program can interact\n\u003ewith the outside world without fmt package is via\n\u003ethe syscall and os packages.\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e---\n\u003eYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n\u003eReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n\u003ehttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/15583#issuecomment-217750266\n\n-- \nSent from my Android device with K-9 Mail.
