The only thing\nthat looks suspicious in your setup is your GOTOOLDIR value - mine is\nGOTOOLDIR=c:\\go\\pkg\\tool\\windows_386.\n\nThe only good suggestion I have is for you to look at gotour program itself, to see\nwhere and why it breaks. You should be able to put print statements to make sure all\ncode is executed as expected.\n\nLeaving it for others.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
