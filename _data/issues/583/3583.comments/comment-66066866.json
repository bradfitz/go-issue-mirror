This new executable worked\nfine for me.\n\nI don't know if the other one, placed in C:\\Go\\bin\\gotour.exe after \"go get\ncode.google.com/p/go-tour/gotour\", is and older version. But it's existence in that\nfolder confounded me, as it didn't work.\n\nI know my english is not so good, so if you need any clarification, I can try to write\nit out. xD\u003c/pre\u003e",
