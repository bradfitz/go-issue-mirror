	"body": "I keep having little idea for Go github automation, but I don't do it because I don't want to run a new server (lazy).\r\n\r\nBut I realize we already have cmd/pushback running with Github API access, so perhaps we turn cmd/pushback into the general gopherbot server and put more stuff in there?\r\n\r\ne.g. I'd like a way to assign issues to people who aren't yet a member of our \"go-assignees\" Team. Perhaps I could summon @gopherbot to do it for me, like:\r\n\r\n\"Yo @gopherbot, assign @xxxxxxxxxx\"\r\n\r\nAnd gopherbot would manage both the process of inviting them to the team, awaiting the invite, and then doing the github issue assignment.\r\n\r\n@adg, thoughts?\r\n",
