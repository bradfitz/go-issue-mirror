I know that it's possible to transfer bytes into ISO-2022-JP by golang.org/x/text/encoding/japanese, but we can't make quoted printable string by go package. (I know it's not difficult to make quoted-printable string, but i want official package)\r\nDo you have a plan to make public APIs for quoted-printable?\r\n",
