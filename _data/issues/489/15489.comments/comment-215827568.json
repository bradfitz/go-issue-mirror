The failure is because the -X flag expects two arguments: a variable name and a value. However, you're only providing a variable name, followed by another -X flag.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the `git rev-parse HEAD` invocation (from https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/devel/mongo-tools/files/patch-build.sh.diff?rev=148181)  is yielding an empty string. \r\n\r\nThe only issue on Go's side is that it emits the warning even if the -X flag was invalid to begin with.",
