	"body": "Go 1.7 is introducing a new very fast compressor that can be selected through the `flate.HuffmanOnly` constant.\r\n\r\nI find the name suboptimal:\r\n\r\n * The other compressions levels are called `NoCompression`, `BestSpeed`, `BestCompression`, `DefaultCompression`. None of the cite specific algorithm names. For instance, there is no `Snappy` constant to select the Snappy algorithm (that is instead called through the `BestSpeed` constant).\r\n * If you're not aware of the inners of the gzip compressor, you cannot know what `HuffmanOnly` implies. The `Only` word can hint at the fact that only a portion of the algorithm is being run, and you could assume that this means more speed and less ratio, but it's not immediately clear. The inline help also is very technical (`Disables match search and only does Huffman entropy reduction`).\r\n * When I ran an informal poll between colleagues, making them read the klauspost gzip repository's README, many were worried that the modifications would alter the DEFLATE bitstream compatibility. This produced https://github.com/klauspost/compress/pull/46. I worry that `HuffmanOnly` might raise the same concerns. Compatibility with the DEFLATE bitstream is clarified in the release notes, but not in the documentation. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to change the constant to a name which better describes the results achieved rather than the algorithm used. I personally like `MaxSpeed`, but anything would go.",
