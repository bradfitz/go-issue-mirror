	"body": "@bradfitz Excellent. Related, I'd want the net/http code examples in overview to reflect more real usage. Namely, the examples suggest using \u0026http.Transport{...} but leave out any mentions of e.g. MaxIdleConns etc. that are part of DefaultTransport. Should the examples suggest copying DefaultTransport then or do we need a NewTransport that gives a copy of default transport sensible settings, including HTTP/2 and idle connection limit?\r\n\r\nI've been bitten by getting default zero values following the example, as zero value is different from ones from DefaultTransport. This may be fixable with a doc-only change. The doc should reflect best practice.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want me to create another issue for this or if it's basically the same thing.",
