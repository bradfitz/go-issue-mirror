	"body": "Thanks for the test case.  Your code has a number of race conditions.  The one on the global variable \"list\" in server.go looks particularly serious.  One goroutine is appending values to list  while a different goroutine is iterating over it.  Your first step in analyzing this problem has to be to remove all these race conditions.  You should see them if you build and run your programs with the -race option.  See http://blog.golang.org/race-detector for background on the race detector.",
