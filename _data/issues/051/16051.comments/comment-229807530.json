That will shrink the set of programs which need solution (2). However (1) will always leave performance on the floor because it has to do extra work to handle not well-behaved C calls. \r\n\r\nNow maybe CGO can be sped up enough that the performance difference is so small that the set of programs that would benefit from (2) is too small to be worth the effort of implementing and maintaining it. Or maybe it is deemed too dangerous to be used correctly - but then I question why the Go runtime uses it for the race detector.",
