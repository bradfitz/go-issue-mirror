	"body": "@eloff, there's been some discussion (though no concrete proposals to my knowledge) to add functions for things like popcount and bsr that would be compiled as intrinsics where supported (like math.Sqrt is today). With 1.7 we're trying this out in the runtime, which now has a ctz intrinsic available to it on amd64 SSA. Obviously that doesn't solve the overall problem, but it would chip away at one more reason to use cgo in a low-overhead context.",
