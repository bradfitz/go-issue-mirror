	"body": "Basically, the main problem is that calling C functions from Go is slow, and has only become slower. This unfortunately makes Go less suitable for graphical applications and games that have to call into a C OpenGL or Vulkan API many times per second. I don't have any great ideas on how to solve this problem, but I insist that it is something that needs to be improved.",
