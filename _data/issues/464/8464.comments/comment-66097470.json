The definition of ParseFiles says that the\ntemplate is named for the base name of the first file.  If you want to be able to handle\nmultiple templates with the same base name, don't use ParseFiles.  I don't see how we\ncan change this behaviour without breaking the backward compatibility guarantee.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
