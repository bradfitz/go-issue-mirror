The last field in the\r\n    record must not be followed by a comma.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, the ABNF grammar in [section 2.7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180#page-3) also seems to indicate that delimiters are not a part of the field.\r\n\r\nIf delimiters are not a part of the field then (IMO) the correct parsing of a CSV row would be to scan until a delimiter is found, eating any white space iff the setting is toggled and the white space is not a delimiter.\r\n\r\n(And yes, I know using tabs inside a CSV is icky but running `sed 's#\\t#,#g' in \u003e out` on the huge CSV files I have to deal with is impractical and could lose data; other programs are slow/impractical as well.)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
