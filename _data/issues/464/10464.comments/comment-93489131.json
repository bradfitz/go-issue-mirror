I thought the references would be useful.\r\n\r\nAlthough the TOC is located correctly and can be read, the offsets that are stored in the directory structure are assumed to be relative to the front of the file. This means that when you actually try to read the data you're hitting the incorrect part of the underling file since there are additional bytes at the font that aren't considered.\r\n\r\nThe suggested fix works out the size of these additional bytes and then includes them when reading directory entries and file content.",
