I added a testcase that appeared to fail before starting.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth considering that in this particular case, the size of the prefixed bytes isn't known until you read the zip central directory record. This means that an equivalent `withOffset` reader method wouldn't be particularly useful for most people since they would need to duplicate the code that reads the central directory end record.",
