Agreed, this would\nbe a.b.Check()\nbut here what we've got is a.b.c.Check() where b (in the middle) is nil.\n\nin the Check method, the receiver address is 0x0c ( apparently offset of c in B struct),\nobviously not nil. There is no way to check that this address is correct (any attempt to\ndereference it leads to a panic)\u003c/pre\u003e",
