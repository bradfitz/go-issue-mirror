	"body": "Setting the `TrimLeadingSpace` field causes the parser to eat all the white space, including field delimiters.\r\n\r\nExample: https://play.golang.org/p/zw76XV6YIb\r\n\r\nOn one hand this seems like well-defined behavior -- the option causes the parser to do what it's supposed to: eat white space. On the other, one would assume that a field's delimiter is not a part of the field -- it's a separator that demarcates two fields.\r\n\r\nRight now the docs say:\r\n\r\n`If TrimLeadingSpace is true, leading white space in a field is ignored.`\r\n\r\nSince I assume changing the behavior of the CSV parser isn't backwards compatible, I think it'd be beneficial to add to the documentation with something like:\r\n\r\n`If TrimLeadingSpace is true, leading white space in a field is ignored. If the delimiter is white space then TrimLeadingSpace will trim the delimiter.`\r\n\r\n(Perhaps it'll save some of us who like to program while tired some grief in the future.)",
