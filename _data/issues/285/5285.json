	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe function t.Parallel() does not pause the internal timer, so the time that it takes\nfor the test case to get scheduled gets counted in that test's execution time. \n\nOptions:\n1) This can be fixed by moving the StopTimer stuff from testing.B to testing.common, and\nusing those functions inside t.Parallel to stop the timer before doing the chan ops, and\nstarting the timer again afterwards.\n\n2) Manually pause and resume the timer by messing around with the start time in\nt.Parallel\u003c/pre\u003e",
