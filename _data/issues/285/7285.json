	"body": "by **czarek.tomczak**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eHi there,\n\nRecently I've added some simple test to my Go app and it resulted in the build process\ntime extending from 1sec to 5secs. This is not acceptable, I want to run unit tests\noften so that bugs are detected early. And if it takes so much time to run them, then it\ndiscourages to run them at all.\n\nWhen running \u0026quot;go build\u0026quot; the installed package is used (which is up-to-date).\nBut when running \u0026quot;go test\u0026quot; it seems that Go recompiles the whole package,\ndespite fact that it is already installed and up to date. \n\nThis is my file structure:\n\n   cef/cef.go\n   cef/cef_test.go\n\ncef package is installed. Running \u0026quot;go test cef\u0026quot;. The GOPATH is set correctly.\nWhen running \u0026quot;go build\u0026quot; it detects the installed package fine.\n\n\nMy solution was to put the tests in a separate package \u0026quot;cef_test\u0026quot;:\n\n   cef_test/cef_test.go\n\nAnd then run test only for that file:\n\n   go test src/tests/cef_test.go\n\nThat way running the test takes only 0.225 sec.\n\nBut it smells bad to do it this way. If we could have a command line flag that does not\nforce recompiling of up-to-date packages that would be great.\n\nMy build script looks like this:\n\n    set GOPATH=%~dp0\n    go install cef\n    go install wingui\n    go test src/tests/cef_test.go\n    go build -o Release/cef2go.exe src/main_win.go\n\nThe cef package takes long to compile, because it uses import \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;, see the\nsource here:\n\n    \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/CzarekTomczak/cef2go/blob/605bb6ab98654831d756b36db6127a7f43bb4811/src/cef/cef.go\"\u003ehttps://github.com/CzarekTomczak/cef2go/blob/605bb6ab98654831d756b36db6127a7f43bb4811/src/cef/cef.go\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThank you for taking a look at this issue.\n\nBest regards,\nCzarek\u003c/pre\u003e",
