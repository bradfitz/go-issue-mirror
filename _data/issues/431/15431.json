	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo1.6.2\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\ndarwin/amd64 (Mac OS/X 10.11.4)\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/D5so_L8JDD\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nAt the very least, all available parts successfully read before the reader hangs on more data from the socket. In this particular example the multipart reader can even reach \"EOF\" because once it reaches the postamble, it's impossible for there to be any more parts.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nThe multipart reader hangs before even reading the first part. Presumably because it's trying to peek ahead but the socket doesn't have enough data available for the peek buffer.",
