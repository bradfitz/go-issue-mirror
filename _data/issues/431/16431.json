	"body": "Currently the release dashboard only respects \"R=go1.8\" in replies to Gerrit CLs. It should also recognize this marker in the commit message.\r\n\r\nPeople clearly expect this to happen. For example: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/24818/ and https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/24901/. Putting it in the commit message would also be more convenient than replying to your own CL if you're uploading a CL that's meant for the next release.",
