We use undocumented way to fetch time, but it is monotonic as far as I know. @dvyukov to confirm.\r\n\r\nI don't think we return monotonic time from time.Now on windows. This would be a bug, because time.Now should return system time which can be changed by user.\r\nThe shared page contains InterruptTime, this time is monotonic and we use it for runtime.nanotime; and SystemTime, this time is not monotonic and we use for time.Now.\r\n",
