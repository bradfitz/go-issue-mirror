On a well-run system, time _does_ only move forward and at a constant (enough) pace.\n\n\u003e When you see the large impact that things such as leap seconds have (including at Google), it's easy to see this is a well known problem but also a recurring problem.\n\nI don't understand this comment. Leap seconds [don't](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/time-technology-and-leaping-seconds.html) [exist](https://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2015/05/Got-a-second-A-leap-second-that-is-Be-ready-for-June-30th.html) at Google.\n\nIt is true that if you use time.Now to measure time during a leap smear then your measurements may be off by approximately 0.001%. But time will still be monotonic.",
