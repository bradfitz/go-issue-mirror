	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eNothing in package runtime looks at the Go 'symtab' symbol anymore. Move it into\nunmapped memory, so that it is still in the file for debuggers but not mapped while the\nprogram runs.\n\nLow priority, since the size of the file will not be changing, and since the data is\nnever paged in, the total memory cost is under two pages of memory partially used by\nfragmentation, so less than 8 kB.\u003c/pre\u003e",
