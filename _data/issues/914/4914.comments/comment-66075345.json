Right after submission\nthere's a comment saying:\n\n    This code breaks Client.Get() on non-persistent (\"Connection: close\")\n    connections. Response.Body returns error(\"use of closed network\nconnection\").\n\nAnd a patch to fix that immediately followed in a different CL:\n\n    \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/6211069\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/6211069\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThat didn't make into the Debian package for several months, which means http GETs have\nbeen broken there and in Ubuntu for that time.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Fixed**._",
