I don't want to think about them in my day-to-day\nhacking - part of the point was to speed the builds -  and I am\nhappy to fix them after the fact.  Remember that we're not breaking\nthem for Go 1 users: we're breaking them for people living\nat Go tip, who should expect breakages anyway.\n\nWe have a TODO to gather a collection of external code that\nwill form a Go 1 compatibility suite.  Maybe the right thing is\nto make those the initial members of that suite.  If you had a\nfile listing go command package patterns, say external.txt\n\n    code.google.com/p/go.crypto/...\n    code.google.com/p/go.net/...\n    \u0026c\n\nthen external.bash can be just\n\n    go get $(cat external.txt)\n    go test $(cat external.txt)\n\n(I plan to make patterns work in go get.)\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
