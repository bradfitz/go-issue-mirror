There is a workaround of creating a custom Director that looks at the RequestURI and performs the correct parsing and escaping, populating the req.URL.Opaque and draining the req.URL.Path, but it would be better for the std library to do the right thing. Code that relies on the current escaping behavior is wrong, so I do not believe that fixing this would violate the stability guarantee.\n\n  This violates the http spec: rfc3986 ยง2.2 Reserved Characters\n   \n  The purpose of reserved characters is to provide a set of delimiting characters that are distinguishable from other data within a URI. URIs that differ in the replacement of a reserved character with its corresponding percent-encoded octet are not equivalent. Percent-encoding a reserved character, or decoding a percent-encoded octet that corresponds to a reserved character, will change how the URI is interpreted by most applications.  Thus, characters in the reserved set are protected from normalization and are therefore safe to be used by scheme-specific and producer-specific algorithms for delimiting data subcomponents within a URI.\u003c/pre\u003e",
