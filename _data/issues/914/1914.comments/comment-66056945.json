Try linking with 6l -a and grep the output for\nLEAQ.*SP.\n\nMost LEAQ n(SP), R (for any register R) are indicative of a problem to be fixed.  The\nmost common pattern is\n\nLEAQ 10(SP), AX\nMOVQ x, 0(AX)\nMOVQ y, 4(AX)\n\nand also with the moves going the other way.  These should just use 10(SP) and 14(SP)\nand avoid the LEAQ, which will registerize better.\u003c/pre\u003e",
