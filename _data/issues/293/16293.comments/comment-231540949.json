You mentioned that there's a large map, so my guess is that one of the mutator assists (handleConn in the screenshot you posted) is grabbing that and spending a long time scanning it. That would also be consistent with just one of the requests being delayed per GC, and sometimes no request being delayed (if the background worker was the one to grab the map).\r\n\r\n\u003e 2016/07/06 18:35:09 pacer: assist ratio=+8.551347e-003 (scan 81 MB in 9720-\u003e19297 MB) workers=2+0\r\n\r\nJust checking: is the vast majority of your heap non-pointer data? What's the type of your map? It's also a little weird it took a whole second to scan just 81 MB of pointer data...",
