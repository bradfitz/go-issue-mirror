	"body": "@ianlancetaylor I have a basic question. How to analyse the runtime stack? For example, my Go code is `fmt.Print(\"address\", svc.maps)`,  and the runtime stack is `fmt.Print(0xc8202bfe78, 0x2, 0x2, 0x4d5d00, 0x0, 0x0)`. How to make the connections between them? As I am thinking why you said that `C is returning the value 0x20`.\r\nBasically, I have printed the address of the value which allocated by `malloc`. This address is -603977536. which I think is correct( is not 0x20)\r\nSo, I think that we still do not find the problem.",
