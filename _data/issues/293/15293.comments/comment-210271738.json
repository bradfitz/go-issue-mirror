	"body": "The stack trace shows that a value that Go thinks should hold a pointer actually holds the value 0x20, which is not a valid pointer value.  That is why the Go runtime is crashing.\r\n\r\nMy first guess would be memory corruption.  But it is also possible that you are using a Go pointer to hold a value returned from C, and for some reason C is returning the value 0x20.  That could cause this problem.",
