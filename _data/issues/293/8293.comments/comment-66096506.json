The GC put the memory on the freelist, but then the memory\nwas changed by the program, breaking the freelist.  Some steps to help verify that would\nbe to print out j, so you know what iteration the program is on, and run the program\nwith GODEBUG=gctrace=2.\n\nAlso, compile the program with \"go build -gcflags=-live\" and attach the output here.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-main**, **release-go1.3.1**._",
