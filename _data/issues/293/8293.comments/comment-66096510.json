An int64 is not enough to hold two words on amd64, so the\nkernel is probably writing past the end of dest in the call. That next word is the first\nword of the next block, which is link pointer for the linked list of free blocks, if the\nblock is itself free. That explains what you are seeing. It sounds like you just need to\nmake VARIANT bigger, although it is not clear to me how big.\u003c/pre\u003e",
