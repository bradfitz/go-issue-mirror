Never mind.\r\n\r\nQuery could check args to see if any of them are sql.NamesParams and if so then assert for a NamedQueryer interface that looks like this:\r\n```go\r\ntype NamedQueryer interface {\r\n        NamedQuery(query string, args []Value, namedArgs []NamedValue) (Rows, error)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nStmt would also need to handle named params as well right? And it handles args in a very different way (the code I was reading).",
