What needs to counting the index is the database driver, and that doesn't need to do sql parsing or string substitution. What really need to parse the sql is your database server, and it is nature for it to do the name\u003c-\u003eindex mapping.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nTechnically, current driver can already support named parameter using the current stdlib api. It can use positional binding internally, but give a named binding interface to user, with all the benefit you mention of named binding and without any downside like string substitution. The go-oci8 driver shows that, and I just list the reasonings behind it.",
