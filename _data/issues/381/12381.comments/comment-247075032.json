	"body": "@kardianos Thanks, now I can see your reason is to want to just change the query string without changing the the parameter order. Because from your other examples, I didn't notice this before.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nTo be clarify for others, the intention for this issue, is not just support named placeholders in query string, which can already be done with the current api, but also support passing in parameters by name, so that their ordering become irrelevant.\r\n\r\nThe later part could be useful for queries that have large number of placeholders or their placeholders' position will chaning dynamically. This might need a new api in stdlib.",
