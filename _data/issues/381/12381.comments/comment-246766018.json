Variable `id` and `amount` maps to `:ID` and `:Amount`, and database server will use `:ID` and `:Amount` for error messages.\r\n\r\nAnd as I said, you can always use custom type for more syntax surgar if you want, which will not further improve error messages from database servers, maybe it could improve driver error messages if driver also does some sql parsing.",
