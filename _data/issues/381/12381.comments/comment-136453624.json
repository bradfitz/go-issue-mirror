	"body": "@kostya-sh Regarding adding named parameters, you hit the nail on the head. Named parameters for drivers needs to be optional, if it was supported. However sometimes you don't need a full SQL parser for things like this correctly. For example MS SQL Server has a \"go\" keyword that isn't part of T-SQL, but is rather a common client extension that separates out SQL batches. Supporting that required a simpler parser: https://bitbucket.org/kardianos/rdb/src/3240fb22ca61727b4604fae0c541737c1e1e26eb/ms/batch/batch_test.go?at=default \r\n\r\nBut you are correct, it would be non-trivial to do correctly even in the best of cases. I don't deny that.\r\n",
