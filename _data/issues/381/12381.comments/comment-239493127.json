We could alternate DB.Query(query, \"ID\", 5, \"Name\", \"Dreaming\"), but I don't think that could work as that would be API breaking (different meaning, no way to differentiate).\r\n\r\nDriver interfaces would need to be updated as well. Having a Param type would solve specifying an input type and specifying output parameters as well.\r\n\r\n@bradfitz If methods were added to support the context param, I would support (1). Any opinion on this?",
