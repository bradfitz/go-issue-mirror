I'm aware they don't support named parameters even when the underlying database protocols do, then when the higher abstractions add back in parameters through substitution we get even more inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nA few years back I had to access a database from go through ODBC as part of a warranty registration process:\r\n```\r\nexec warr.pr_api_WarrantyRegister ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?,      ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?,   ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?,    ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?,   ?\r\n```\r\nOver the years I have both added and removed parameters from this call, each time it is a counting game.\r\n\r\nAll that to say, I would prefer to survey database protocols rather then other abstractions.\r\n",
