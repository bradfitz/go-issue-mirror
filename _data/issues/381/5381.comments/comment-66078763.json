It's pretty easy to work\naround[1], and sort out the chunked encoding behavior, etc.\n\nI think it makes sense to have some basic logic in Response.Write to decide when to send\nthe Content-Length, but nothing complex. As long as the behavior is documented and makes\nsense, then servers using it can easily implement the exact behavior they want.\n\nI propose this behavior:\n\nif res.ContentLength \u003e 0 || res.ContentLength == 0 \u0026\u0026 res.Body != nil {\n    // write Content-Length\n}\n\nThis stays out of the way of server implementors and doesn't try to do anything magical\nor unexpected. No need for the heuristic here, Response.ContentLength is already\nexplicitly specified as unknown (chunked) if -1.\n\n[1]\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/fitstar/falcore/blob/a3c31f03fec11a62d3f49d016b041d1924cd997a/server.go#L297-L331\"\u003ehttps://github.com/fitstar/falcore/blob/a3c31f03fec11a62d3f49d016b041d1924cd997a/server.go#L297-L331\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
