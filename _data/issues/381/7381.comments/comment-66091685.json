I have no problem changing my kern.maxfilesperproc as a\nworkaround.  \n\nBut I wonder, what is the point of kern.maxfilesperproc if it cannot be set to a number\nlower than the hard limit without it being considered misconfigured?  If I set to a\nsetting higher than the hard limit, then I assume the hard limit prevails.  In which\ncase, the only properly configured setting for kern.maxfilesperproc is the hard limit\nwhich makes the setting redundant.\u003c/pre\u003e",
