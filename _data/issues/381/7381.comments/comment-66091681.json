As I understand it, if a user changes their limits\nsetting in launchd this will cause the go build to fail for a minor technical reason.\n\nMy first thought is, \"well, don't do that\" as our CI builders have executed tens of\nthousands of successful builds without having to touch the launchd limits.\n\nIf you could give more background on why you need to change your launchd limits this\nwill help people looking at this issue understand the reasons for it, rather than just\nreacting superficially, as I did initially.\n\nCheers\n\nDave\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-none**, **repo-main**, **os-macosx**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
