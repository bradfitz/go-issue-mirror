	"body": "This isn't a bug per-say, but more of a feature request. Sparse file support is only provided for tar.Reader, but not tar.Writer. Currently, it's a bit asymmetrical, but supporting sparse files on tar.Writer requires API change, which may take some time to think about.\r\n\r\nAlso, this is mostly unrelated to #12594. Although, that bug should definitely be fixed before any attempt at this is made. For the time being, I recommend putting this in the \"unplanned\" milestone, I'll revisit this issue when the other tar bugs are first fixed.",
