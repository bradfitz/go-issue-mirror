	"body": "On Android, the problem seems to be with the newly created thread exiting: it messes up some state that makes future tests fail.\r\n\r\nNote that normally, Go-created threads don't exit until the program terminates.  This should be the case with threads created using newosproc0(), but the test doesn't follow this directive.  While this is fine on other platforms, there's something about Android that makes things go bad if a thread exits.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'll send out a CL that prevents the newly created thread from exiting in the test, and re-enables the test on Android.",
