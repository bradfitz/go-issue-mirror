	"body": "I agree that this is likely darwin-specific. On linux, I believe spurious wakeups are possible, but they are relatively harmless because `write(2)` returns `EAGAIN` instead of `ENOTCONN` in this case and the regular retry loop takes care of it (but it's not completely harmless: I think this is one way in which a connection can end up with a nil `RemoteAddr`). \r\n\r\nSpurious wakeups are also more common on `kqueue` platforms because `netpollclose` is a no-op there: This means that `pollDesc` objects are put back on the freelist before their file descriptors have been closed. But I tried making `netpollclose` unregister the fd with `kqueue` and it did not resolve the problems seen here.\r\n",
