I don't want to see it compiling and running a program for a simple check.\r\n\r\nCan you modify CL 3973 to make it compile those two probe functions into the dist binary itself, and then just make dist exec its own binary (argv[0]) as a child to do the probe and see whether it crashes? It would at least eliminate the extra compile and disk I/O.\r\n",
