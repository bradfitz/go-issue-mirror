I guess that on your system it will print \"true\", but let's verify that.\r\n\r\nNext let's take a look at the modification time of the compiler ($GOROOT/pkg/tool/$GOOS_$GOARCH/compile) and the modification time of the runtime package ($GOROOT/pkg/$GOOS_$GOARCH/runtime.a).  If the compiler appears to have been created after the runtime package, we could see the results you are seeing.\r\n\r\nI guess the next step would be to check the modification times of the runtime source files compared to runtime.a.",
