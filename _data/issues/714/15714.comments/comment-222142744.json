On Ubuntu 16.10, Go profiling is broken only for program linked with the host linker and an explicit buildmode flag overriding the default build mode (or some other kind of explicit flag).\r\n2. On Ubuntu 16.10, Go profiling is broken by default for _every_ program linked with the host linker (so any program using cgo outside the standard library).\r\n\r\nIf its (1), no big deal, it can wait for Go 1.8. If it's (2) and there is an easy fix, that seems more serious. I was reading the original report as if (2) were the case; maybe I misunderstood.\r\n\r\nI will leave the 1.7 decision to @ianlancetaylor since I am about to go away for the summer.",
