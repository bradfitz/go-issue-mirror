For example,\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc hi() string {\r\n        b := make([]byte, 0, 100) // 1st alloc\r\n        b = append(b, \"Hello, \"...)\r\n        b = append(b, \"world.\\n\"...)\r\n        s := string(b)\r\n        b[0] = 'X'\r\n        return s\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nb does not escape here, but it's not safe to use stringtoslicebytetmp because b's backing array is still reachable from the stack.\r\n\r\nThis may be a *liveness* question, not an escape question. If the last point b's backing array is live is at the string conversion, then it should be safe to reuse it.",
