This is usually a mistake\nand probably worth fixing in your code just so that you can get meaningful reports from\nthe race detector about other races.\n\nThe fix would be to have a \"current\" wait group, and have that protected by a mutex, and\nyour Wait method would lock the current wait group, swap in a brand new one, and call\nWait on the old one.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
