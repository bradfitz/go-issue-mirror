	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n1.6\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/go\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/usr/local/go\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -fmessage-length=0 -fdebug-prefix-map=/tmp/go-build436466338=/tmp/go-build -gno-record-gcc-switches\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"0\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nI created a basic reverse proxy:\r\n```Go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n\t\"log\"\r\n\t\"net/http\"\r\n\t\"net/http/httputil\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tlog.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":80\", \u0026httputil.ReverseProxy{\r\n\t\tDirector: func(req *http.Request) {\r\n\t\t\treq.URL.Scheme = \"http\"\r\n\t\t\treq.URL.Host = \"admin-monolith\"\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t}))\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen I sent this HTTP request to the proxy (based on an [example](https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#rfc.section.3.2) in the HTTP/2 spec):\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: server.example.com\r\nConnection: Upgrade, HTTP2-Settings\r\nUpgrade: h2c\r\nHTTP2-Settings: abcdef...\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nAccording to the `Connection` header, `HTTP2-Settings` is a hop-by-hop header, so I expected that the proxy would strip this header before forwarding the request.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nThe `HTTP2-Settings` header (but not the `Upgrade`) header was not stripped but was forwarded to the backend server.\r\n\r\nStripping hop-by-hop headers was implemented in #2735, but only headers explicitly mentioned in RFC 2616 are removed.\r\n\r\nThe relevant quote from [RFC 7230, section 6.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-6.1) is this:\r\n\u003e  A proxy or gateway MUST parse a received Connection header field before\r\n   a message is forwarded and, for each connection-option in this field,\r\n   remove any header field(s) from the message with the same name as the\r\n   connection-option, and then remove the Connection header field itself\r\n   (or replace it with the intermediary's own connection options for the\r\n   forwarded message).\r\n\r\nThe same requirement was included in [RFC 2616, section 14.10](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.10).",
