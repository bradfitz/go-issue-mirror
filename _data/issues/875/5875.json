Fortunately, I can easily work around this from my side, so\nit's not super urgent.\n\nopenssh provides this by sending a \u0026quot;keepalive@openssh.com\u0026quot; (wantreply=1) as\nglobal request once in a while.\n\n\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n1.open SSH connection\n2.wait\n\nsshd says:\n\nJul 12 14:51:10 \u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt; sshd[7143]: Timeout, client not responding.\nJul 12 14:51:10 \u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt; sshd[7111]: pam_unix(ssh:session): session closed for\nuser hanwen\n\nthis is with Go tip, go.crypto tip  \n\na related problem is that, if the remote end is closed, the client does not exit. i'll\nfile a separate issue for that.\u003c/pre\u003e",
