Render's doc comment already says, \"Rendering is done on a 'best effort' basis\".\r\n\r\nThe HTML5 parsing algorithm (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#tree-construction) is an enormous nest of special cases. It prints at 130 pages. I don't think that it guarantees to be idempotent, or even self-consistent (e.g. \"void elements\" are separately listed in a separate document at http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#void-elements), and I can't see an obvious proof that it is either.\r\n\r\nGiven that, the Rendering algorithm is naive, and doesn't promise to render everything you can parse. In any case, the error in the original post is indeed accurate: the void element \u003clink\u003e has child nodes, and it shouldn't.\r\n\r\nYou could argue that Render could return a special RenderingError, separate from I/O errors, that callers are free to ignore. But in general, the space of \"semi-invalid documents\" is ill-defined, and as I said earlier, it's not clear that the parser algorithm guarantees to produce a \"valid document\", so I don't think Render should never return errors (other than I/O errors).\r\n\r\nYou could argue, then that the parser shouldn't have produced a tree that was like that, but the parser is what it is, specified by a 130-page spec that's already too complicated. It would be nice if HTML5 was based on sensible, consistent foundations, but it isn't.",
