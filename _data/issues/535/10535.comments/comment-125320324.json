(Actually I suspect that this tree is valid; does SVG allow children for those elements?)\r\n\r\nBut we don't want to fill the Render function with special-case heuristics that attempt to reconstruct the markup underlying invalid parse trees.\r\n\r\nFor your use case #2, it would be very desirable for Render to never return an error unless the destination Writer returns one. That would make its operation parallel to Parse, which accepts all possible inputs. @nigeltao, what do you think? Should we eliminate errors from Render, and just make it produce the least-wrong output practical?",
