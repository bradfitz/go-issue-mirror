	"body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIt is currently possible to assign a value to a variable named `nil`, as well as other reserved types like `float32`, `int`, and others. Considering how explicit Go seems to be regarding code sanity, I am inclined to consider this a bug.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/AgUlQ810Yi\r\n\r\nI find the one with the overriding of `true` to be the most interesting case (thanks to @Bo0mer for pointing that one out).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMomchil\r\n",
