Just like gcc/java system library.\n\nBut, if user want their 3rd party package, they can use GOPATH to include their local\npackages.\n\nSo, for normal user, it is not necessary to have write permission to system library (I\nmean in my case /opt/go)\n\nThe build script of go-hg is put on \u003ca href=\"https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/go/go-hg/PKGBUILD\"\u003ehttps://aur.archlinux.org/packages/go/go-hg/PKGBUILD\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
