Not sure whether this fix is better than not compiling.\r\n\r\nAfter fixing `context3` both `example/basic` and `example/flappy` compile, but fail at runtime due to a: _\"error creating GL program: glutil: Failed to create D3D shaders.\"_ I've tried using the latest angle dll from Chrome, but it fails similarly.\r\n\r\nNot quite sure whether there's something obvious going wrong wrt shaders. I can make a patch or debug further, but I'm not sure what is the best way to attack the problem.\r\n\r\nRelated https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9306 ",
