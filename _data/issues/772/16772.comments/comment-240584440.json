Unlike in C, it is not valid to advance a pointer just beyond the end of its original allocation\".\r\n\r\nThat section is specifically talking about doing pointer arithmetic with unintptr conversions, but it seems that creating these slice headers is implicitly creating a pointer that is not pointing into any allocated object, and so I'd argue that the section still applies and code is invalid.",
