	"body": "@hyangah was suggesting that we should return a max value for each sensor type to determine what the range of outputs could be.\r\n\r\nAndroid devices are being shipped with various accelerometer chips, and most of them can be dynamically configured to work in different ranges. Similarly, iDevice accelerometer sensors both support +/-2g and +/-8g, but their platform seem to be supporting the 2g range only. (Means their sensor is always working in the 2g mode?)\r\n\r\nSome Android devices are found to report this value inaccurately. A peak-to-peak value is reported whereas zero-to-peak should be reported. https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=63828\r\n\r\n@hyangah, I am not quite sure why you needed the know the range. Could you give me a use case where it's critical?",
