My progress is also slow, too.\n\n\u003ePerhaps we can collaborate on this work?  I can put my existing patches on the web\n\u003esomewhere, or mail them.\nI'm agree with your opinion. Currently my status is the following:\n - Target host is amd64, NetBSD-5.0 (now 5.0.2)\n - Compile golang with \"FreeBSD\" option\n  (I change scripts not to check platform from 'uname', force build as FreeBSD)\n - golang library unit-test is failed because generated binary by 6l does not have\nNetBSD specific ELF section.\nAttached log might be easy to understand my status.\n\nCurrently I do not take care of thread and semaphores and my target is \"hello world.\"\nI will attach the diff after my workspace is updated.\nIf you do not mind, please attach diffs and then let's get on the same page.\n\nThanks,\nTomofumi\n\n----- Log\nkagaribi% pwd\n/home/tom/usr/go/src\nkagaribi% ./all.bash\nrm -f *.o *.6 6.out lib9.a\n(snip)\ngmake[1]: Entering directory `/home/tom/usr/go/src/pkg/archive/tar'\ngotest\ngmake[2]: Entering directory `/home/tom/usr/go/src/pkg/archive/tar'\nrm -f _test/archive/tar.a _gotest_.6\ngmake[2]: Leaving directory `/home/tom/usr/go/src/pkg/archive/tar'\ngmake[2]: Entering directory `/home/tom/usr/go/src/pkg/archive/tar'\n6g -o _gotest_.6 common.go reader.go writer.go    reader_test.go writer_test.go\nrm -f _test/archive/tar.a\ngopack grc _test/archive/tar.a _gotest_.6\ngmake[2]: Leaving directory `/home/tom/usr/go/src/pkg/archive/tar'\n/home/tom/usr/bin/gotest: line 164: ./6.out: cannot execute binary file\ngmake[1]: *** [test] Error 126\ngmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/tom/usr/go/src/pkg/archive/tar'\ngmake: *** [archive/tar.test] Error 2\u003c/pre\u003e",
