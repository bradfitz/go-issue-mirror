I am suggesting discourage inflection and use the long form, as cancellation doesn't seem to have an accepted inflected variant. And I am not talking about google searches of web pages, blogs, and such- I am strictly speaking about academia. As in my previous posts, I suggest using the long form so that all the suffixed variants of cancel are consistent. - cancel, cancelling, cancelled, cancellation.\r\n\r\nThere are arguments for each side. I stated my opinion- not much else to argue. It boils down to the nitty gritty of taste. robpike will do what robpike does, its your task commander assignee.\r\n\r\nInteresting data sets can be produced using Ngrams: https://books.google.com/ngrams\r\nMaybe experiment before making your decision.",
