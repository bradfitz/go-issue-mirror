My summary is at\n\u003ca href=\"http://9fans.net/archive/2010/03/250\"\u003ehttp://9fans.net/archive/2010/03/250\u003c/a\u003e. For real RSA keys, I believe one round suffices.\n\nA followup message suggested that it might be worth varying the number of rounds based\non the length of the prime. \u003ca href=\"http://9fans.net/archive/2010/03/252\"\u003ehttp://9fans.net/archive/2010/03/252\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, **go1.3maybe**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
