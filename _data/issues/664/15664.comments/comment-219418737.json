When I then submit a file, which invokes FormFile, I get a filepath from Filename that does not contain slashes (e.g. C:UserssdrDesktoptest.csv). I am using 1.6.2 on windows.\r\n\r\nI use the call to exec.Command(...).Start() as a convenience so that the initial page opens automatically. Removing it does not change the problem.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I've been using Go for a couple of years now and I think it's awesome. Thank you very much for the time and effort you put into it.\r\n\r\nScott",
