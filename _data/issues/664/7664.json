	"body": "by **Matthew.Ickstadt**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI noticed a TODO in time.go which was still present in 1afdecdd77c1:\n\ntype Time struct {\n        // sec gives the number of seconds elapsed since\n        // January 1, year 1 00:00:00 UTC.\n        sec int64\n\n        // nsec specifies a non-negative nanosecond\n        // offset within the second named by Seconds.\n        // It must be in the range [0, 999999999].\n        //\n        // It is declared as uintptr instead of int32 or uint32\n        // to avoid garbage collector aliasing in the case where\n        // on a 64-bit system the int32 or uint32 field is written\n        // over the low half of a pointer, creating another pointer.\n==\u0026gt;     // TODO(rsc): When the garbage collector is completely\n==\u0026gt;     // precise, change back to int32.\n==\u0026gt;     nsec uintptr\n\n        // loc specifies the Location that should be used to\n        // determine the minute, hour, month, day, and year\n        // that correspond to this Time.\n        // Only the zero Time has a nil Location.\n        // In that case it is interpreted to mean UTC.\n        loc *Location\n}\n\nNow that the GC completely precise, I'm assuming this minor change can be made.\u003c/pre\u003e",
