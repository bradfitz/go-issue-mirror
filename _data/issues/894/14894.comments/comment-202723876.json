I can reproduce the issue on 9front's amd64 kernel (which the builder is running), but not on 9k, though the interfaces are similar.\r\n\r\nI get the same issue when the linker has been cross-compiled from Linux. The issue goes away when I add print statements in src/cmd/link/internal/ld/objfile.go or when I run `go build -v`.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. I can provide a QEMU image running 9front/amd64 if needed.\r\n",
