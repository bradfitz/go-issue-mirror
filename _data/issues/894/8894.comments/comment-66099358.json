But I don't have time for it right\nnow.\nBut I can say that the freelist operation is the slowest part of mallocgc.\nRegarding caching, yes, caller wants the block in cache. But there is significant\ndifference between async store that goes into write buffer causing prefetch into cache\nand a load of uncached data with a subsequent control dependency on the value.
