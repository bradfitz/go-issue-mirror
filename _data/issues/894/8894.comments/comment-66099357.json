That will eliminate #5 and get us #1\nalso.\n\nI'm not sure #2 is actually an advantage.  We want to touch the objects we're\nallocating, the caller is going to want them in the cache.  #3 could actually be\nhelpful, though.\n\nI'm not convinced linked list operations are really that slow.  Popping something off\nthe head of the list is just two loads and a store.\u003c/pre\u003e",
