	"body": "My understanding from talking to someone working on gowin32: There's an analog macro in the Win32 API, `MAKEINTRESOURCE`, which casts the integer to a `LPCTSTR`, which is a pointer to a null terminated string. It's used to simulate function overloading in C. It's apparently not treated like a valid pointer in Windows C/C++ land and thus not subject to garbage collection, which is why they're able to get away with it. The gowin32 library is basically trying to emulate similar functionality.\r\n\r\ngowin32 will have to break how its `MAKEINTRESOURCE` function works, which I suppose is just the reality we're in now.",
