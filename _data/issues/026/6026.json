Attempt to use \u0026quot;go get\u0026quot; to access the repo, specifying the repo using an\nabsolute path\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nI would expect it to be possible\n\n===\n\nI would like to be able to fetch private repositories with \u0026quot;go get\u0026quot;, via ssh. \nHowever, HG over ssh uses a double slash to specify an absolute path, and \u0026quot;go\nget\u0026quot; cleans the URL of double slashes, converting them to single slashes. \n\nExample\n\nA mercurial command to clone the repo would be: \n$ hg clone ssh://myhg.com//abs/path/to/repo\u0026quot;\n\nAttempting it with \u0026quot;go get\u0026quot;:\n$ go get -x -v myhg.com//abs/path/to/repo.hg\n\nResults in:\n...\n# cd .; hg identify ssh://myhg.com/abs/path/to/repo\nremote: abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!\nabort: no suitable response from remote hg!\nmyhg.com/abs/path/to/repo.hg (download)\n\nHG uses a double slash to denote an absolute path.  With a single slash, the path is\ntaken relative to the user's home directory (which is not appropriate for shared repos). \n\n===\n\nKyle Lemons had some notes:\n- to handle this case, only // between the host and path would need to be maintained\n- we might also only allow the // when we try ssh://, since that seems like the only one\nthat wants it\u003c/pre\u003e",
