The solution is to use SIX instead of S\nwhen your intents are to possibly promote to X. SIX is not compatible with other SIX,\nbut is compatible with S. So on SIX-\u003eX promotion, the owner of SIX waits only for\nother's S to release and then he is known to be alone to go -\u003eX (hence no deadlock\npossible here).\n\nIt may or may not make anything faster. It may make some code paths much simpler: If you\nfind under R, that you need W, you have to release R and acquire W. Meanwhile state may\nhave changed. On the path SIX-\u003eX that cannot happen. Sometimes a big win.\u003c/pre\u003e",
