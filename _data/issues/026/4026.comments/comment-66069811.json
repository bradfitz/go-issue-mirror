I\nwill defer to Dmitry on that.\n\nAs Remy points out, a method to upgrade from an rlock to a wlock atomically is not\npossible. Having a wlock means no one else has an rlock, so it is impossible to satisfy\nthis sequence:\n   - goroutine 1 rlocks\n   - goroutine 2 rlocks\n   - goroutine 1 calls upgrade\n   - goroutine 2 calls upgrade\n\nGoroutine 1 cannot be upgraded to a wlock until goroutine 2 releases the rlock, and vice\nversa. Deadlock.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._",
