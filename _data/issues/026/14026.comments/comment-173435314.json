Nonetheless, the Screen.NewBuffer method has to return a type - an abstract, driver-indepentent type - and in Go, abstract types are interface types.\r\n\r\nThe foodriver Window is not expected to handle any Buffer implementations other than the foodriver Buffer implementation.\r\n\r\nYou will need to rethink your strategy. Your Editor should not be a Buffer. It should be able to render itself onto a Buffer (one provided by Screen.NewBuffer).",
