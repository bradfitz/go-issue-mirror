Even in specific cases, it can be difficult in practice: for example, lifetime requirements can be maintained even when sending a []byte down a channel as long as the slice is no longer used by the time the return from, i.e., Write, occurs.\r\n\r\nBecause of the practical need for such a tool to strike some balance between accuracy and usefulness, it'd likely have to be a 3rd party tool with some kind of annotations or hinting (preferably outside of the Go code, perhaps similar to the API checking tool).",
