From Matthias' description, he seems to think that embedding an interface is\nlike embedding a struct.  An interface just declares a set of member methods.  Thus,\nembedding it doesn't pull in any methods at all, since there's no implementations in an\ninterface.  So the error at run-time is correct.\n\nOf course, the compiler should've been able to detect that MyObject does not satisfy the\nFer interface.  It has a Fer member, but that's not the same thing.  Therefore, the\nassignment to 'c' should not be allowed.\n\nDid I misunderstand the issues anywhere?\n\n--jc\u003c/pre\u003e",
