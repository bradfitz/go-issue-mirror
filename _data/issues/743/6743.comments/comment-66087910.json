After further reading, yes it looks like you are correct\nthat this does what is indicated in the documentation:\n\n\"DotWriter returns a writer that can be used to write a dot-encoding to w. It takes care\nof inserting leading dots when necessary, translating line-ending \\n into \\r\\n, and\nadding the final .\\r\\n line when the DotWriter is closed. The caller should close the\nDotWriter before the next call to a method on w.\"\n-- \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/net/textproto/#Writer.DotWriter\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/pkg/net/textproto/#Writer.DotWriter\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe specified behavior is not what I expected, but my expectations seem to be off-target.\u003c/pre\u003e",
