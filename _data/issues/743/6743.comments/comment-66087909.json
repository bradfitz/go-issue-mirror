All bare newlines are converted to \\r\\n and a '.\\r\\n'\nis added at the end of the buffer when the writer is closed as per spec (see\n\u003ca href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-4.5.2)\"\u003ehttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-4.5.2)\u003c/a\u003e.  The reason this might appear\ninconsistent is that you're immediately calling Close(), which triggers the DotWriter to\nwrap things up to ensure that the buffer ends with '\\r\\n.\\r\\n'\n\nThe reason \\r\\n is added to the end of \"foo\" is that, when Close() is called, the writer\nis in the 'wstateData' state, meaning \\r\\n is necessary before the .\\r\\n closing line.\n\nThe reason \\r\\n is added at the end of \"foo\\n\" is that newlines are prefixed with '\\r'\nwhen in the 'wstateData' state, which then sets the state to 'wstateBeginLine'.  When in\nthis state, Close() simply writes out the .\\r\\n closing line and flushes.  Either way,\nthis is exactly how you'd expect it to work.\u003c/pre\u003e",
