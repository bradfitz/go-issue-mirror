(Note that if you run read_file while the file is still being downloaded, it\nwill /not/ wait to finish until the whole file is downloaded. Ordinary files can't be\nused as FIFOs.)\n\nPerhaps the size limitations on slices should be documented in the spec? (Or better,\nremoved? It does feel somewhat artificial.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
