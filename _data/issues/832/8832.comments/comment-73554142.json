You have 100,000 goroutines, could you indicate\r\nwhich of the following are true, say for 99,000 of the goroutines.\r\n1) Each go routine gets input from\r\na. A channel\r\nb. A socket\r\nc. shared immutable memory\r\nd. shared mutable memory\r\ne. no input, only output.\r\n2) Each go routine provides output to\r\na. A channel\r\nb. A socket\r\nc. shared memory that it mutates\r\n    1. with pointers to freshly allocated data structures\r\n    2. no freshly allocated memory is referenced after the goroutine ends\r\n\r\nI ask this since the answers will help dictate the best solution. An optimal solution for a goroutine\r\nthat just does a 10 second noop might be to just elide the goroutine, which is probably not what you want.\r\n\r\n ",
