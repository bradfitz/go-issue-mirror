	"body": "I have successfully reproduced this outside of Go.  I hacked the runtime to log every time it does an mmap, munmap, or madvise.  A little C program replays the log and exhibits the same behavior.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem may be the number of madvise calls.  There are over 4000 of them in this example.  The resulting heap has lots of 1 page in-use spans interspersed with small (1-10 pages typically) not-in-use spans.  I'm not sure why our in-use pages are so scattered.  I'll look into that, it is not the root cause of this bug but may be contributing.\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can send the extracted example to linux folks.",
