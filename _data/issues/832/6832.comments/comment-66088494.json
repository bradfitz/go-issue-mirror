We use a struct defined\npretty much like Dave's a.MyError above which works just fine in Go 1.1.2 but began\nfailing as Dave shows above with Go 1.2.\n\nWas there a change that made such assignments illegal?  By the lexical rules for\nexported/unexported the 1.2 behavior seems right but I've always seen error (and string,\nmap, append, copy, len, cap, new, make, etc.) as special and above that rule.\u003c/pre\u003e",
