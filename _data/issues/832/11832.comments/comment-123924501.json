	"body": "The spec is already clear on this, in its terse way.  In http://golang.org/ref/spec#Handling_panics it says \"Suppose a function G defers a function D that calls recover and a panic occurs in a function on the same goroutine in which G is executing.\"  It goes on to explain when recover will work.  There is nothing in the spec that says that recover will work on panic in a function that is not running in the same goroutine.\r\n\r\nSomebody could write a blog entry or something, perhaps.  Actually, there is already a blog entry: http://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover.  It says \"If the current goroutine is panicking, a call to recover will capture the value given to panic and resume normal execution.\"\r\n\r\nSo really I'm not sure what there is to do.",
