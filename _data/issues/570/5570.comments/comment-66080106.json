You could\nprobably refer to the type identity section, but extending it to methods or members of\nmethod sets might be confusing. Methods don't exist as types in the language, and\nmethods and members of method sets have different identity rules.\n\nExample:\n\nmethod identity:\nfunc (f Foo) Bar(fb FooBar) == func (b Foo) Bar(bf FooBar)\nfunc (f Foo) Bar(fb FooBar) != func (b FooBar) Bar(bf Foo)\n\nmember of method set identity:\nfunc (f Foo) Bar(fb FooBar) == func (b FooBar) Bar(bf FooBar)\u003c/pre\u003e",
