My doubt was resolved.\r\n\r\n\u003e If you don't have another machine I could build you a patched Go release and put it somewhere for you to download.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nI don't have another machine but I can downgrade to Beta3, and can build `go` binary on this kernel version.\r\nI will try to you proposed way.\r\n\r\nAs a result, If the workaround is successful, does it mean that We must use the patched bootstrap go toolchain on the macOS?\r\nlike this issue became a reality? https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16352#issuecomment-232446013\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nSorry, it's off topic. Can I ask a question?\r\n\r\nI didn't understand the reason that why to use the 1.4 version to bootstrap toolchain than 1.6 stable or etc.\r\nI'm gopher newbie, so I don't know 1.4 eras.\r\nbut I know that is the last version of using C, and still the fastest.\r\n\r\nSo simply, shorten the time to build the latest Golang? or Will it also affect the latest(devel) go binary of the performance if we use it?",
