(Note the first position listed in the stack trace, /usr/local/go/src/runtime/mheap.c:692.)\r\n\r\nIf you are applying @bradfitz's patch to your GOROOT, it won't fix the error you are seeing because the 1.4 binary is already built and not being rebuilt.\r\n\r\nDo you have another machine not running Beta4? If so, could you please:\r\n\r\n1. Apply the patch on the other machine.\r\n2. Build a Go installation.\r\n3. Copy the Go installation to the machine with Beta4.\r\n4. Use the new copy of Go as GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have another machine I could build you a patched Go release and put it somewhere for you to download.",
