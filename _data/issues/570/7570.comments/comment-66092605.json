It seems to me that that is correct\nbehaviour: if . is on PATH, and the job is executed in a directory that contains a file\nwith the name of the executable, then I would expect it to run the file in that\ndirectory.  And that seems to be what happens.\n\nIn your first example, the job is executed in a different directory, but I would not\nexpect that directory to be used to find the executable.  And that is also what happens.\n\nSo, yes, the behaviour differs, but it still seems right to me.\u003c/pre\u003e",
