It is in doc.go but only in the \"implementation\ndetails\" section, which is not part of the command documentation.  The _swig_goallocate\nwrapper needs to be removed in favor of something else, but I don't believe the Go 1\ncompatibility rules cover swig. Even if they did, I would put this in the \"specification\nerror\" exception.\u003c/pre\u003e",
