	"body": "My current thinking on this is that these values should be folded into the ```app``` package. Stored in a type like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Config struct {\r\n        Width       geom.Pt\r\n        Height      geom.Pt\r\n        PixelsPerPt float32\r\n        Orientation Orientation\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith a package function, ```func State() Config``` and a field of the ```Callbacks``` struct: ```State: func(Config)```.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not going to think about this again until after the Go 1.5 freeze. Then I'll prototype it in some apps and if it works, send out a CL. I believe there's some other Issue opened somewhere about app configuration updates, this would cover that too.",
