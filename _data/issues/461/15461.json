	"body": "There's been a long-standing TODO in net/http.Transport that says:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Transport struct {\r\n....\r\n    // TODO: tunable on global max cached connections\r\n....\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis bug is about that.\r\n\r\nWe already have `Transport.MaxIdleConnsPerHost`, but it's been requested by many (and again recently) that we have a `Transport.MaxIdleConns` for any host.\r\n\r\nIn the process, I also noticed that we're not aggressively removing cached connections when the peer server disconnects. We only lazily clean them up from the idle structures, which means we can hold onto memory for the bufio.Readers/Writers for a long time, wasting memory.\r\n\r\n/cc @adg \r\n",
