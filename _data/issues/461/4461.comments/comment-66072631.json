It should do something like 10 or 100 iterations and divide by the\ncount to throw away the noise. \n\nChanging the bug to be about adding a function for counting mallocs to package testing.\nThe TestCountMallocs in package fmt is a good template.\n\nThen we should use the function in this test and others.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to **---**._",
