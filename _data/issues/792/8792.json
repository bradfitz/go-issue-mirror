	"body": "\u003cpre\u003ecmd/vet's docs (\u003ca href=\"http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/vet)\"\u003ehttp://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/vet)\u003c/a\u003e state the following:\n\n\u0026gt; Vet's exit code is 2 for erroneous invocation of the tool, 1 if a problem was\nreported, and 0 otherwise.\n\nHowever, sometimes its exit code is 0 even when there are problems found. Specifically,\nthe exit code is always 0 whenever valid input that is a directory is given, regardless\nif problems were reported or otherwise.\n\nThanks to Krzysztof (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/kjk)\"\u003ehttps://github.com/kjk)\u003c/a\u003e for originally discovering this issue.\n\nThe fix is relatively trivial so I will be submitting a CL that fixes this shortly.\n\n\nWhat does 'go version' print?\n\ngo version go1.3.1 darwin/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n1. run `go tool vet ./some-directory-with-problems/`\n2. run `echo $?`\n\nWhat happened?\n\nexit code: 0\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nexit code: 1\u003c/pre\u003e",
