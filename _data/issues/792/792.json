I turned it on for one of my apps, and left it running for \na few hours. The svg profile is attached. \n\nThe only weird thing seems to be the big chunk dedicated to 'malg', which is \napparently related to allocating goroutines when the program starts. My app has \naround ~90 goroutines running concurrently. Other than that, things seem pretty \nreasonable. \n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux/amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?
