I could\nbe wrong, but, I think, semantically windows and unix (*netFD).Close are different. One\nwaits for all outstanding IO to finish, while the other does not. The questions here is:\n\"What is guaranteed on (*netFD).Close return? Can it be assumed that all outstanding IO\nis completed and is flushed to OS or canceled? Can we be certain that OS socket is\nclosed?\". Perhaps it is not important, but I would like to run this concern by you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
