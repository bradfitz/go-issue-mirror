	"body": "by **nicolas.riesch**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI installed go 1.3, and ran \u0026quot;go build\u0026quot; on my program with no problem at all.\nBut when I ran \u0026quot;go test\u0026quot;, it took one hour to compile.\n\nI have already noticed that in go 1.2.2, \u0026quot;go build\u0026quot; was really fast, but that\n\u0026quot;go test\u0026quot; was strangely slow, taking 2 minutes to compile my program (most of\nthis time being used by the linker 6l).\n\nHowever, the problem is not in the \u0026quot;testing\u0026quot; package or \u0026quot;go test\u0026quot;\ntool.\nIn fact, the problem is that my test files contain very long arrays, which is usual for\ntable driven tests.\n\nHere is a small program with around 500 test records in a \u0026quot;samples\u0026quot; array.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/qpxcVGkzuk\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/qpxcVGkzuk\u003c/a\u003e\n\nBelow are the times to build this program.\nYou see that if the \u0026quot;samples\u0026quot; array is local to the test function, the build\ntime is many times worse than when the array is global.\nAnd that with go 1.3, the build time is really long.\n\n$ time go build\n\ngo version go1.2.2 linux/amd64\n==============================\nBuild time when \u0026quot;samples\u0026quot; array is inside the main function:\nreal    0m2.437s\nuser    0m2.232s\nsys    0m0.156s\n\nBuild time when \u0026quot;samples\u0026quot; array is outside the main function (samples array is\na global variable):\nreal    0m0.960s\nuser    0m0.820s\nsys    0m0.108s\n\ngo version go1.3 linux/amd64\n============================\nBuild time when \u0026quot;samples\u0026quot; array is inside the main function:\nreal    0m55.898s\nuser    0m55.228s\nsys    0m0.228s\n\nBuild time when \u0026quot;samples\u0026quot; array is outside the main function (samples array is\na global variable):\nreal    0m3.833s\nuser    0m3.676s\nsys    0m0.104s\n\nThe build time has become 55.9 seconds / 2.4 seconds = 23 times worse in go 1.3\n\nIn my real program test files, I have a total of 8000 samples in the \u0026quot;samples\u0026quot;\narray, and it takes 1 hour to compile.\nThe degradation in the build time is faster than linear.\u003c/pre\u003e",
