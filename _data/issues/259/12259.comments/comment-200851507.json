Removing first return enables back `dsymutil` call, but not `machoCombineDwarf`. I just did reproduce the problem, then I forcefully killed `go build` with Ctrl+\\ when it was stuck in the linker, so I got the temporary files there.\r\n\r\nNext I ran `dsymutil` manually and it seems to be performance hog there. At least in this specific case. Still it for `v8` case where `libv8_base.a` is ~500MB the produced `go.dwarf` file is ~100MB, which is a lot so I can imagine `dsymutil` does a lot of work rewriting all this debug information.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n$ time /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/dsymutil -f /var/folders/pr/80gqg1k12d5fwjfvtxjdh1t40000gn/T/go-build517742936/_/Users/ono/Code/Applications/Go/bugs/macho/_obj/exe/a.out -o /var/folders/pr/80gqg1k12d5fwjfvtxjdh1t40000gn/T/go-link-980826351/go.dwarf\r\nwarning: (x86_64) /var/folders/pr/80gqg1k12d5fwjfvtxjdh1t40000gn/T/go-build546433112/runtime/cgo/_obj/gcc_darwin_amd64.o unable to open object file: No such file or directory\r\nwarning: (x86_64) /var/folders/pr/80gqg1k12d5fwjfvtxjdh1t40000gn/T/go-build546433112/runtime/cgo/_obj/gcc_libinit.o unable to open object file: No such file or directory\r\nwarning: (x86_64) /var/folders/pr/80gqg1k12d5fwjfvtxjdh1t40000gn/T/go-build546433112/runtime/cgo/_obj/gcc_setenv.o unable to open object file: No such file or directory\r\nwarning: (x86_64) /var/folders/pr/80gqg1k12d5fwjfvtxjdh1t40000gn/T/go-build546433112/runtime/cgo/_obj/gcc_util.o unable to open object file: No such file or directory\r\nwarning: (x86_64) /var/folders/pr/80gqg1k12d5fwjfvtxjdh1t40000gn/T/go-build546433112/runtime/cgo/_obj/gcc_amd64.o unable to open object file: No such file or directory\r\nwhile processing /var/folders/pr/80gqg1k12d5fwjfvtxjdh1t40000gn/T/go-link-980826351/go.o:\r\nwarning: could not find referenced DIE\r\n...above msg repeating ~20x times\r\n\r\nreal\t0m15.578s\r\nuser\t0m13.806s\r\nsys\t0m1.609s\r\n~~~\r\n",
