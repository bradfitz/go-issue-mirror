	"body": "@sethwklein Thanks. I looked at the tgz you provided when you posted it 6 days ago, and the profile suggests that we're just spending a lot of time in Write. The writes are not buffered, so you'd think maybe there are lots of small writes happening, but I don't see that either. It looks like it copies one whole DWARF section at a time. So I thought maybe there are many (like 100s) of DWARF sections. But there are not. So I can't tell why it should be so bad.\r\n\r\nI may poke at this again over the next couple weeks, but it may have to wait until Go 1.7. I know that's not great.",
