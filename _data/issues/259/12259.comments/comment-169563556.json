But here's a run with the test case from the OP which also exhibits 16s builds normally and sub 2s with `-ldflags=-s` for me. The binary makes it bigger than GitHub will host so I've hosted it: [link-pprof-sethwklein-testcase-2016-01-07.tar.gz](http://sethwklein.net/link-pprof-sethwklein-testcase-2016-01-07.tar.gz).\r\n\r\nWhen wondering what could differ between my setup and yours, @rsc, I realize that I installed `v8worker` on 16 June 2015, and haven't touched it since, although the `.a` file under `pkg` is being touched in some fashion every time.\r\n\r\nI also have a list in `GOPATH`, although I find it hard to believe that could make a difference. `v8worker` is installed under the first item of two in my `GOPATH`.\r\n",
