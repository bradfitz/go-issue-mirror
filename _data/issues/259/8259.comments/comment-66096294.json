I\nam not sure what's going on. Maybe it's not really fixed, but that 20 minutes is much\nlonger than the reported 55 seconds. \n\nIt would be nice to have a test case demonstrating the 55 seconds.\n\nI feel fairly confident the fix is correct, but it's still a bit larger than I would\nlike for a point release, and unless I can prove it actually fixes the original case I\nam inclined not to include it.\n\nNot sure about 1.3.1 at this point.\u003c/pre\u003e",
