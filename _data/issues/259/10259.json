	"body": "When asking pprof for output using `web`, it [currently](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/c9d0c812142be1c8f224012f24d111ba46ccdc10/src/cmd/pprof/internal/commands/commands.go#L84) selects browsers using an in-order traversal of the list '\"chrome\", \"google-chrome\", \"firefox\"'. On each platform, it also tries a platform-specific file opener (`xdg-open` on *nix) if all the list of browsers all fail to execute.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is non-intuitive, as users' browser preferences are not respect if they have one of those browsers installed, but use another browser by default (this is particularly common for web developers). Instead, only the platform-specific opener should be used, and only in the case where it fails should fallbacks be attempted.",
