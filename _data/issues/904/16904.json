	"body": "github.com/golang/freetype already exists, but its license (the Freetype license) differs from the Go standard library, and code in the stdlib or under golang.org/x cannot depend on out-of-tree code.\r\n\r\nI propose to add two new packages in the golang.org/x/image repo that together lets you use TTFs to draw text. There are existing packages under golang.org/x/image/font that can draw bitmap fonts, but this would be the first golang.org/x package that draws vector fonts.\r\n\r\nThe golang.org/x/image/vector package rasterizes 2-D vector graphics: filled and stroked polygons and BÃ©zier curves. 2-D vector graphics (and the scope of this package) encompasses more than just fonts, but this package will rasterize the glyphs of a vector font such as TrueType. It'd be comparable to the github.com/golang/freetype/raster package, but not based on the Freetype code.\r\n\r\nThe golang.org/x/image/font/sfnt package parses sfnt font formats, including TrueType (.ttf) and OpenType (.otf). It will implement the existing golang.org/x/image/font font.Face interface for font format agnostic text drawing. It'd be comparable to the github.com/golang/freetype/truetype package, but not based on the Freetype code.\r\n\r\nA proof of concept (as a single \"package main\" instead of two separate packages) exists in a separate repository, https://github.com/google/font-go, which is in turn based on https://github.com/google/font-rs and the accompanying article (https://medium.com/@raphlinus/inside-the-fastest-font-renderer-in-the-world-75ae5270c445) by Raph Levien of Google. Roughly speaking, font.go would become package sfnt, and raster.go and acc*.{go,s} would become package vector.",
