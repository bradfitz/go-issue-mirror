If we\nrefuse to add it, they'll have to switch to other client software. It doesnt do much for\nanybody's security.\n\nI am reworking transport.go in gosshnew to add support for AES-GCM (and we have base\nlibrary support, chacha20-poly1305), so I will reworking the design shortly anyway. \nThat should make it relatively easy to add 3des-cbc.\u003c/pre\u003e",
