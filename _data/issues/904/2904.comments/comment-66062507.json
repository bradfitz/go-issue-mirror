I don't think anyone is\nasking for these ciphers to be enabled by default. While it does pose a security risk,\nsometimes people have to deal with SSH implementations that don't support CTR ciphers.\nIn this case, bad cryptography is better than plain text as long as the library user\nknows what's happening.\u003c/pre\u003e",
