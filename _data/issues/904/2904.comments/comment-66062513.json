There is an argument that\nthey should just throw them away, but not everybody can make this choice. AFAICT, the\nfirst CTR ciphers appeared in openssh 3.7, if compiled against (OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER\n\u003e= 0x00905000L).\n\nHow about 1.) I do the refactoring for AES-GCM in gosshnew, making it easy to add CBC\n2.) somebody prepares a patch for 3DES-CBC and attaches it here. We don't integrate the\npatch, but somebody that really needs it can patch his library locally.\u003c/pre\u003e",
