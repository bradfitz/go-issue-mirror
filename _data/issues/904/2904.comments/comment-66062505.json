A wrapper abstracting block/stream ciphers\ninto a single interface might be in order. This might also be a good time to get rid of\nthe fixed packetSizeMultiple (transport.go).\n\nContact me if you have time to lend me some SSH/go.crypto.ssh expertise and I'll see\nwhat I can come up with for a patch.\u003c/pre\u003e",
