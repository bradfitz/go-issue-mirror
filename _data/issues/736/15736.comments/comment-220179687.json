Maybe we shouldn't do both if one of them would be enough.\n\u003e\n\u003e Good point. But parallelizing compilation within a package requires\n\u003e removing a bunch of remaining global variables in the compiler, which might\n\u003e take longer than Josh's proposal?\n\u003e\nI don't know.  Global variables are kinda hard, but not insurmountable.\nParallelizing compiles sounds like the code is easier, but it may make the\nsystem harder to manage - how many parallel compiles should be running?\nHow much memory would that take?  What if there's an error?  The\nmultiprocess spiderweb gets unwieldy after a while.\n\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you commented.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/15736#issuecomment-220177954\u003e\n\u003e\n",
