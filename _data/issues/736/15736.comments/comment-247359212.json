	"body": "This CL just made it to the top of my queue for cleanup and mailing, but not quite fast enough. I'm out on vacation until late October. This might or might not happen for Go 1.8. If not 1.8, though, 1.9; I do intend to see it through.\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to pick up the ball and run with it while I'm away, the WIP code is at this [unstable link](https://github.com/josharian/go/commit/ff0ced1bf5d0cf18f42a09f7732a02576c9d3a9e). The major TODOs are:\r\n\r\n* Split this CL into several. At a minimum, one doing a tracing refactor and one adding trace support to cmd/go.\r\n* Add tracing to non-build steps.\r\n",
