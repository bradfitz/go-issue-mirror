	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eMemStats contains PauseNs, which gives recent history of GC pauses, but it does not tell\nwhen they happened.\nI'd like to see a parallel array that gives the end time of each pause (start time makes\nmore sense but LastGC is an end time, so be consistent).\nThis information should be exported in runtime/debug's GCStats too.\nHaving this information available would let Go servers check observed latencies against\nGC pause history, to see if a specific latency included a GC pause or not.\u003c/pre\u003e",
