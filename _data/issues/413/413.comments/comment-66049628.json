This allowed \ntime for some of the \"leaving\" statements to be printed.\n\nThis indicated a race condition between main() returning, and defer statements being\nexecuted after go \nroutines have completed their normal operations, including channel communication.\n\nWhat I have come up with a programming style which passed \"done\" channels into deferred\nstatements and \nsynchronizes them. See the attached program which produces the expected output:\n\nI guess this is now either a documentation/tutorial/course bug or language change\nrequest...\n\nKen\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/413/2/Un_Trace_defer.go\"\u003eUn_Trace_defer.go\u003c/a\u003e (2712 bytes)",
