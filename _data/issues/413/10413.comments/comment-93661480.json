It only took my computer a minute or so.\r\n\r\nThere's still a bug here, that we don't seem to notice that we're not making progress during the Huffman decode, but I don't think it's a hang. More investigation coming...\r\n\r\nAs for whether we should not try to decode 'unreasonably large images', that's issue #5050 to discuss what 'unreasonable' means and how it's expressed in API.",
