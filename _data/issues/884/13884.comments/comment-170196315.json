The understand the sentiment of this and the precedent of the\nmap change but on balance I would prefer not to see this change land.\n\nTo give some background, juju is close to 200k lines and many of our tests\nwere faulty and needed to be fixed as I'm trying to drag canonical off Go\n1.2. This is a good thing.\n\nHowever I've also spent an equal amount of time internally defending the\nmap change from people who persist that Go changed something by randomising\nmap ordering, when of course there was never a promise of ordering in the\nfirst place. My coworkers are unable to see this as their own carelessness,\nand blame Go for deliberately breaking their code to this day.\n\nThis sort change may help people project themselves from themselves, but\nthey aren't going to thank us, no matter how well intentioned our\nmotivations.\n\nThanks\n\nDave\n\nOn Sat, 9 Jan 2016, 15:35 Rob Pike \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\n\u003e It's not the performance hit that bothers me, it's the message: We will\n\u003e deliberately surprise you with our algorithms because of something that\n\u003e doesn't really matter to you.\n\u003e\n\u003e I'm not totally opposed, I just find it distasteful.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/13884#issuecomment-170194663\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
