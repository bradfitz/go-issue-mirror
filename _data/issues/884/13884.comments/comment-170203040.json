My position is that it was not that this\nsort change or the map change were the results of an accidental side effect\nof an optimisation, but that it was a willful, however well intentioned,\nchange that my colleagues are unable to accept.They cannot get past the\nfact that this was a deliberate chnage aimed at flushing out their code.\n\nI honestly believe if a change to the sort algorithm caused the effect that\nis being deliberately proposed today, people would be more accepting of\nthis change as a bug in their code than they were about the map change. I\ndon't agree with the argument that we'll probably break this invariant\n(which wasn't an invariant to being with) later, so its best to do it in a\ncontrolled manner. Developers have a controlled manner, they can stay on\nthe previous version of Go until they have fixed their buggy code.\n\nRe making this optional, nobody used the vendor experiment til it was\nenabled by default, and few people test the beta versions of go we push out\nno matter how hard we pleed, if you're going to make this change, please\ndon't sit on the fence by making it opt in.\n\nThanks\n\nDave\n\nOn Sat, 9 Jan 2016, 17:58 Robert Griesemer \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\n\u003e @davecheney \u003chttps://github.com/davecheney\u003e I understand the sentiment in\n\u003e this case.
