This is a condition that will be\ntriggered if the test condition for the loop returns false. Typically its impossible to\ndetermine the difference between a test case failure, and a break. The destination jump\npoint for a test fase failure is typically set to the same as break, however allowing\nthese to be defined differently provides much more power with minimal complexity.\n\nA simple use case to describe what I am asking for would be to detect the presence of a\nnumber in a list, break when found, and if not found return an error. It seems that the\ncode for this is somewhat more complex that it would be with the feature I am proposing.\nHere are two methods that currently work, and a commented out proposal:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/3xVFaNQcW8\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/3xVFaNQcW8\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIs this reasonable and worth doing?\u003c/pre\u003e",
