This means you can run\n\nGOARCH=amd64 ./all.bash\nGOARCH=386 ./all.bash\n\nand then at the end you have the tools\nand libraries for both architectures installed.\n\nA workaround is to set GOBIN and then\nremove it yourself to get rid of everything.\nYou'll always want to remove the subdirectories\nof $GOROOT/pkg.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
