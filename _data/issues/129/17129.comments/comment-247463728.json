It just says that there will be a final discussion about the proposal and a decision, possibly made by an arbiter.\r\n\r\nIn issues where there is overwhelming disagreement, the proposal is declined.\r\nIn issues where there is overwhelming agreement, the proposal tends to be accepted.\r\nIn highly contentious issues (such as the alias proposal), where agreement and disagreement go hand in hand, the arbiter becomes essential. It makes sense that this arbiter is (a member of) the Go team.",
