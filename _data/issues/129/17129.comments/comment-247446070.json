You saying \"50-50\" implies there's some counting of votes happening.\r\n\r\nWith a community as large as Go and Github, there will always be some parties for and against any proposal. And often one side is much more passionate than the other in rallying others to their side.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the arbiter's job is to weigh the various arguments from both sides and make a decision.\r\n\r\nThe document currently says that @adg is the arbiter but @adg has been working on some other stuff more lately and doing less day-to-day Go community stuff. I think @rsc (now that he's back) has stepped up as the arbiter.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, the doc could probably say more to set expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
