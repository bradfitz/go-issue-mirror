It's a little contrived because there are\nerrors because my example uses an outside package and so there are more errors, however:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/CDR-Lpn2Wi\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/CDR-Lpn2Wi\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWe see that the error is on line 114: syntax error: unexpected ). The real issue is that\nOptimize on line 13 does not have a closed }. In between there are a constant, type, and\nvariable declarations, none of which would be acceptable in a function before it finally\ntriggers an error for unexpected ). It would be awesome if this error could be more\nlocalized, (closer to line 13), or at least it would look at the whole code to see if\nthere's ever a balanced closed bracket, and then throw an error that there is no\nmatching closed bracket.\u003c/pre\u003e",
