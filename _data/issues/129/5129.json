In this specific case, hypothetically the compiler\ncould realize the error is before line 15, because there are two return statements (line\n10 and 12) otherwise. \n\nI imagine finding the \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; location of the syntax error in the general case\nis hard to do, but I figured I would document the behavior in case something could be\ndone.\u003c/pre\u003e",
