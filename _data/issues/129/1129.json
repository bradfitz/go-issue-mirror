	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. On Windows, open a file (instead of a directory).\n2. Try to call Readdirnames(-1) on it.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nReaddirnames should return ENOTDIR, as it does on Unix.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nI get a dialog box saying \u0026quot;The application foo has caused a problem and needs to be\nquit\u0026quot;, offering to send a report to Microsoft.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows XP.\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nThe Win32 binaries from 2010-08-04.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nWhile I did not try the same thing in the newest build, I checked in hg, and there do\nnot seem to be any commits related to that since august 2010.\n\nThe attached minimal testcase triggers the bug on my system. Run as \u0026quot;testcase\n.\u0026quot;, it works fine, while, say, \u0026quot;testcase testcase.go\u0026quot; does not work.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1129/0/testcase.go\"\u003etestcase.go\u003c/a\u003e (237 bytes)",
