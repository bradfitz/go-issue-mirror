I have not seen\r\nany segmentation faults today, so perhaps that was fixed in a different\r\ncommit. \r\n\r\nnote:\r\n```\r\n$ go version\r\ngo version devel +0f6da89 Wed Jun 3 20:43:51 2015 +0000 linux/amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I note in the commit message, I should not have to buffer the\r\nchannel. My guess is there is some sort of race condition where things\r\ngoing through an unbuffered channel are briefly \"invisible\" to the\r\ngarbage collector. I think that exploring that hypothesis for the error\r\nI was seeing is the best road.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts of the fragmentation issue would be appreciated. It\r\ndefinitely seems to be a real issue.\r\n\r\n",
