Something else is growing.\r\n\r\nDiffing two instances of /proc/pid/maps, I see lots of instances like this:\r\n\r\n    \u003c 7f6670000000-7f667238e000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 \r\n    \u003c 7f667238e000-7f6674000000 ---p 00000000 00:00 0 \r\n    ---\r\n    \u003e 7f6670000000-7f66724e7000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 \r\n    \u003e 7f66724e7000-7f6674000000 ---p 00000000 00:00 0 \r\n\r\nwhich means larger portions of existing anonymous mappings are acquiring backing store.  In this case, ~1.4MB extra in a 64MB mapping.\r\n\r\n1. Are you sure you are unmmapping everything you mmap?\r\n2. Are you using lots of C stack?  These mappings might be C stack, although I think the default Linux stack is 8MB, not 64MB.",
