	"body": "Thanks for testing the CL.  I'm puzzled that we do not see the problem with `Proc.Call` and only see it with `LazyProc.Call`.  I don't see the essential difference between those methods.\r\n\r\nYour tests do suggest that the problem is with `buf`, which is not what I was assuming.  And it's true that the syscall package is careful to always add a call to `use` for any pointer created in a generated function, to force the pointer to escape.\r\n\r\nYou're right, of course, about the stack moving.  cgo works with a moving stack by always ensuring that the arguments escape, which is also what the generated syscall package functions do.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to document this.",
