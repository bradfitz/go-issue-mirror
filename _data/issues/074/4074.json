	"body": "by **jeff.allen**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n1. go tool 6l -a try.6 | head \n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nNothing to stderr, no error. Just exit when SIGPIPE arrives as a result of head closing\nstdin.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\ngo tool 6l: signal 13\n\nSignal 13 is SIGPIPE, used by the OS to tell the writer that the reader isn't listening\nanymore, so it might as well just stop writing. Well behaved programs die on SIGPIPE,\nsilently, because they understand that the later stages of the pipe are asking them to\nquit early.\n\nWhen you run 6l itself, it doesn't complain. The annoying message comes from \u0026quot;go\ntool\u0026quot;.\n\nIn src/cmd/go/tool.go:/^func runTool/ toolCmd.Run() returns an err describing the signal\nthat the child died from. Perhaps signal 13 should be a special case there? Yuck.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\nthe go cmd\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nLinux, 64 bit.\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\n$ hg id\nf2cdaa74b232 tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
