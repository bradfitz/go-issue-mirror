Because it is application responsibility to validate application-level packet integrity when the application uses UDP-like datagram protocols.\r\n```\r\nb := make([]byte, appLevelProtocolDefinedMaximumPayloadLength)\r\nn, err := c.Read(b) // or c.ReadFrom(b)\r\nif err != nil {\r\n        // an error on protocol or protocol service access point occurred\r\n}\r\nif err := validateAppLevelProtocol(b[:n]); err != nil {\r\n        // an error on application-level protocol occurred\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFWIW, you may find it inconsistent to read a UDP datagram with zero-sized payload between platforms and/or kernel versions.",
