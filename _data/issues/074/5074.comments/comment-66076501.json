The issue\ntracker will attach them to the issue correctly, though of course only the first will\nchange the status to Fixed. It is also okay to reopen the issue if you want a reminder\nthat something needs fixing, but if you've already got the fix ready it's okay to skip\nthat step and just mail the fix.\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
