	"body": "I am running go 1.4.1\r\nMy os is ubuntu server 14.04\r\n\r\nWhen running two different unit tests with \"go test\", I get unexpected results, as if it has not rebuilding packages that have changed.\r\n\r\nThis has only happened twice so far.\r\nThe first time go test complained about an import cycle that no longer existed.  After poking at the code for a bit, it suddenly starts running again.  I revert all of my changes and it continues to work fine.\r\n\r\nThe second time I had a test which json marshals a struct, one of the elements was missing in the marshaled string.  When I changed the order of the elements of the struct, the element appeared in the string.  When I reverted it, it continued to work.\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to reproduce this bug as the code currently works fine, and only breaks temporarily.  This has also only happened with those two tests.  All of my other tests work as expected when I change the code.\r\n\r\n",
