(See attached source for \ndetails).\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\nIt doesn't compile because *vector.Vector isn't heap.Interface (in \nparticular, vector.Vector has Push(x vector.Element) and heap.Interface \nwants Push(x interface { }). This is odd because vector.Element is itself \nan empty interface.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nGOOS=linux\nGOARCH=amd64\n\nWhich revision are you sync'ed to?  (hg log -l 1)\n\n3975:b51f...\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/74/0/element.go\"\u003eelement.go\u003c/a\u003e (236 bytes)",
