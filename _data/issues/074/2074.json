	"body": "by **david.jakob.fritz**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Do some work with netchans\n2. Call exporter.Drain() or importer.Drain() between the time the reflect package grabs\nthe data from the actual channel and increments the counter acknowledging it grabbed it.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nDrain() should block until the send completes (receives an ack).\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nDrain() returns immediately (sometimes) as if there are no pending sends.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nGNU/Linux Debian 6\n\nWhich revision are you using?
