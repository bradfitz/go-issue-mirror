It looks like I have to 'go get gopkg.in/v0/qml', but I don't have the qml\ndependencies for that installed and I'd really rather not.\n\nI tried changing the import to just 'import \"C\"', and that produced a binary with the\n.syso inside (as per 'go tool nm') but did not have any problems starting.\n\nIf you can provide a completely standalone case, please file a new issue.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **release-none**, removed **release-go1.4**._\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
