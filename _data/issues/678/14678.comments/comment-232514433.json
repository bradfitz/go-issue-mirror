	"body": "Possibly related issue #13433.\r\n\r\nAlso, FYI (and for my own reference), running cmd/compile with -W -W will dump the nodes list both before and after the \"order\" pass.  E.g., for function foo, it's before-order form is printed as \"before order foo\", and then it's after-order form is printed as \"before foo\".  (\"before foo\" here really means \"before walk foo\", where 'walk' is the compiler's next function pass after 'order'.)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the raw Nod tree dump is very informative, but not very intuitive.  (Aside: If anyone wants to play with prettier ways to print those out, that would be awesome.)",
