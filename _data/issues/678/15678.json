	"body": "I'm not sure how far away Go 1.7 is, but if it is not soon, would it be possible to backport https://github.com/golang/go/commit/2c9d773f7411de211389b9e1da441fae68f826d8 to the next 1.6 point release? As new versions of Chrome roll-out, `go tool trace` is effectively broken.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how heavily used the feature is, but I use it occasionally to trace goroutine execution and syscalls.\r\n\r\nCC @dvyukov ",
