If you\nput runtime.Gosched() into seqMaker() between sending to outChan and finChan, then the\nprogram will deadlock much more frequently even with GOMAXPROCS=1.\nOne way to solve the deadlock is to send exactly 10000 numbers to each channel:\n\nfor k, s := range seqMakers {\n    s.c \u0026lt;- i * i\n    s.n++\n    if s.n == 10000 {\n      close(s.c)\n      delete(seqMakers, k)\n    }\n}\n\nThen you do not need finChan at all, and the program won't deadlock in any conditions.\nIt is now acyclic and deterministic and does not depend on timings.\u003c/pre\u003e",
