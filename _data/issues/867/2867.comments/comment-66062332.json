That's not what the goroutine list printed at deadlock and output of the\nruntime.Goroutines() function would lead me to believe. Those would lead me to believe\nthat the goroutine that should have sent a message on killChan has already exited. Am I\nreading those pieces of information incorrectly?\n\nHere is my own guess for how it blocks: the main goroutine manages to fill up the input\nchannel of one of the seqMakers in between inter-thread/CPU message synchronizations.\nMeanwhile, on the other CPU, the seqMaker has stopped running. \n\nHere, for example, is some output that makes me think that (version attached):\n\nIteration:  2807  Killchan len:  0  Goroutines:  20\nmap[2789:0xf84007f8f0 2796:0xf84007fea0 2806:0xf840084750 2803:0xf8400844e0\n2793:0xf84007fc30 2797:0xf840084000 2800:0xf840084270 2790:0xf84007f9c0\n2801:0xf840084340 2794:0xf84007fd00 2804:0xf8400845b0 2798:0xf8400840d0\n2791:0xf84007fa90 2795:0xf84007fdd0 2805:0xf840084680 2799:0xf8400841a0\n2792:0xf84007fb60 2802:0xf840084410]\nSend to:  2789\nthrow: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!\n\ngoroutine 1 [chan send]:\nmain.main()\n\t/Users/sean/borked2fmt.go:63 +0x511\n\ngoroutine 2 [chan receive]:\nmain.resultsCompiler(0xf840023000, 0xf840004a00, 0x6400000064, 0xf8400019b0, 0x0, ...)\n\t/Users/sean/borked2fmt.go:12 +0x38\ncreated by main.main\n\t/Users/sean/borked2fmt.go:49 +0xe4\n\ngoroutine 2809 [chan receive]:\nmain.seqMaker(0xf840084750, 0xf840023000, 0xaf6, 0xf840014000, 0x0, ...)\n\t/Users/sean/borked2fmt.go:29 +0x8b\ncreated by main.main\n\t/Users/sean/borked2fmt.go:69 +0x5bd\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/2867/10/borked3fmt.go\"\u003eborked3fmt.go\u003c/a\u003e (2203 bytes)",
