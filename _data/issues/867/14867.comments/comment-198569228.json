This should be possible, since the last block in a DEFLATE stream is explicitly marked as such.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, what is the purpose of the Close method, actually? Looking at the implementation in both compress/zlib and compress/flate, it seems to merely return the stored error (if any), but said error will have already been returned by the call that generated it, which a well-behaved client should've also checked.",
