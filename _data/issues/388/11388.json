	"body": "**Go Version:** 1.4.2 linux/amd64\r\n**Operating System:** Ubuntu\r\n**What did you do:** Run GoCover and view HTML report, switch file, then refresh page\r\n**What did you expect:** Update the report with newest version, but remain on selected file\r\n**What did actually happened:** Updated the report with newest version, but returned to alphabetically first file.\r\n\r\nIn the HTML UI for Go Cover, remember what page the user was viewing when the page is refreshed. This is useful when builds are being run automatically and the user wants to see what has changed in the coverage report.\r\n\r\nThis was [originally a discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/AtR50qAcG-s) I started in the Golang-Nuts forum.",
