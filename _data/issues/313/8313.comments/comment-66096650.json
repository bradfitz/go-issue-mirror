Here is what happened:\ngo\\bin wasn't in my PATH environment variable, instead I used a go.bat file as a\nshortcut. This caused the call system(\"go tool addr2line\") to fail, which is why no\nsymbols were available. Though I still don't understand why it should fail if executing\n`go tool addr2line` from the shell works fine.\n\nI guess you can close it.\n\nThanks for your help!\u003c/pre\u003e",
