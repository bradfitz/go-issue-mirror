If the name is just Benchmark and the tool omits the prefix, the name will be blank, which is likely to confuse the user or look like a bug. The Go tool already requires this of benchmark function names.\r\n\r\nInteresting corner case, thanks. Actually the go command _allows_ plain Benchmark. The tool will have to rename it to something. The go command does require that if something follows \"Benchmark\", that something must not be a lower case letter: \"Benchmarked\" is not a benchmark.\r\n\r\n\u003e If this proposal were adopted, however, we could add to the output a config line to disambiguate, \r\n\r\nNice.\r\n\r\n\u003e Will https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/benchmark/parse be updated? Deprecated? Replaced?\r\n\r\nI expect deprecated in favor of a new parser in x/perf (see #14304). The code in package parse is very tied to benchcmp's view of the world (unsurprising since it was basically an mv from cmd/benchcmp). Worse, benchcmp's view of the world - which I accept full blame for - is fundamentally flawed, since it doesn't understand the idea of running a benchmark multiple times and therefore cannot do any statistical validity checks. A general parsing library should really provide something closer to the raw input, leaving analysis to the code invoking the parser. For benchstat, I started by using package parse and trying to recook the results into the form I wanted, but I found that it was easier to parse the raw data from scratch.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, benchstat will move to x/perf, but probably, due to the statistical failings, benchcmp will be left behind, deprecated, and eventually removed. Not for a while though, and somewhat off-topic for the current proposal.",
