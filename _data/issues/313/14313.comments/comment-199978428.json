A header line would give this information:\r\n\r\n```\r\nname                                     iters      time/iter         throughput       allocs              allocs\r\nBenchmarkDecodeDigitsSpeed1e4-8          100        154125 ns/op      64.88 MB/s       40418 B/op          7 allocs/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Apologies for the lousy names.)\r\n\r\nIt's less relevant today because Go benchmarks have a known set (and ordering) of columns, but your format says that this is also a valid benchmark line:\r\n\r\n    BenchmarkFoo     1000        12.34 MB/s\r\n\r\nand without more context one cannot know what the 12.34 MB/s represents. (Compression rate? alloc rate? network throughput?)\r\n\r\nAnyway, as I mentioned, there's plenty of leeway in the specification for anyone to create their own header convention; I was just wondering if it makes sense to prescribe one from the outset.",
