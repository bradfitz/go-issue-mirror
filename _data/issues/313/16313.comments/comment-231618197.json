It can be worked around (in this case, probably by moving to 1.7 so it's really not that hard), but it can be awkward.\r\n\r\nCurrently in Debian, the repo == distribution package is the norm, and works out fine for most things we distribute, although it already results in lots of relatively speaking tiny packages. Splitting x/crypto into 32 separate package or x/net into 24 would be considered at best surprising in this world. You might argue that Debian is broken here, and maybe even be correct, but it still is where we are and won't be quick to fix.\r\n\r\n(Possibly this isn't the ideal forum for this discussion...)",
