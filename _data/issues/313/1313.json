Read the documentation for package fmt; search for the sentence\n   fragment \u0026quot;point or complex value\u0026quot; in the Scanning: section.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n   Something properly laid out. \n\nWhat do you see instead?\n    The fragment \u0026quot;point or complex value\u0026quot; is indented with a grey\n    background -- it is part of a pre block -- and separated from\n    the sentence introduction. Additionally that sentence introduction\n    has been concatenated with the two previous sentences.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\ngodoc!\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nlinux\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\n5101194d056f+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nIt looks like that who region should have been a highlighted pre\nblock, but that there are tabs missing. Or it should have been several\nsentences of plain text, but that newlines are missing and there's\na superfluous tab on the \u0026quot;point or complex\u0026quot; line.\u003c/pre\u003e",
