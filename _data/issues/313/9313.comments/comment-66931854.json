To\nrephrase the\nproblem: the kernel simply doesn't allow you to reserve more VM space than\nthe amount\nof physical memory you have.\n\nAnyway, the ios problem aside, I think the problem is not related to\nphysical memory, but\nrelated to virtual memory space fragmentation. We might not be able to\nreserve a single\n768MB space, but perhaps we can reserve three 256MB space, just not\ncontiguous.\n\nIn general, I think supporting multiple bitmaps is very essential for\n32-bit systems.",
