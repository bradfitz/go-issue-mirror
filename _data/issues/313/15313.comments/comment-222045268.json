And we just found a bug in the code. Obviously f=asminit means that we didn't just go over the switch. But maybe we went over the switch one frame earlier and got out of sync, causing the next frame to pick up a reference to asminit from somewhere. It's equally clear nothing relevant is actually calling asminit, which returns immediately and never makes any calls. asminit's PC shouldn't even appear on the stack (and it only runs on thread startup anyway).\r\n",
