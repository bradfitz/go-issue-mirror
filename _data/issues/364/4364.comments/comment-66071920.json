The standard Unix seconds time given might be wrong (not 15:04:05 MST).\nI thought maybe the output of gnu date might be because you were using a machine in\nCalifornia, but I tried it on a machine in New York and got the same number you did -\n1136239445 - and not the one in our docs. It is possible that gnu date is wrong but\nequally possible we changed the standard time from PST to MST without updating the Unix\nseconds.\n\n2. The docs could be clearer that even if you're formatting a UTC time you still use\n15:04:05 and not whatever that is in UTC.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-later**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to @robpike._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
