What I meant was that,\n\nt1, err := time.Parse(\"02-01-2006 15:04\", \"20-12-2010 06:46\")\n\nif err == nil {\n    fmt.Println(\"Error is nil\")\n    fmt.Println(t1)\n}\n\nOutputs:\nError is nil\nSun Dec 20 06:46:00 +0000 2010\n\nTherefore the call to Parse() in this manner does not consistently return a non-nil\nerror.  However you are correct, the method does do exactly what it says on the tin.  I\ndo not, however, see what the use case is for a method that results in a time structure\nthat does not represent a valid point in time.  Maybe you can provide a use case?\n\nRegards,\nJeffrey Bolle\u003c/pre\u003e",
