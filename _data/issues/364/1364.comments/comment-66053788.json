Weekday may or may not be useful to\nyou, and it's computable from only some combinations of time element values. Therefore,\nit's sensible to apply the rule that only values that you explicitly request are\nreturned as values. Since you requested the time element values in the format, you know\nwhich values are returned. The time Parse function returns sane time element values; it\ndoesn't perform consistency and other validity checks. It leaves that to you.\n\nFor example, a valid and real use case is \"Feb 31\"; it represents a periodic date, the\nlast day of February. Or, \"2011 March 3 Wednesday\" represents the third Wednesday in\nFebruary 2011.\u003c/pre\u003e",
