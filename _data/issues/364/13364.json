	"body": "TestNoteReading fails on the dragonfly builder. It may actually be fine on dragonfly.\nThe builder started failing this test in an unrelated commit tweaking comments in the compiler source code.\nDisabling the test so that maybe the builder can still be useful for finding other problems on dragonfly.\n\nMilestone=Unplanned because dragonfly is not a first-tier system.\nThe dragonfly maintainers can fix this if they like.",
