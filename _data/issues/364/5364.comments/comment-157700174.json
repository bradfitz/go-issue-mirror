It seems like a perfect fit for the SSA compiler.\r\n\r\nFor fun I have created all the cases I can think of, and added it as a [boundscheck.go gist](https://gist.github.com/klauspost/6f5a6ed922c5616c116a). It can be copied directly to the playground.\r\n\r\nMy main thought is that with a SSA tree it would be possible to attach a possible \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" value to each slice and variable. For values that we don't know, or escape, we set it to the maximum/minimum value of the type.\r\n",
