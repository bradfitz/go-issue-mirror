	"body": "I would suggest looking at this problem from the following standpoint: there used to be an issue with garbage collector latency that was too high sometimes. You, as a program developer, could split your executable into several instances and shard data manually between instances if it was possible. Sometimes it is not as easy to shard data though so programs that really need huge heaps, a lot of connections, or both, had to find other ways around it to achieve reasonable GC latency.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion about adding opportunity to specify the fact that you do not care about order of events allows you to avoid doing custom sharding for channels when channel communication is very convenient but becomes a bottleneck. Sometimes distribution of events would be uneven so you need to have some kind of rebalancing sometimes. And the further you go with it the more obvious it becomes that it might be better to solve this problem once and share it with everyone :)",
