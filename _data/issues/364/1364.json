	"body": "by **jeffreybolle**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhen parsing a format string that does not contain a day of the week, i.e.\n\u0026quot;02-01-2006 15:04\u0026quot; the day of the week integer does not get set in the\nresulting time variable.  This means that when you then want to display a format the\ntime variable into a string with a format that does contain a day of the week it\ndefaults to Sunday.\n\nIn my example I parsed 20 Dec 2010, which is a Monday, but the day of the week is set to\n0 (Sunday) in the resulting time variable.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Compile the bug.go file\n2. Run the resulting executable\n3. Note the inconsistency\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nMonday, 20 Dec 2010 06:46\nMonday, 20 Dec 2010 06:46\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nSunday, 20 Dec 2010 06:46\nMonday, 20 Dec 2010 06:46\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nUbuntu 10.10 x86_64\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?
