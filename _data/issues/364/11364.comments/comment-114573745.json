E.g.:\r\n```\r\npackage p\r\nconst _ = 1p10\r\n```\r\nis not accepted anymore:\r\nx.go:2: malformed floating point constant\r\n\r\nHowever, it appears that the numbers are still recognized (and not set to 0 or 1) and then make it through the rest of type-checking/constant evaluation:\r\n```\r\npackage p\r\nconst _ = 1 \u003c\u003c 1p10\r\n```\r\nx.go:2: malformed floating point constant\r\nx.go:2: stupid shift: 1024\r\n\r\nThe fact that we hang in Karatsuba is known and is effectively (indirectly) a duplicate of #11327. But once we set 'p' exponent values to 0, the hang should disappear.\r\n\r\nAssigning to @dr2chase who fixed issue #9036.\r\n",
