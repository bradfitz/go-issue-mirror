Would it be likely to have\nthis as a package if anyone would want to generate a manpage? The design I've come into\nwould let that having a lot of flexibility if the guides on how to comment go commands.\n\nI've also run into a couple of typos in the docs, should I report them or do I fix them\nand submit a CL too?\u003c/pre\u003e",
