	"body": "I'm happy with moving `terminal` to `x/sys`. There might be some tension from the fact that `terminal` mostly implements a line-based input system. That is fairly separate from the utility functions like `GetSize`, `MakeRaw` etc which suggests that the package *might* want to be split in half when moved. Say, into `x/sys/terminal` and `x/sys/terminal/lineterm`. (No thought went into those names.)",
