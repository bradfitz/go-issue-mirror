We also need an API to\nenable SO_PASSCRED on the socket.\n\nSCM_RIGHTS is more tricky. In C there's a bunch of CMSG_* macros for packing in the file\ndescriptors you want to send. See man 3 cmsg. Up until now I've just wrapped these\nmacros with cgo, but that's probably not ideal.\n\nI've written some test code to this stuff. I'll upload it on Monday.\u003c/pre\u003e",
