Might still be worth it to add it:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://codereview.appspot.com/download/issue2331044_53001_54003.diff\"\u003ehttp://codereview.appspot.com/download/issue2331044_53001_54003.diff\u003c/a\u003e\n\nI've also attached a test I have in our local tree for testing the basic stuff in\nsyscall. I think I wrote it before it was easy to test stuff in the syscall package.\n\nIt might be worth it to include these.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1101/17/sockcmsg_unix_test.go\"\u003esockcmsg_unix_test.go\u003c/a\u003e (959 bytes)",
