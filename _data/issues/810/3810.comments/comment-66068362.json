Up until the\nserver sends their own close message, the client can still receive other valid messages.\nProblem is the mainLoop() will receive those and try to send them on the closed\nclientChan msg channel, causing the panic.\nIn my case when the server receives the close, it will send back an \"exit-signal\"\nrequest message before a close, which causes the panic.\u003c/pre\u003e",
