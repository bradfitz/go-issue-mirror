	"body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nnot sure if this is separate issue or not.  My apologizes on nitpicking a sentence but this one confused me.   In the \"Minor changes to the library\" is this\r\n\r\n```\r\ncompress/flate\r\nAs noted above, there are significant performance optimizations throughout the package.\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. It's not \"noted above\".  This is the first mention of `compress/flate`.  Its not noted in the performance section, although this appears to be a 2x improvement in many cases. \r\n2. is this \"significant\" or \"minor\".  The is in the \"minor changes\" section but this is \"significant\". Which is it?\r\n\r\nMaybe a simpler statement such as \r\n\r\n\"There are many performance optimizations throughout the package.\"  \r\n\r\nwould be more clear.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to 1.7\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\nn\r\n\r\n",
