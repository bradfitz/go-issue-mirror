	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n Attached program, configured to point to a Solaris 10 host (havent tested others).\n\n Program runs multiple concurrent ssh connections to a host. For each connection\n there are 2 Run Sessions. Sessions occasionally fail to be created.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n No errors\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n The client logs the following 2 different errors occasionally.\n\nFailed to create session: use of closed network connection\nFailed to create session: ssh: unable to open session: ssh: unexpected packet\n\n And on the server side (Solaris 10 sshd)\n\nsshd[23290]: [ID 800047 auth.info] channel_lookup: 1: bad id: channel free\nsshd[23290]: [ID 800047 auth.info] Disconnecting: Received ieof for nonexistent channel\n1.\nsshd[23305]: [ID 800047 auth.info] channel_lookup: 0: bad id: channel free\nsshd[23305]: [ID 800047 auth.info] Received window adjust for non-open channel 0.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nlinux\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo version go1.0.2\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\n It seems like a race condition triggered by load/concurrency.\n The problem is that the eof on the closed channel causes the connection to be dropped\nby the server, making multiple sessions unreliable.\n If I naively put a check for weClosed before sendWindowAdj and sendEOF in client.go\nthe errors disappear.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3810/0/sshtest.go\"\u003esshtest.go\u003c/a\u003e (1222 bytes)",
