If I add an ```IsNamed() bool``` method to reflect.Type and replace ```v.Type().Name() == \"\"``` with ```v.Type.isNamed()``` in encoding/json/decode.go, it becomes 11% faster than 1.6. So the cost of computing the name in non-empty cases can be significant still in JSON decoding.\r\n\r\nI'm reluctant to propose adding a method for 1.7, as while it's a small change, it's an API change. But maybe for 1.8. Alternatively at the cost of some binary size I can reduce the cost of calculating name, but it is unlikely to ever be as cheap as a boolean method.",
