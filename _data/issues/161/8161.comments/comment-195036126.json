But you could also write that map as a shell script that sets environment variables before invoking the go tool. And there is no obvious way to automatically populate that map.\r\n\r\nIf the Go tool supported a mechanism like this, then maybe distro/OS packaging could populate this in a way that's appropriate for a given environment?
