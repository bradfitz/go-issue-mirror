It's true that when you do that the compiler being used will be recorded.  Once they are built, you can just set GOOS and GOARCH to cross-compile Go code; you don't need to run make.bash again.  You do need to set CC to cross-compile C code, CXX to cross-compile C++ code, etc.\r\n\r\nWe could add a way for the go tool to map from GOOS/GOARCH to the non-Go compilers to use.  But you could also write that map as a shell script that sets environment variables before invoking the go tool.  And there is no obvious way to automatically populate that map.",
