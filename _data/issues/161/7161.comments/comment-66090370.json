(I\nhave an example I've been working with) along with a test gdb script.\n\nSo for example we have gdbtest.go, gdbtest.gdb. In python we make use of doctests or\nunit tests to say something like:\n\"\"\"\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; system(\"go build gdbtest.go\")\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; system(\"gdb gdbtest \u0026lt; gdbtest.gdb\")\n\"\"\"\nWe can then parse the output and verify it matches some regexes. gdbtest.go and\ngdbtest.gdb will need to be kept in sync.\u003c/pre\u003e",
