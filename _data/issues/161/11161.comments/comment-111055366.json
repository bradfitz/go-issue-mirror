For instance, x / y * z is the same as (x / y) * z.\r\n\r\nSo one is  `(a*2)/3` and the other is `a*(2/3)`\r\nWhile it is surprising,  I think this is the correct behavior.\r\n\r\n    func main() {\r\n        a := 0.5\r\n        a = a * 2 + 3\r\n        fmt.Println(a)\r\n\r\n        b := 0.5\r\n        b *= 2 + 3\r\n        fmt.Println(b)\r\n    }\r\nThis should not print the same value. If you think the problem is elsewhere, it would be good to be more specific.",
