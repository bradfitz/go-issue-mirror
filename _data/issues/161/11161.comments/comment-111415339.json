Thanks to both of you.\r\n\r\nA side note: What tripped me in the understanding of this particular part of specs is this\r\n\r\n\u003e Constant expressions are always evaluated exactly; ...\r\n\r\nI just stopped reading after the word *exactly*, as I automatically, but wrongly, assumed it naturaly implies arithmetic commutativity/associativity is granted for the *whole expression* - as is the case with *exact*/symbolic arithmetics, like seen in Maxima or Mathematica or any other CAS.\r\n\r\nI learned that actually the specified exactness works granularly - for every [binary] operation in particular, but then the intermediate result is possibly turned *inexact* by applying a specific domain, eg. â„¤ - with the loss of arithmetic commutativity and/or associativity.\r\n\r\nI can see the reason for this difference wrt to \"ideal\" const expression evaluation and I'm fine with it.\r\n\r\nThanks again to all for the explanation.",
