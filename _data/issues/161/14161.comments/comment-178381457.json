It would be even better if the Go runtime could do it automatically. And this benchmark gives some ideas how to autotune GOGC.\r\n\r\nAn interesting observation is that scaling stopped when GC frequency was somewhere between 80 and 180 times per second (between 32 and 64 threads, 1141 to 2703 GCs in 15 sec). The exact number probably depends on the heap size as well. I wonder if the Go runtime can be clever enough and increase the heap size if GC happens too frequently?",
