	"body": "I think the etcd maintainers should avoid using vendored types in their external APIs. For Context, they should import the official place for it (currently `golang.org/x/net/context`) and ditch their own copy. The package is very unlikely to break (so there's less point in vendoring it), but if it does change then callers of the etcd package will be stuck anyway (since they're the ones supplying the Context).",
