	"body": "/cc @matloob, who is investigating handling memory-constrained situations and load spikes by giving the application more visibility into and control over GC pacing (not by catching OOMs, which I still think is not a technically viable option). The rough idea is that if we can give the application tight-loop control over the GC's heap size target, it can observe its own memory usage (and anything else that might affect this, like other processes in the same container), shed load if it gets too tight, and dynamically trade off more CPU for lower memory overhead by making GC more aggressive.",
