	"body": "If I could get a recoverable panic when memory use hits a pre-defined limit, that would help. This would work OK for applications which are intended to consume most of the memory of a VM/container. This would best be coupled with a way to safely allocate (and dirty) memory until full, then free that memory and report back. That would allow an application to know how much memory is available in the VM/container and then it could set the limit based on that (i.e. 95%). Suggested API:\r\n\r\nruntime.GetAllocateableMemory() uint64\r\nruntime.SetSoftMemoryLimit(maxBytes uint64)\r\n\r\nGetAllocateableMemory() should come with a warning that it will keep allocating memory until failure, can cause massive swapping (then again, only the foolish run with swap:-) and will throw out your page cache.",
