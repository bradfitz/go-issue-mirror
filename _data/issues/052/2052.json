Write a test for package X that depends on Y, and have that test be in package X\n(i.e. not in package X_test).\n4. Build and run the test.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n6l should refuse to link the test due to the cycle.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nOne of two things:\n  - 6l refuses to link the test due to \u0026quot;linker skew\u0026quot;, or\n  - 6l links the test, and the resultant test binary ends up initialising package X twice.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g/6l.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux.\n\nWhich revision are you using?
