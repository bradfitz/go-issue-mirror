I blame Dave ;)\n\n17:26 \u0026lt;davecheney\u0026gt; rcrowley: there is a note on that file that\n                   explains why we can't make the underlying fd\n                   available\n17:27 \u0026lt;davecheney\u0026gt; (or *os.File)\n17:27 \u0026lt;davecheney\u0026gt; because if the blocking mode is changed on that\n                   file, it will screw up the networking code\n\nThat's what I started chasing down, saying \"but dup won't protect you!\". If this is as\nintended, then it's all good with me. (Personally, I'd expect if I .File() a socket, I\nshouldn't touch the original any more, so the \"more threads\" case shouldn't really\ntrigger often.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
