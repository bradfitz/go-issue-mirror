I think to many it seems like D and Go try to fill\nthe same niche. So I think \nclarifying the difference is worth doing. D might seem too obscure to bother with, but I\nthink for the group of \npeople who would get into Go at this stage, D is probably quite well known. It is not\nlike Go is any less obscure \nthan D.\n\nPersonally if I was to sum up the difference then I'd say D is about taking the\nphilosophy behind C++ and doing \nit right, while Go is more about making a very modern version of C (taking cues from\nscript languages).\u003c/pre\u003e",
