	"body": "I just purchased a new MacBook Pro, and installed Go via the `go1.4.2.darwin-amd64-osx10.8.pkg` package on the downloads page. in my zshrc file, I have set the GOPATH and PATH as such:\r\n\r\n    # set Golang working directory\r\n    export GOPATH=/Users/Stuart/go\r\n    export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin\r\n\r\nhowever when I am in zsh (or bash) and I type `which go`, I do not get a PATH printout at all for bash, and I just get `go not found` if using zsh.\r\n\r\nWhen I check to see if `/etc/paths.d/` has a file named go, it does (which apparently means everything installed correct. What I don't understand is when I set the exact same working directory shown above on my old machine, it worked without a hitch.\r\n\r\nLastly, if I manually do an `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin` on the zsh/bash command line **and then** type `which go`, the PATH is set until I close the terminal window.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other questions, please feel free to ask! I want to get this solved :smile: \r\n\r\n-Stu.",
