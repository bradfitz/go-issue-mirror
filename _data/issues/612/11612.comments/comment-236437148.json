All the things described as \"phi optimizations\" in the Braun paper are done during phi construction.  Another way of looking at it, we do what Braun does, but we don't start making phi values until all the blocks are sealed.\r\n\r\nThe one exception is that we don't do the recursive removal they do in tryRmoveTrivialPhi, as we don't have pointers to users in our IR.  I'm open to suggestions as to how to make that work.  Part of the point of phielim is to catch those cases.\r\n\r\nThe \"phi optimization\" pass in our compiler is a separate set of optimizations.",
