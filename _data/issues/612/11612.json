	"body": "uname -a\r\n  Linux nico-Qiana-Xfce 3.13.0-24-generic #47-Ubuntu SMP Fri May 2 23:30:00 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n  go version go1.4.2 linux/amd64\r\n\r\nWhen I click on \"share\" button in Go playground to share the problematic code, it fails with \"server error: try again\" message.\r\nI imagine it is because the source code is too big (~8000 lines).\r\n\r\nBut you can find a small version here:\r\n\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/qpxcVGkzuk\r\n\r\nIt compiles quickly without any problem because it has only 500 lines in the \"samples\" table.\r\n\r\n**But if you copy-paste these sample lines to have 8000 of them in the \"samples\" table, 6g consumes more than 2.5 Gb and then, it is killed, or crashes Virtualbox.**\r\n\r\nThis problem is related to issue \"cmd/go: go build takes too long to compile table driven test code\":\r\n    https://github.com/golang/go/issues/8259\r\n\r\nBut this time, it is not the compile time which is the problem, but the memory consumption, which is really high.\r\nEven with 2.5 Gb of ram allocated to Virtualbox, 6g consumes all the available ram before being killed.\r\n\r\nWith go 1.3.2, I could compile, even if I should allocate at least 2.4 Gb of ram to Virtualbox.\r\n**But with go 1.4.2, the memory consumption has increased so much that I cannot compile the same code any more.**\r\n",
