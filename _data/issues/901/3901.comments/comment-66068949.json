The results may not be what people expect, as for various\nreasons there can be 1, 2, or even 3 variants of a function in gccgo, and they all get\ndifferent names.  The program above prints this with gccgo:\n\nmain f2$descriptorfn returned G\nmain f5$descriptorfn returned O\nmain f3$descriptorfn returned L\nmain f1$descriptorfn returned A\nmain f4$descriptorfn returned N\nmain f2$descriptorfn returned G\nmain $nested0$descriptorfn returned !\n\nI could probably rationalize the names in some way, perhaps even in FuncForPC.\u003c/pre\u003e",
