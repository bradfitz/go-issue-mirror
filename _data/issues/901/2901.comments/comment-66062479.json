If you run your program for a few hours and then\nuse lsof -p \u0026lt;pid\u0026gt; or ls -l /proc/\u0026lt;pid\u0026gt;/fd, you can see the file descriptors\nit\nhas open.  It takes Linux a very long time to run out of file descriptors\n(the max is quite high), so even after a few hours you should see leaked\ndescriptors, just not enough to make ReadFile fail.  Based on exactly which\nfiles have been left open, you might be able to get an idea of where\nthe leak is.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
