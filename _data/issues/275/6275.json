With go release you'll need to pre-compile the C/C++\ncode and link it.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n300 C'Hello';\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\nSometimes something like:\n\n1 CC'Hello';'Hello';\n1\n298 C'Hello';\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\ngo (default)\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nMac OS X 10.8.4 (darwin amd64)\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\ngo version devel +21a81bde7dc9 Wed Aug 28 09:40:08 2013 +1000 darwin/amd64\ngo version go1.1.1 darwin/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nThis doesn't happen every time. You have to run the above code a few dozen times before\nyou get the unexpected output. I have a full library where I was getting this almost\nevery time. The sample seems to be doing it less frequently for some reason.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/6275/0/files.zip\"\u003efiles.zip\u003c/a\u003e (1109 bytes)",
