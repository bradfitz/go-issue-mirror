	"body": "For example, the standard library has a decent encoding/json package, and a great time.Duration object. But these objects don't play well together; if you want to encode a Duration in a json blob, you'll have to make a custom type that calls .String()/ParseDuration() when Get/SetJSON are called. It would be nice if they worked together by default.\r\n\r\n...Unfortunately, the cross product of all the useful encoding packages with all the useful types in the standard library is probably quite large, so I'll understand if you say \"no\" to that. Perhaps at least time.Time and time.Duration could be supported?",
