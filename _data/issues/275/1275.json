	"body": "by **theseeker**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eSource of a simple UDP echo program attached.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nIt should sit and listen on the designated port, print packet size and content on screen\nand echo them back to the sender - at least, that's what it's doing on linux.\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nOn windows, the screen fills with zeros.  ReadFromUDP() is returning immediately without\nerror, but with rbytes == 0.  netstat shows that the program is listening on the port,\nbut nothing happens when I send data to it.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nwindows XP 64\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\ngowin32 release 2010-11-10\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n(*UDPConn).Read() works as expected, but I can not get the remote host info to send data\nback using Read()\n\n(*UDPConn).ReadFrom() is broken in the same manner as ReadFromUDP()\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1275/0/udpecho.go\"\u003eudpecho.go\u003c/a\u003e (846 bytes)",
