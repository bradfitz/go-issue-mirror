How to make a copy of the gbuf and pass that copy to the goroutine thus isolating\nthe bytes and NOT mangling them.\n\nAs has been stated, I have tried many different ways to un-race the code.\n\nFor example:\n\ngtemp := gbuf[0:glen]\n\ngo udpcallbackfunc(gconn, grxadd, glen, gtemp[0:]) \n\nNope, the bytes are STILL mangled.  No way to call a go routine with any combination of\nthe bytes.  \n\nCan you suggest a change to the code?\n\nThx,\n\nmd\u003c/pre\u003e",
