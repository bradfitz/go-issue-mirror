My dumb hypothesis is that;\r\n1) some agent software makes /etc/hosts empty temporarily for some reason\r\n2) built-in stub resolver reads the empty /etc/hosts file and has no record\r\n3) built-in stub resolver throws a query to some full resolver\r\n4) the full resolver replies its local-data/local-zone RR, which contains \"127.in-addr.arpa. IN SOA localhost. nobody.invalid.\"\r\n5) TestLookupDotsWithLocalSource barks at \"localhost.\"",
