	"body": "I think I've found the problem.  There seems to be a bug in cgocallback_gofunc in asm_arm.s and asm_arm64.s: they never call dropm.  The effect is that a C thread can incorrectly have the g TLS variable set, causing Go to think that the signal stack should be set up, although it is not.  If g were nil, as it should be, the code would have called badsignal.  That sounds bad, but since the signal in question is SIGCHLD nothing actually happens.",
