	"body": "gcimporter does not fail gracefully when it encounters old versions. This trips up a lot of people--they think it's a bug, and do not think to re-install the relevant packages (why would they?). Related bugs: #16879 and #16859 and #16112 and #15728 and #16826 and #16781 and lots more. I think at this point some kind of fix, even a kludgy one, is called for.\r\n\r\nThe best case scenario, to my mind, is that importers just work (#10276). Failing that, gcimporter should treat the input package as potentially hostile (i.e. as user input) and on error, suggest a package re-install. Failing that, gcimporter should explicitly check for and recognize known prior versions and suggest a package re-install.\r\n\r\n",
