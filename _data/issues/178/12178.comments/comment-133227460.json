It's creating a section named \".note.go.buildid\".  The\nABI doesn't say anything about such a section.\n\nAlso, the ABI defines a PT_NOTE segment.  Both the GNU linker and gold\nwill take a SHF_ALLOC SHT_NOTE section and put it into a PT_NOTE\nsegment.  Is there any way to tell the Solaris linker to create a\nPT_NOTE segment?\n\n\n\u003e use a .data or other \"expected\" allocable section entry instead of a .note\n\u003e section to store the buildid\n\nThis seems like the simplest solution if there is no way to create a\nPT_NOTE segment.  I think we would probably want a .text section so\nthat it goes very early in the binary.\n\nIan\n",
