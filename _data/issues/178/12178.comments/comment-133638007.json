On GNU/Linux SHT_NOTE is appropriate--it's convenient for readelf and objdump, for example--but if Solaris needs something else, we should use something else.\r\n\r\nThat's fine by me; as I said, future versions of Solaris will attempt to more closely mimic the GNU linker's behaviour, but for the foreseeable future, we'll have to pursue another solution for Go.\r\n\r\nI'll see what I can come up with using a different section type instead of SHT_NOTE.  Thanks for your patience.",
