I'm now a happy owner of an 8g executable.\n\n[...]\n[pid 17927] execve(\"~/install/go/bin/quietgcc\", [\"quietgcc\", \"-ggdb\", \"-I/home/u\nlli/go/include\", \"-O2\", \"-fno-inline\", \"-c\", \"/home/ulli/go/src/lib9/_p9dir.c\"]\n[...]\n= -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\n\nIt seems that the execve() call does not use the full path with ~ expanded to the\nvalue of $HOME.  Since it is (I presume) \"make\" that makes the system call, there\nprobably is no bug in \"go\".\n\nReplacing the ~/install/go/bin entry in my PATH with the full, explicit path solved\nthe problem.  (Yet I've never needed to do that until now.)  $GOBIN has always\npointed to the explicit path value, which again I interpret as this not being a \"go\"\nspecific problem.\n\nAnyway, the install instructions should probably mention that $PATH always needs to\ninclude the full path, so others will not encounter the same problem.  Whom should I\nemail for that?\u003c/pre\u003e",
