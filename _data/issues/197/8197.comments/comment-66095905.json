In this case, they will run slower, but at\nleast they won't crash. \n\nIf implemented, it would make sense to keep this compatibility hack for a couple of\nkernel releases (say, until 3.18), until most of the actively-being-worked-on Go\nprograms are recompiled, and then just drop the hack.\n\n* again, that's not a well-thought proposal and I don't even know, if such behavior is\nappropriate for the kernel even on a temporary basis. Also, I don't see an easy marker\nto detect the binaries affected by the bug *\u003c/pre\u003e",
