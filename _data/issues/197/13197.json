	"body": "go get -insecure doesn't accept self-signed (or otherwise invalid) TLS certificates. Instead, it falls back to HTTP. This does not work for HTTPS-only hosts. Insecure should accept any insecure medium, not just those that are insecure because they are unencrypted.\r\n\r\nExample that is only serving HTTPS, with a self-signed certificate:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go get -v -insecure 127.0.0.1/pkg\r\nFetching https://127.0.0.1/pkg?go-get=1\r\nhttps fetch failed.\r\nFetching http://127.0.0.1/pkg?go-get=1\r\nimport \"127.0.0.1/pkg\": http/https fetch: Get http://127.0.0.1/pkg?go-get=1: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:80: getsockopt: connection refused\r\npackage 127.0.0.1/pkg: unrecognized import path \"127.0.0.1/pkg\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nLow priority from my end, as it's a theoretical issue, not one I encountered in the real world. Discovered while looking into #11468",
