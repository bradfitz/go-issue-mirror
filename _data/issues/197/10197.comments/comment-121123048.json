	"body": "The bug only affects people or programs that:\n\n  1. invoke the compiler directly\n  2. do so in directories containing spaces\n  3. have local imports (import \"./foo\") in their programs\n  4. do not specify a -D flag to set the local import prefix\n\nThat's a lot of conditions. It's true that fixedbugs/bug248.go\nruns into this, as does fixedbugs/bug369.go, but probably\nthe fix should be to correct those tests, not to make larger\nchanges.\n\nNote that the go command does work fine, because it\narranges to use a sanitized version of the local directory\nin the path to the compiled artifacts, and it instructs the\ncompiler to use that sanitized version with -D.\n\nWe should still fix the tests, but this is not blocking\nany release.",
