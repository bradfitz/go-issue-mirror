We've also taken care to avoid this problem in the usual case -- notice that \"go run main.go\" processes the import without complaint.  This looks more like an artifact than a policy, but it's an artifact that appears if someone attempts a standard go clone+build at a path name with a space in it.\r\n\r\nEven if it is a policy, I don't think it makes sense to exclude spaces.  Windows/Linux/Mac treat spaces unexceptionally.  I ran a find command on the root of my (relatively fresh Mac laptop) file system and found over 1000 directories with a space in their name, while #$@^%~:;=+?|\"`'{}[]\u003c\u003e,*\\ combined appeared in only 44 directory names.  28 had ( and 28 had ) -- probably the same 28.",
