Based on the code, I don't imagine it's specific to 10.8 or 10.7, but if\nyou want to test it and have the code review plugin setup for Mecurial\n(\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/contribute.html)\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/contribute.html)\u003c/a\u003e, just run: hg clpatch 6446060\n\nMy one remaining concern is that darwin defined uuid_t as 16 characters whereas Go\ndefines it as 20, as above. That strikes me as a bit odd, though isn't the cause of this\nissue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
