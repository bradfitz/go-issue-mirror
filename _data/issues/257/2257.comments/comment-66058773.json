One of the differences is that the old\nregexp allowed '.' to match a newline character, while exp/regexp\nby default does not (nor do Perl and its progeny) To allow '.' to \nmatch newline, begin the regexp by turning on the 's' flag:\n\n`(?s)^(.*)$`\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @rsc._\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
