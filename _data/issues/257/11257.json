	"body": "This is an extraction from #11254.\r\n\r\nHaving the package prefix in examples is clearer than omitting it. Since examples must not make use of unexported functionality anyway, it is always ok to have them in an external test package. Let's move all examples to external test packages.\r\n\r\nIf Go 1 compatibility didn't prevent it, I'd suggest that we modify the testing package to enforce this.\r\n",
