	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eOne line in the Go spec says:\n  A nil map is equivalent to an empty map except that no elements may be added.\n\nThat led me to believe that deletion from a nil map should work.  But another line in\nthe spec says:\n  If the element m[k] does not exist, delete is a no-op. Calling delete with a nil map causes a run-time panic.\n\nWhile this is clear, it appears to contradict the first statement.  Can we improve the\nfirst statement?\u003c/pre\u003e",
