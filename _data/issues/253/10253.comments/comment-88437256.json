	"body": "Checking out commit ```11dba2ec2d8f``` (last known ok build) I notice that the generated unoptimized code is studiously avoiding using R0 anywhere. It also has a tendency to start functions at R7. After the breaking change, register numbering becomes far more normal, beginning at R0.\r\n\r\nI modified the tip implementation of cgen OINDEX so it looks like it did at ```11dba2ec2d8f```. The result was the exact same code for the implementation of ```eq```, except the registers are numbered from R0 instead of R7. The resulting programs crash very early in the runtime trying to index into arrays.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is the object code generated for R0 is wrong. But it seems neither 7l -a nor objdump work with arm64?? How are you debugging output?",
