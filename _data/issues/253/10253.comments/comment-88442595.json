	"body": "The R7 vs. R0 thing is a red herring. Traditionally, the temp set was slightly larger than the reg var set. Perhaps this mattered at some point, but it didn't matter now, so @rsc removed this distinction when consolidating all registerizers into the portable registerizer, making the two sets equal.\r\n\r\nThis exposed this bug. The bug was (probably) present before, but because there was a big enough difference between the two sets, temporary registers never clashed with register variables. Now they compete for the same registers and the bug is visible.\r\n\r\n7l -a hasn't worked in over a year and a half since we have had liblink or its Go successor. Objdump, GNU objdump that is, works with arm64 binaries provided you compile it with support for the target. Obviously the native objdump present on arm64 linux has this property, but you can compile binutils with arm64 support on any system.\r\n",
