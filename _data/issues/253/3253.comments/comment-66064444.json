It looks to be an issue\nwith extern pointers, in the simple example I have provided, an extern int works fine,\nbut an extern *int doesn't.\n\nI'm fairly certain this only happens when ld is trying to link gcc compiled code\nstatically, since we would have run into this problem with most cgo libraries otherwise.\n\nI think this issue is relatively high priority since it seems to affect all darwin\nbuilds, and makes providing custom C-code to packages (that can be built trivially with\nthe go tool) a potential minefield for portability.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3253/2/foo.zip\"\u003efoo.zip\u003c/a\u003e (1562 bytes)",
