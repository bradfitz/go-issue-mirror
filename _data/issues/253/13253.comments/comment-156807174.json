My point is that I think this is what users actually want. To me, strided slices as proposed don't appear to offer any very significant advantage over slices of slices, [][]T. In my eyes, the benefit does not justify the cost.\r\n\r\n(Incidentally, it is of course possible to build a type with functionality equivalent to numpy ndarray or torch tensor in golang. The thing that I as a user want is the syntactic sugar to make such a thing more pleasant to use.)",
