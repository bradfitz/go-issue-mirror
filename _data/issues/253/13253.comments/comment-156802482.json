	"body": "The following are a couple of features that are important in machine learning applications, and that I would be interested to understand whether strided slices can support. (These features are supported by numpy ndarrays and torch tensors, for example.)\r\n- The ability to manipulate the \"shape\" of the multi-dimensional array on the same underlying data. For example, given a [30] slice, to construct a [5,6] slice on the same data; given a [5,6] slice, to construct a [6,5] slice which represents the transpose. These are all operations which amount to having different strides on the same data.\r\n- The ability to subslice along any dimension, not only the first. For example, given a [h,w] slice, to select either a [h',w] subslice or a [h,w'] subslice or a [h',w'] subslice.\r\n\r\nIn order to implement these requirements, I think the internal representation would need to be something more like this:\r\nstruct {\r\ndata []T\r\nshape []int\r\nstride []int\r\n}",
