In fact, transpose is one of the three methods in the matrix interface (https://godoc.org/github.com/gonum/matrix/mat64#Matrix). We want to support nearly cost-free transposes without having to copy.\r\n\r\nReshaping is not the same thing as transpose, even with a copy. Take the linear elements 0-7 as a 2 x 4 matrix\r\n````\r\n0 1 2 3 \r\n4 5 6 7\r\n````\r\nIf we reshape this to a 2x4 matrix, we get\r\n````\r\n0 1\r\n2 3\r\n4 5\r\n6 7\r\n````\r\nwhich is not the same thing as taking a transpose of the 2x4 matrix. Transpose is a distinct operation.\r\n\r\n@nsf [128][64][64]float64 is indeed an array, but *[128][64][64]float64 is a pointer to a fixed-size array.",
