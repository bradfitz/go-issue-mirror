	"body": "@btracey The main use case I have for reshaping is as follows:\r\nI work with neural networks, and the input is often image data, with shape (c, h, w) (c = number of channels, eg 3 for colour). It needs to be this shape to pass through convolutional layers, ending up as shape (c', h', w'). But it then needs to pass through linear layers, so it needs to be reshaped to (c' x h' x w'). And then for the backward pass, that reshaping needs to happen in reverse.\r\n\r\nTransposing is also used in neural networks. We use a weight matrix on the forward pass, and its transpose on the backward pass. (Admittedly, there are ways round this.)\r\n\r\nPlease can you explain your comment \"The ability to reshape easily and the ability to take views easily are basically mutually exclusive without some wrangling\". Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what you mean, but I would say that both numpy ndarray and torch tensor offer this functionality.",
