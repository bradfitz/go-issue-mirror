	"body": "Yes, you can do that, but then you need n strides for n-dimensional data. All of the proposals have n-1 strides for an n-dimensional slice. \r\n\r\nWhile nice in theory, you lose a lot of speed that way. You want to guarantee at least one of the strides is 1 so you can take advantage of SIMD and caches (and even simpler, range). Row vs. Column major is a very good example of 'worse-is-better'. It sounds nice to allow both, but then every higher-level has to be written to support both orderings. Much better to choose and fix one, and then find how to support common operations efficiently (like we have with Transpose).",
