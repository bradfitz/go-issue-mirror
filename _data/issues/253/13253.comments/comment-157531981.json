Despite your comment to the contrary, I don't believe your proposal does allow this without significant extra work, obviating the benefits of the proposal.\r\n\r\nYou may contend that the sensible approach might have been to copy the views, perform the operations and copy back (assuming the case that the matrix cannot be treated as a collection of separable systems, in which case they should just be separate), but how? The absence of a capacity to make a rectangular view hampers this as well.",
