To rephrase at a lower level, it is not possible to reshape a tensor where the stride does not match the width (for row major matrices this means matrices where cols != stride) without copying, since there are regions in the linear representation of the tensor that are not in the tensor. I doubt numpy or torch take views in the way @btracey intends (a quick look at numpy.ndarry.view confirms this).\n",
