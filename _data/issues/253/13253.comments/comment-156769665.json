	"body": "Oh, small correction. I mentioned syntax for fixed-size strided slices as `[128,64,64]int`, but it uses dimensions, not stride values. What I said about dimensions and strides applies. Perhaps for readability sake it would be a good idea to make it this way. `[128,64,64]int` in terms of dimensions means `[4096,64,1]int` in terms of strides. Another example why calculating strides by hand is not fun at all, compiler can do that for us.",
