This means that the comment for Synopsis is now incorrect wrt\ndefinition of the string end point (in addition to the returned string not being a\nsentence):\n\n// Synopsis returns a cleaned version of the first sentence in s.\n// That sentence ends after the first period followed by space and\n// not preceded by exactly one uppercase letter. The result string\n// has no \\n, \\r, or \\t characters and uses only single spaces between\n// words. If s starts with any of the IllegalPrefixes, the result\n// is the empty string.\u003c/pre\u003e",
