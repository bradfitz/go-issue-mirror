One of the reasons my\npatch was ugly and long was that I assumed we'd want to write the 400 with a Body\nindicating what went wrong, along with maybe Date, Content-Type, Content-Length, and\nprobably \"Connection: close\" headers. We have code for that, but it requires a *response\nand a Request, and trying to fulfill that needs even when ReadRequest failed lead me\ndown a bumpy, awkward road.\nGranted, you could just add a \"Bad Request\" to the end of the Fprintf string, but I have\nno idea what the spec or accepted browser/cache behavior says about that. \n\n\nAlso, the one-liner you propose sends a 400 for ErrHijacked, ErrNotSupported,\nErrUnexpectedEOF, and others. \nIn my change I tried to avoid sending for any other than the few cases in ReadRequest I\nwas sure about, and that added some complexity. However, sending a 400 is likely better\nthan dropping the request silently for most errors, and is certainly entirely correct\nfor at least some of them. \n\nAnyway, my fix was thrown together relatively quickly, and was certainly more\ncomplicated than necessary as a result of my assumptions and assumed requirements. You\nknow better than I what assumptions are safe and what requirements are reasonable, so if\nyou think it can be done simpler, it almost certainly can be.\u003c/pre\u003e",
