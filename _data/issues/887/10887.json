	"body": "go version 1.4.2, Linux x64\r\n\r\nWhen trying to form an URL with escaped \"/\" (%2F) the handling in net/url either removes the escaping or does double escaping (in which case the requested URL is wrong).\r\n\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/1vDHT_p-cZ\r\n\r\nThe same issue of course makes calling the http.NewRequest also impossible as the given URL is not honored (escaped characters are removed, since the method calls url.Parse) and the wrong URL is called on the other end.\r\n\r\nExpected result: QueryEscaped URL should not be modified. Has resemblance to issue #2782",
