A consequence is that it is impossible to tell which slashes in the\nPath were slashes in the raw URL and which were %2f. This distinction is\nrarely important, but when it is a client must use other routines to parse\nthe raw URL or construct the parsed URL. For example, an HTTP server can\nconsult req.RequestURI, and an HTTP client can use URL{Host: \"example.com\",\nOpaque: \"//example.com/Go%2f\"} instead of URL{Host: \"example.com\", Path:\n\"/Go/\"}.\n",
