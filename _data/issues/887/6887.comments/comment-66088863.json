Is 'rename' supposed to be synonymous with 'move' - I would have expected a\nseparate function 'move' - to fix that would require more work and a gofix issue..\n\nAs it stands the suggestion made above for should do for the docs,  ie add to the bottom\n\n\"Strings 'oldname' and 'newname' must be supplied as full file paths\"\n\nI'm assuming that the behaviour in windows when 'newname' us supplied with a just a new\nfilename is not intended and would not be consistent across other OSs - so not to\nattempt to document it.\n\nHowever I would prefer to error check. See above for more details.\u003c/pre\u003e",
