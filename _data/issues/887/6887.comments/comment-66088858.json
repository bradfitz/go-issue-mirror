That seems most reasonable and less surprising to me.\n\nI don't see what else Rename documentation can say, given that we don't actually\nimplement that function ourselves, but use OS for the service.\n\nPlease, make a new doc suggestion for a consideration. Thank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
