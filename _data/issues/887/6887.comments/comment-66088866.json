And if you give a relative path, the correct thing will happen, i.e.\nthe file path is treated relative to the current working directory.\n\nTo clear things up, I propose we change both names of the argument to contain\nthe word \"path\", and also mention OS-specific restrictions, like this:\n\n// Rename renames a file. OS-specific restrictions might apply.\nfunc Rename(oldpath, newpath string) error\u003c/pre\u003e",
