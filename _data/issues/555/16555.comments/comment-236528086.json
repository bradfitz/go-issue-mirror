I have no clue, must be a weird composition of some configurations/registry|network settings by all the installed programms (including MS Network Monitor, Wireshark, TeamViewer, Nmap, ...) on my machine i guess.\r\n\r\nI also tried to debug net/httptest (Intellij Webstorm works great), but i have no idea where to look at. Also i am confused about the connection states: in windows i got 2 connections with state \"established\" but the go program says, 1 idle connection, for me this are 2 different things.",
