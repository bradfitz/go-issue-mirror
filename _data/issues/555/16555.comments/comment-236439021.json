Further more i have a lot of network adapters due to vmware/virtualbox, so i disabled all of them, except my real network card. Didn't helped either. Between these investigations, i restartet my pc, also flushed dns.\r\n\r\nSome more background info, of my pc \u0026 work process: starting up, i type in the password to decrypt my HDDs (TrueCrypt). Then i start the git shell (git-bash.exe on windows), there i have to type in the passphrase for my public key (so a ssh-Agent is initialized). After that, i chenge to my go-Coding Directory (in shell), and run the main.go as described.\r\n\r\nMaybe i sould check some things like VPN Adapters? (Was not connected, but there are windows services in the background) Or general check Windows-Services..\r\n\r\nAny suggestions/hints/ideas for further investigations are welcome :)\r\n",
