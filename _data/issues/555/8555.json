If you add a single test case to `foo_test.go`,\nthen it errors as expected. I believe that this was not the behavior with Go 1.2 but\nhaven't verified. I have a lot of test cases for really basic packages that I just want\nto test compilation, and it no longer is testing that, when it was before.\u003c/pre\u003e",
