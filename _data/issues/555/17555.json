	"body": "Many contributors don't assign a reviewer to their CLs, either because they don't think they need to or they don't know who would be a good reviewer. In theory, those CLs are supposed to get promptly triaged and assigned reviewers. In practice, they aren't, and CLs fall through the cracks.\r\n\r\nI suggest that when 'git mail' is invoked without specifying a reviewer with the `-r` flag, it automatically selects one.\r\n\r\nThe selection algorithm can be tuned over time, but as an initial pass, I'd suggest a recency-weighted sum of who has committed to and/or reviewed the files touched by the CL, falling back to directories/parent directories as needed for new files/directories. The initial reviewer can always redirect to another reviewer if the algorithm guesses wrong.\r\n\r\nIf the CL contains DO NOT REVIEW or DO NOT SUBMIT, it will not automatically select a reviewer.\r\n\r\nThis won't help with people who don't use git-codereview. An alternative that would cover them is to set up a bot that monitors CLs and does the automatic reviewer assignment. Doing it in git-codereview seems simpler and easier and probably sufficient, though.\r\n\r\nFeedback requested.\r\n\r\ncc @bradfitz @adg @quentinmit @spf13 \r\n",
