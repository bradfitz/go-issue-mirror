I'm guessing that the installer did its job, and that the environment variables were altered, but that running the command prompt after the install did not pick those changes up yet. I probably (incorrectly) assumed that the env vars were not changed because of that. It would explain why I now have the directory in both the system PATH as my personal PATH.",
