	"body": "%PATH% contains lots of directories, but was not altered to include the Go bin directory, I should have added it to the initial report. I have now been playing with the PATH and am no longer sure what the state was before the changes. This is the PATH now (\u003c...\u003e means is edited):\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\\u003c...\u003e;C:\\Oracle\\\u003c...\u003e\\system32;C:\\Windows;C:\\Windows\\System32\\Wbem;C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\\u003c...\u003e\\;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\QuickTime\\QTSystem\\;C:\\Program Files\\\u003c...\u003e\\bin;C:\\Program Files(x86)\\Skype\\Phone\\;C:\\Go\\bin;;C:\\Program Files\\Docker Toolbox\\;C:\\Go\\bin\r\n\r\nI notice that the C:\\Go\\bin is listed twice. The last 2 directories are from my personal account PATH, the rest is the system PATH (the double ;; is the delimiter). I added the last dir (C:\\Go\\bin) manually. I cannot confirm with 100% confidence that the Go bin dir that is now twice in the Path (actually the system PATH ends with the go bin dir) was not there a few days ago, i no longer have the terminal open.\r\n\r\nOS info:\r\n\r\nOS Name:                   Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise\r\nOS Version:                6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601",
