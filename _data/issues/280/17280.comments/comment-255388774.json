Please ignore the stuff about `LabelsFromContext`.\r\n\r\nBut I don't see why `runtime/pprof.DoWithLabels` wouldn't allow the user to manage profiling labels entirely in conjunction with a `context.Context value. The only difference between `context.DoWithLabels` (from the proposal) and the proposal `runtime/pprof.DoWithLabels` is the package the function is located in. They'd work with the context type the same way.",
