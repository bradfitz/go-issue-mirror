	"body": "Hah: HAProxy documents this,\r\n\r\nhttps://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.5.html#4-option%20httpchk\r\n\r\nBut it's pretty trashy how it overloads the `\u003cversion\u003e` field:\r\n\r\n```\r\noption httpchk \u003cmethod\u003e \u003curi\u003e \u003cversion\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cmethod\u003e  is the optional HTTP method used with the requests. When not set,\r\n          the \"OPTIONS\" method is used, as it generally requires low server\r\n          processing and is easy to filter out from the logs. Any method\r\n          may be used, though it is not recommended to invent non-standard\r\n          ones.\r\n\r\n\u003curi\u003e     is the URI referenced in the HTTP requests. It defaults to \" / \"\r\n          which is accessible by default on almost any server, but may be\r\n          changed to any other URI. Query strings are permitted.\r\n\r\n\u003cversion\u003e is the optional HTTP version string. It defaults to \"HTTP/1.0\"\r\n          but some servers might behave incorrectly in HTTP 1.0, so turning\r\n          it to HTTP/1.1 may sometimes help. Note that the Host field is\r\n          mandatory in HTTP/1.1, and as a trick, it is possible to pass it\r\n          after \"\\r\\n\" following the version string.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHAProxy should just add the Host header automatically for HTTP/1.1, really. Or if it wants to provide a mechanism for additional headers, it should be part of the `httpchk` syntax, not tacking it onto `\u003cversion\u003e`\r\n\r\nBut whatever. Wrong bug tracker for that.\r\n",
