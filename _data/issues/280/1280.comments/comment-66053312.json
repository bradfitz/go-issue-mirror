I'm\ntrying to make a .deb and an .ebuild, and in both cases, I have not been able to find\nthe right combination of GOROOT, GOROOT_FINAL, GOBIN at compile time that doesn't either\ncause segfault's of some apps (ebnflitn, dodoc, and a handful of others.\n\n*** It is only the binaries buily using GOROOT_FINAL that are segfaulting for me. ***\n\nPersonally, I'm happy using a Go install in it's src dir for my own projects.\n\nHowever, I'd really appreciate a clear example of:\n1) Which variables to set for a \"moved install\" (i.e. use of GOROOT_FINAL)\n2) Which directories in the repo are needed for apps to work -- gotry required Make.inc,\nfor e.g.\n\nIf a \"moved install\" -- really, what GNU autotools considers DESTDIR -- works for you,\nI'd love to see the steps you followed to produce a working set of tools.\u003c/pre\u003e",
