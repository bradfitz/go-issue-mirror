	"body": "by **armando.dicianno**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. amd64, linux on a basic Gentoo install (nothing fancy or weird), gcc-4.4.4, multilib\n2. hg clone go\n3. cd go/src ; ./all.bash\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nWhatever success is!\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n--- cd cmd/ebnflint\nebnflint -start=\u0026quot;SourceFile\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;/home/fafhrd/Projects/go/repos/go\u0026quot;/doc/go_spec.html\nmake: *** [test] Segmentation fault\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nThis is during install, so whatever that is internally (6g?); I tried with no GOARCH or\nGOOS and then GOARCH=amd64 and GOOS=linux.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nGentoo Linux. I have a very basic amd64 install. gcc-4.4.4 (gentoo -r2)\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\na7800e20064a tip\n\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI spent some time writing an ebuild for wider use. In my tests for seeing what files\nwere needed (GOROOT v. GOROOT_FINAL), I noticed that godoc also segfaults -- this will\nend up being a different bug, I'm sure. ;-) However, it may be related.\n\n-----------\n\nFeel free to let me know about further system or debugging information you need. While\nI'm very new to Go, I generally know how to invoke and use various development tools --\nI just don't know what I'm looking for in this case.\u003c/pre\u003e",
