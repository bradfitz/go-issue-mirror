If I run `GOARM=5 ./make.bash` it compiles the standard library into `pkg/linux_arm`, which is then overwritten by `GOARM=6 ./make.bash`.\r\n\r\nAm I supposed to just build the standard library with another script, and then manually use `-installsuffix`? And if so, how do I select the right standard library while compiling an application?",
