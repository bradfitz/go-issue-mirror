In my applications I would not withstand a 2.4x slowdown (however using Go's code generation the ratio could turn out to be different). If I understand correctly Errol can remove the need for big number arithmetic entirely, so it could be a fallback to Grisu3 without so much code size inflation, and it would be quite useful because if 1 number out of 200 is 300 times slower to process, the impact is far from negligible.",
