After the user is in, the auth\nis never repeated, so the only way to effect a revocation is to kill an existing\nsession.  The cache has no role in this.\n\nRegarding the connection level view, ServerConn.Handshake() returns the connection-level\nauth errors; can you log that error instead?\u003c/pre\u003e",
