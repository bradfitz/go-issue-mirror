But after\nthat, the callback used for public key auth doesn't contain any information I can use to\nidentify that to the initial handshake, and then to the eventual success or failure of\nthe authentication for the connection.\n\nThe Handshake does have the error that takes a connection level view, but that doesn't\nhelp me if I get a single connection that tries many times, or control within the\ncallback. Even just passing into the public key auth callback a unique int ID or a\nsettable interface would be appreciated.\u003c/pre\u003e",
