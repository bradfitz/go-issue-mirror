Additionally, the\n   implementation SHOULD limit the number of failed authentication\n   attempts a client may perform in a single session (the RECOMMENDED\n   limit is 20 attempts).  If the threshold is exceeded, the server\n   SHOULD disconnect.\n\nI don't think this should be hardcoded (it is not currently), but it should be able to\nbe implemented.\u003c/pre\u003e",
