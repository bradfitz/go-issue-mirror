It should print to stderr or\nits equivalent if there's a problem to report.\n\nFile descriptor 2 is there for this purpose.  There is no better place to print.  \n/dev/tty means you can't capture it, and anyway that's even more Unix-specific.\n\nI don't think this is a Go-specific problem, this is a problem in any environment that\nuses Unix.  I think the issue should be closed, as soon as the stdout problem (if it\nexists) is fixed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
