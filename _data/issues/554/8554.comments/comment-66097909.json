It's just a library function.  It has\nto make some specific choices, and those choices have been made.  If you don't like the\nchoices that it makes, then write your own version.  You describe that as copying large\nparts of the runtime, but it's not.  It's about 140 lines of Go code, including\ncomments.  Writing your own version means writing an equality function that serves your\nspecific needs, something that is done routinely for cases where reflect.DeepEqual is\ninsufficient or incorrect.\n\nYou describe not supporting your particular use case as a \"missed feature.\"  You're\nright: it is a missed feature.  There are, in that sense, many missing features in Go. \nWhat's important for Go libraries is not providing every feature, but providing all the\ntools you need to make your program work.\u003c/pre\u003e",
