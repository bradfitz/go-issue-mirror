There are\nalways few options though:\n1. Change the behaviour because the the existing behaviour is not correct/wanted.\n2. Introduce a new function that has deals differently with structs with function fields\n(e.g. my proposal to ignore the functions)\n3. Warn users that behaviour will change in the future and do 1. at a later stage.\n\nMy argument is that when dealing with function pointers the DeepEqual is useful is so\nfew cases a change is warranted. Anyone relying on current behaviour will have some\nfuzziness to deal with, since 'false' can mean either actually not equal or some\nfunction was not nil. My guess is that anyone who uses functions as struct properties\navoids DeepEqual.\n\nI currently have to copy over the DeepEqual source code including all the private\nfunctions in order to get useful behaviour.\u003c/pre\u003e",
