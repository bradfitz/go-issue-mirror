	"body": "Yes, that can be a concern, because ordering imposed by timestamps must be consistent with causal ordering of events. For example, if a goroutine is started at the same tick it was created, it can cause inconsistent trace.\r\nYes, it can make sense to have different traceTickDiv values on different archs.\r\nSomebody needs to investigate this on ppc64. Does reducing the value fixes trace tests? What is the right value?\r\nAnd yes, the tradeoff is that smaller traceTickDiv values increase trace size. If time difference between consecutive events is less than 128, than timestamp occupies 1 byte, otherwise 2+ bytes.",
