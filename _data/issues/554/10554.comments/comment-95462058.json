The contents of the Time Base differ by no more than +/- four counts from\r\nwhat they would be if they incremented at the required frequency.\r\n2. Bit 63 of the Time Base is set to 1 between 30% and 70% of the time over\r\nany time interval of at least 16 counts.\r\n....\r\nThe Time Base update frequency is not required to be constant.\r\n\r\nI guess we can first try 64 on x86, 16 on ppc, and 16 for other platforms\r\n(e.g. arm, arm64) where cputicks is emulated by runtime.nanotime.\r\n",
