First of all, the tutorial explicitly says that you can\nimport \nfmt the second way, but that the first is a less idiomatic way of doing the same thing: \n\n\"The import statement is actually a declaration: in its general form, as used in our \n``hello world'' program, it names the identifier (fmt) that will be used to access \nmembers of the package imported from the file (\"fmt\"), found in the current directory \nor in a standard location. In this program, though, we've dropped the explicit name \nfrom the imports; by default, packages are imported using the name defined by the \nimported package, which by convention is of course the file name itself.\"\n\n(From the \"echo\" example, just below the explanation of const. This is to say nothing \nof Rob Pike saying essentially the same thing the techtalk where he introduced it.)\n\nSecond, it seems to compile just fine.\n\nThird, if it's a stylistic error, it seems like gofmt should fix it (although this I'm\nnot \ncertian about).\u003c/pre\u003e",
