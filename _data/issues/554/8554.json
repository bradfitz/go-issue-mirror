	"body": "by **machielg**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhen comparing two structs with non-nil function pointer, reflect.DeepEqual will return\nfalse. This is of course incorrect because the structs might be equal. In the ideal case\nit would actually compare the functions, but that's not feasible. \n\nReturning 'false' is impractical because DeepEqual will now always give me false for my\nstructs. It would be more practical to just ignore the functions in the comparison. That\nway DeepEqual will be informative (everything except functions were equal or not) and\nthe user can decide how to deal with function equality.\u003c/pre\u003e",
