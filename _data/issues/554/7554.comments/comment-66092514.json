Why is that happening? There aren't supposed to be nils in the\nwork buffer. In fact everything in the work buffer is supposed to be in the range\n[arena_start, arena_end). Are those set correctly? Add checks to the code that inserts\npointers into the work buffer to make sure nil is not being inserted. If it is, why? If\nit is not, why do we find a nil when we read back from the buffer? Is the memory being\nzeroed halfway through the collection somehow?\u003c/pre\u003e",
