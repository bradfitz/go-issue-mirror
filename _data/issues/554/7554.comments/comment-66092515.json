There is a number of places where we insert objects into workbuf w/o explicit\nchecks and assuming that it's not NULL. In particular enqueue1 function for roots, e.g.:\n\t\tenqueue1(\u0026wbuf, (Obj){p, s-\u003eelemsize, 0});\n\t\tenqueue1(\u0026wbuf, (Obj){(void*)\u0026spf-\u003efn, PtrSize, 0});\n\t\tenqueue1(\u0026wbuf, (Obj){(void*)\u0026spf-\u003efint, PtrSize, 0});\n\t\tenqueue1(\u0026wbuf, (Obj){(void*)\u0026spf-\u003eot, PtrSize, 0});\nI would add NULL checks into enqueue1/enqueue/flushobjbuf/flushptrbuf functions. If the\ncheck fires, then insert checks earlier, and so on.\u003c/pre\u003e",
