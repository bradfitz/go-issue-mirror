	"body": "I don't think there's any need for separate TPTR32 and TPTR64 types.  Within a single package compilation, pointers are always Widthptr wide.  Most of the code in the compiler either handles TPTR32 and TPTR64 identically, or only expects to see Tptr.\r\n\r\nThe only notable except appears to be in instruction selection, where there are cases like:\r\n\r\n        case OADDR_ | gc.TPTR32:\r\n                a = x86.ALEAL\r\n\r\n        case OADDR_ | gc.TPTR64:\r\n                a = x86.ALEAQ\r\n\r\nBut if we change the switch statement to use Simsimtype instead of Simtype, we can rewrite the cases to match on TUINT32/TUINT64 instead.",
