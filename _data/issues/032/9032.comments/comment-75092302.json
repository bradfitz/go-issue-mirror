Cloning over _git clone_ works well. The _b_ branch is checked out. Cloning over _go get_ fails with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  st% go get -v github.com/frederich/test2_9032\r\n  github.com/frederich/test2_9032 (download)\r\n  # cd /home/jf/src/github.com/frederich/test2_9032; git checkout master\r\n  error: pathspec 'master' did not match any file(s) known to git.\r\n  package github.com/frederich/test2_9032: exit status 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's okay, at the moment _go get_ assumes master is always present.\r\n\r\nI think we should find the right Git default branch if master is not present. But we should not use the  Github API to find the default Github branch.\r\n",
