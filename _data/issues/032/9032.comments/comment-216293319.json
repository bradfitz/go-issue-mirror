	"body": "One side effect of the fix removing `fixDetachedHead` is that it's no longer possible to use `go get -u -f` after having run `godep restore`.  It was really handy to be able to update dependencies (usually with `go get -d -u -f -v \u003cdeps\u003e`).\r\n\r\nIt doesn't look like the removal of `fixDetachedHead` was necessary for this fix â€“ @rsc was that just a cleanup you did because of the comment on that function saying \"Consider removing this for Go 1.3.\"?",
