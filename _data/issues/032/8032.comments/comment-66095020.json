Further, the TLS\nsegment is actually initialized by the time we get into the Go code.  However, since\nthere is no cgo, the program calls runtime·settls, passing it the address of\nruntime·tls0.  That loses all the non-Go TLS variables.  And since runtime.tlsgm is not\nat offset 0 in the TLS segment, that variable winds up referring to some other address. \nSo everything goes wrong.\n\nIf we simply skip the call to runtime·settls, everything works.\u003c/pre\u003e",
