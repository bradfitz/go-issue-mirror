	"body": "It looks like a bug, that `with` action in templates produce error with `missingkey=error`.\r\nDue the documentation `with` action is made for checking if pipeline is empty, and perfectly fits in logic, for example, if foo has key \"bar\", then print something. But with `missingkey=error` option it fails all template generation with error. (http://play.golang.org/p/kmmkkrHZYI)\r\n\r\nI found a workaround for this case, using `index` function. It works as expected, and does not produce errors on not existent key. But it makes templates less readable, and, I think, simple addressing should have same behaviour.\r\n\r\n",
