(I believe that's what this bug is about)\n\nb) behavior if more than 1 IP address?  Just pick a random one and assume they're all in\nthe same class?\n\nc) do we care about caching the DNS lookup so it's not done again by Transport's dialer\nin the non-proxied case, or do we trust the system resolver to cache?\u003c/pre\u003e",
