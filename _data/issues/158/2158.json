	"body": "by **Paul.A.Lalonde**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI live behind a gloriously huge firewall and proxy server.  All internal IP addresses,\non 10.0.0.0/8 should avoid the proxy server, as they don't get redirected inwards.\n\nNormally, adding '10.0.0.0/8' to my no_proxy environment variable handles this.\n\nReading \u0026quot;http/transport.go:/^func useProxy\u0026quot; it's evident that the code only\nhandles names or literal numeric matches.  Instead, the code should resolve the input\naddress and match against any numeric proxies (including subnet masking).  It should\nprobably also do a name lookup on any numeric input addresses and match them against\nstring names in no_proxy.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Proxy all your traffic  (set HTTP_PROXY to some proxy server)\n    - Try to connect to any local go web server using your *external* facing IP address (not localhost).  This should timeout/503.\n\n2. Make an exception for your local domain (set NO_PROXY to include 192.168.0.0/16, for\nexample, if you're behind a local router)\n    - Try to connect again.  This will still fail, instead of succeeding.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux Ubuntu 10.10\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?
