That data seems to be expansive and args and\nlocals data for instance is written down twice, two different ways. It would also be\npossible to avoid generating much of the detail for the runtime. It would also be\npossible to compress the DWARF information.\n\nWe should spend some time making the binaries smaller.\u003c/pre\u003e",
