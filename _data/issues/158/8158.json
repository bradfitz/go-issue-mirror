Grab the test code \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/ohDO8BsC2Z\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/ohDO8BsC2Z\u003c/a\u003e\n2. Run `go test -run One`, `go test -run Two`\n3. Run `go test`\n\nWhat happened?\n\n9 tries out of 10 gave me `panic during panic`, `fatal error: unexpected signal during\nruntime execution`. You may have to adjust sleep delay.\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nTest should have completed successfully (both tests marked as FAIL)\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI'm unable to reproduce this bug on go version go1.2.2 darwin/amd64.\u003c/pre\u003e",
