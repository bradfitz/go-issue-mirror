	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\ngo 1.7rc1\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n```\r\nOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOBIN=\"\"\r\nGOEXE=\"\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOPATH=\"/home/vince/dev\"\r\nGORACE=\"\"\r\nGOROOT=\"/home/vince/go\"\r\nGOTOOLDIR=\"/home/vince/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64\"\r\nCC=\"gcc\"\r\nGOGCCFLAGS=\"-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0 -fdebug-prefix-map=/tmp/go-build541667125=/tmp/go-build -gno-record-gcc-switches\"\r\nCXX=\"g++\"\r\nCGO_ENABLED=\"1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nPut a copy of golang.org/x/net/http2 at $GOPATH/src/vendor/golang.org/x/net/http2\r\n\r\nTry to build the following program using go build :\r\n\r\n```go\r\npackage vendoring17\r\n\r\nimport _ \"golang.org/x/net/http2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nEverything was working fine using go 1.6\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nWith go 1.7 I get :\r\n\r\npackage github.com/vanackere/bugs/vendoring17\r\n\timports golang.org/x/net/http2: use of vendored package not allowed\r\n\r\nThis bug appears at https://github.com/golang/go/commit/0104a31b8fbcbe52728a08867b26415d282c35d2 where golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack moves from internal to vendor\r\n\r\nFrom a first look it appears that (*Context) Import is confused by this change and assumes that vendor/golang.org/x/net/http2 is a package located in GOROOT. I don't have a proper fix for the moment (still looking into it) but I believe that this bug should be fixed for go 1.7.\r\n",
