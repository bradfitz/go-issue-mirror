Uncommenting any one of them (and removing the code just below the \ncomment) makes the code execute correctly.  As far as I can see the \ncommented code should do pretty much the same thing as the code causing the \nsegfault.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/745/0/bug.go\"\u003ebug.go\u003c/a\u003e (1833 bytes)",
