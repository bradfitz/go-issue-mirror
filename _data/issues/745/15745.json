	"body": "For example,\r\n```\r\ngo test -short -count=100 net\r\n--- FAIL: TestDialTimeoutMaxDuration (0.10s)\r\n\ttimeout_test.go:143: #1: Dial didn't return in an expected time\r\nFAIL\r\nFAIL\tnet\t211.917s\r\n```\r\nand we see sometimes it happens on buildbots. It just waits 100ms but probably a bit short for some case. Probably extending the deadline by 250ms, which is the maximum wait duration in TestReadTimeoutFluctuation and TestReadFromTimeoutFluctuation, makes sense.",
