	"body": "As far as I can tell, the value of `RTNLGRP_IPV4_IFADDR` is correct.  It is a netlink multicast group.  You can see it defined in linux/rtnetlink.h.  You can use it by setting the  `1 \u003c\u003c RTNLGRP_IPV4_IFADDR` bit in the `Groups` field of `syscall.SockaddrNetlink`.  Your code doesn't work because you are treating the value as a bitmask rather than as a bit number.\r\n\r\nYou are trying to use `RTMGRP_IPV4_IFADDR`, a different constant that the syscall package does not define.  That is the bitmask form of `RTNLGRP_IPV4_IFADDR`.  It is considered a legacy name.  New code should use the `RTNLGRP` constants instead, with shifts as needed.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is anything we should change in Go here.  I agree that this code is subtle, and that the names look very similar, but we are correctly defining the new API constants and I think it's reasonable for us to omit the old API.  If we decide that it's important to support the old API as well, we should do it in the x/sys/unix package, not the syscall package.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this but feel free to reopen if you disagree.",
