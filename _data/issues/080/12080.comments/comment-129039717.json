If you had removed the conversions, you would see the following type errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmain.go:10: cannot use x * x + y * y (type int) as type float64 in argument to math.Sqrt\r\nmain.go:11: cannot use f (type float64) as type int in assignment\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee http://play.golang.org/p/5MHPK6kMjx",
