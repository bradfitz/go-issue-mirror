We could create a whitelist of cacheable headers, but would\nthat negate the performance benefits of the memoization in the first place?\n\nRemoving the memoization makes the code almost 3x slower on direct cache hits (119 ns/op\nto 355 ns/op for the string \"accept-header\"). Worth it?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
