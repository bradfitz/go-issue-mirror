	"body": "There's a pretty common pattern in the code I'm working on where a `sync.RWMutex` is embedded into structs that need mutual  exclusion, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype foo struct {\r\n  sync.RWMutex\r\n\r\n  Foo string\r\n  Bar int\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen trying to encode structs like this I get an error with `gob: type sync.RWMutex has no exported fields`. It's simple enough to make the mutex into a named field, but handling this case automatically would be really nice.",
