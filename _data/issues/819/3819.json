Observe failure.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nab (apache bench) should print out a message stating that there was 1 Complete Request\nand 0 Failed requests.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nab prints out a message stating that there was 1 Complete request and 1 Failed request.\nAdditionally, there is an SSL error:\nBenchmarking localhost (be patient)...SSL read failed - closing connection\n140518402995936:error:140943E8:SSL\nroutines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:reason(1000):s3_pkt.c:1247:SSL alert number 0\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nStandard go run $file on amd64. I believe 6g is the default?\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nUbuntu 12.04 amd64.\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nVerified on both current go version and HEAD: go version weekly.2012-03-27 +10a3b26f9276\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI've attatched an export from wireshark below. This server works fine with curl. SSL\nnegotiation seems to happen perfectly, but there is some problem on teardown. I don't\nbelieve this is the same as the issue recently closed that affects 1/256 connections.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3819/0/bad_ssl_server.go\"\u003ebad_ssl_server.go\u003c/a\u003e (609 bytes)",
