From the docs:\n\nThe finalizer for x is scheduled to run at some arbitrary time after x becomes\nunreachable. There is no guarantee that finalizers will run before a program exits, so\ntypically they are useful only for releasing non-memory resources associated with an\nobject during a long-running program.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#SetFinalizer\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#SetFinalizer\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: removed **compilerbug**._\n\n_Owner changed to **---**._\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
