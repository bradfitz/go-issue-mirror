Even there is a general license released past year which lift some restrictions on exporting paid software and communication hardwares to Iran. ( http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/iran_gld1.pdf ) (Paragraph 6 is pretty interesting)\r\n\r\nAround same time (2013~2014) google allowed Iranian users to access google play but limitation still exist for google code and golang.\r\n\r\nI am almost sure there is no legal ground to enforce such restriction on accessing open source software from Iran and its company's choice to restrict access. Same codes freely accessible from github mirror repo.",
