ASN.1 based\nkeys are in crypto/x509 and are needed as part of the base libs. Other than that,\nthere's SSH and OpenPGP key formats and I can't really think of much else.\n\nThe SSH and OpenPGP code is both pretty well embedded in their respective packages and\npulling that code into a keyformats package doesn't appeal.\n\nSo I think that, if parsePubKey is needed, the least bad option is for ssh to export it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
