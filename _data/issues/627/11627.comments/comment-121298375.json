	"body": "Thanks for reporting this; I can reproduce it easily on Linux.\r\n\r\nThe problem is very simple but not simple to fix: go/loader only performs cgo preprocessing on imported packages, not ad hoc packages such as the one consisting of [\"p.go\"].  The workarounds is to move the cgo code into a separate package and import it.  The fix is to rethink go/loader, which I will do after go1.5.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNotes to self: we need to copy and adapt the logic of goFilesPackage (from $GOROOT/src/cmd/go/build.go).  Once this is done, all the loader.Config methods (Import and Create) will return the same kind of entity, essentially a build.Package.  Perhaps we can even reuse this type directly.\r\n\r\nAlso: we should support swig.",
