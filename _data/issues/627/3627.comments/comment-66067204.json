Rationale:\n\nWhile it wouldn't be too hard to fix this, it is not clear that it is the right thing to\ndo: In general, gofmt respects extra newlines (up to a max. of one at this point), so\nremoving it here would mean changing that rule. We have code in the library of the form:\n\nif some_condition {\n\n      alot-of-code-here\n\n} else {\n\n      alot-of-code-here\n\n}\n\nwhere the extra empty lines around the inner code blocks are intentional to make the\noverall structure more visible. Doing a good formatting job here would mean to either a)\nrecognize this case and not eliminate the empty lines, or b) recognize this case and\neliminate the empty lines before and after (context-sensitive). This kind of\nlarger-scale context sensitive formatting is non-trivial in the current implementation\nof gofmt and generally not done.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
