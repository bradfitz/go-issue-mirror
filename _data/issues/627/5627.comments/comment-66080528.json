This is intentional, so that stack traces are\nuseful. I've wasted far too much time debugging missing frames in C and C++ programs.\nThe tail call optimization applied implicitly by the special case wrappers is okay\nbecause those are not real functions anyway.\n\nI agree about the ARM immediates; let's make that a separate issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
