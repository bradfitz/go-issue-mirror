The step that timesout on the builder takes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n##### GOMAXPROCS=2 runtime -cpu=1,2,4\r\nok      runtime 53.032s\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor reference, on my machine, the `##### Testing packages` section takes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreal    0m28.597s\r\nuser    1m42.035s\r\nsys     0m19.820s\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompared to the value reported on the builder of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreal\t1m56.056s\r\nuser\t2m5.293s\r\nsys\t0m23.400s\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo a legitimate test run crossing the 10 minute window, based on 53s from my machine, seems unlikely.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how to fix this, as I can't reproduce the test timeout locally.\r\n\r\nEven if the builder is running an older FreeBSD, @adg said 9.1 in another thread, I wouldn't expect things to break this bad with this change.  Prior to #6372 only one build in a couple dozens would have a errant syscall.\r\n\r\nIs there any easy way to revert this, or do I just send another CL?  Any suggestions on how to test/debug this?",
