	"body": "Yah. I don't know why Apple is returning errors in GOAWAY frames. I just ran the test again to confirm that it is still the case.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with the HTTP/2 specification. Should I open an issue with Apple as to why they are returning errors in GOAWAY or is that a legit thing to do? Some way of accessing the GOAWAY debug message from Go could be useful, but do note that there are GOAWAY frames with no debug message after the ones with one.\r\n\r\nAlternatively I could just handle EOF and document that people should use `GODEBUG=http2debug=2` for further detail.",
