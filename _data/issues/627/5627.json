	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eAn embedded trampoline is a function that exists to marshal a receiver of type *S to a\nreceiver of type *T when T is an embedded field in S.\n\nAn embedded trampoline can be implemeted as a very small function that simply adjusts\nthe pointer of the receiver and tail calls the desired method.\n\nThe 6g and 8g compilers do just that but the 5g compiler does not.  Instead, it\ngenerates an wrapper function which solves the more general problem of converting a\nreceiver of type S to a receiver of type T.\n\nThere is actually code in 5g to generate an embedded trampoline but it is presently\ncommented out.  This code should be revived.  \n\nAlternatively, additional analysis could be done on wrapper functions to generate code\nthat has the efficiency of an embedded trampoline.\u003c/pre\u003e",
