Currently the race detector\ninstrumentation fails within a signal handler, such as trying to call copy() in\ncpuprof.go.  The cause seems to be similar to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/137910043\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/137910043\u003c/a\u003e\nwhere racectx for gsignal needs to be initialized too, but as mentioned in the cpuprof\ncode review, that change alone didn't seem sufficient to fix the problem.\u003c/pre\u003e",
