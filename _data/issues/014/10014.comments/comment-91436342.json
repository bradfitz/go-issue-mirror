	"body": "It seems fine to me for the spec not to guarantee anything about struct field order in memory. The spec doesn't operate at that level.\n\nThat said, no Go compiler should probably ever reorder struct fields. That seems like it is trying to solve a 1970s problem, namely packing structs to use as little space as possible. The 2010s problem is to put related fields near each other to reduce cache misses, and (unlike the 1970s problem) there is no obvious way for the compiler to pick an optimal solution. A compiler that takes that control away from the programmer is going to be that much less useful, and people will find better compilers.",
