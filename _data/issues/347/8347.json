	"body": "by **Chance.Zibolski**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eFirstly, I want to mention this issue was found in go 1.2.2 and resolved in go 1.3, but\nbecause I was unable to find a bug, or any mention of this problem in the release notes,\nI was not very confident that the Go authors were aware of the bug existing or getting\nfixed, because the lack of disclosure related to the issue.\n\nThe issue violates the spec \u0026quot;The value of ok is true if the value received was\ndelivered by a successful send operation to the channel, or false if it is a zero value\ngenerated because the channel is closed and empty.\u0026quot;\n\nThe actual behavior in go 1.2.2 is that the value is false when the channel is closed\n*OR* empty.\n\nBecause there may be code running on 1.2.2 which expects the behavior to be the\n\u0026quot;OR\u0026quot; (even though it isnt according the spec), I would have expected this to\nbe announced on the release, much like how map iteration became random.\n\nI also expect that there would be a test to verify, and assert the proper behavior, but\nI'm also unsure of that.\n\nWhat does 'go version' print?\n\ngo1.2.2 linux/amd64\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\n\nUse the val, ok idiom to receive from a non-closed channel which is empty, inside of a\nselect structure with a default case.\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/zvPKOQeOD5\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/zvPKOQeOD5\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/ecnahc515/9c42754b8c4dfc27500f\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/ecnahc515/9c42754b8c4dfc27500f\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe value of okay was set to false.\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\nThe value of okay should remain true.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nAfter talking to some people in #go-nuts who bisected, they seem to think the issue was\nfixed here: \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/83000048\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/83000048\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
