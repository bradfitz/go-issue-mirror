This means that any paths that are compared after being run through\nfilepath.Clean() will match.  The attached patch maps it to lower case, and also tweaks\nsome tests that assumed it was upper case (going the other way just breaks a different\nset of tests).\n\nI think this problem is also the cause of issues 3370 and 3377.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3347/2/issues_3347_3370_3377_patch.txt\"\u003eissues_3347_3370_3377_patch.txt\u003c/a\u003e (3325 bytes)",
