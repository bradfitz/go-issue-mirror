What's going on is this:\r\n\r\nb1 -\u003e b2\r\nb2 -\u003e b3\r\nb3 -\u003e b2\r\n\r\nAll of which are on the dead side of a constant branch.  b2 uses a value x from b1.  When we detect that b1 is dead during machine-independent optimization, we mark b1 as dead and remove all its values, including x.  But b2 \u0026 b3 form a loop, so they are not removed during this phase (they will be during deadcode, but that is a separate pass).  So the user of x is still around, and check complains that it has a missing arg.",
