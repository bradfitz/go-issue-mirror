	"body": "by **kirklin.mcdonald**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eThe attached patch adds support for four new variables to Make.pkg.\n\nSpecifying the BIN variable in a Makefile that includes Make.pkg will cause \nthe resulting package to be linked into a binary, with the name given by \n$BIN.\n\nGOFLAGS allows the user to specify additional flags to pass to the \ncompiler. In particular, this includes additional -I flags.\n\nGLFLAGS allows the user to specify additional flags to the linker. This is \na counterpart to the BIN variable, given that the $BIN rule is the only one \nwhich invokes $(LD). This is particularly useful for specifying a -L flag.\n\nPREFIX permits the user to specify an alternative to GOROOT for the \npurposes of installing a package. (It more or less just GOROOT_QUOTED \nrenamed.) (A separate variable from GOROOT is required for this purpose, as \nGOROOT is what permits the user's Makefile to find Make.pkg in the first \nplace.)\n\nThe latter three varaibles, taken together, permit the user to create a \ndirectory for third-party libraries, separate from the standard library. \nSetting GOFLAGS and GLFLAGS in .bashrc allows future builds to see this \nthird-party directory. Setting PREFIX at 'make install'-time installs \npackages into this directory.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/347/0/Make.pkg.diff\"\u003eMake.pkg.diff\u003c/a\u003e (1994 bytes)",
