Those architectures are memory constrained, and there's not much we can do about that.\r\n\r\nWe've got lots of other open bugs about the compiler's memory use (a sampling: #15350 and #14775), and progress there will help this issue.\r\n\r\nThere are available workarounds, including cross-compiling from a 64-bit machine and splitting large function bodies up.\r\n",
