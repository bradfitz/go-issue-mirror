I compiled hello world and I am good to go.\n\nYour instructions were correct. I reread the Go \"Getting Started\" guide and I added the\nenvironment variables in my .basrc file. Previously, my $GOROOT path would just take me\nto the home user folder. Whenever I did a cd $GOROOT, I would just \nget to cd ~\n\nThese were the lines I added to my .bashrc file:\n\n#Added lines below for GO Programming language\n#06/12/2011\n\nexport GOROOT=$HOME/gotest/go\nexport GOARCH=amd64\nexport GOOS=linux\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/dnukem/gotest/go/bin\n\n\nIt was just weird that if my $GOROOT environment variable was incorrect, why did\neverything work up until the \"test net\" portion of the installation? I figured it would\nhave given me a nasty message early on about my settings.\n\nThanks for the help. I will always be a noob.\n\n-OlympusRunner\u003c/pre\u003e",
