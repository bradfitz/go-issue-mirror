I'd hope we can do better here.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that with \"reasonable\" flow control, reasonable often isn't known and implementations of interfaces can be selected at runtime with totally different properties. Camlistore uses a package to do a VFS where different paths are mounted with different file implementations (like google3 files). What's reasonable for /memfile/foo is very different from what's reasonable from /mnt/my-ext3-filesystem/.\r\n",
