On my darwin\nmachine the code compiles correctly (386/amd64). When I use a cross compiler, then I've\ngotten the code to compile for linux (386/amd64/arm). For all the *bsds the\ncross-compiler choked on the PROT_READ and MAP_PRIVATE symbols, and nothing else (not\nthe Mmap call itself). I also installed freebsd 9.1 64-bit on a virtual machine to check\nmore directly, and failed identically to the cross-compiler:\n./mmap.go:23: undefined: syscall.PROT_READ\n./mmap.go:23: undefined: syscall.MAP_PRIVATE\n\nThese results are backed up by my cursory look into the zerrors_*.go files.\n\n2) On my VM I tried to rebuild the z*.go files using the mkall.sh script. Even without\nchanging any files at all I get out z*.go files which are different than the ones\nchecked into the repository, and more importantly, syscall then fails to build. The most\nlikely reason is because my freebsd version (9.1) has C headers significantly enough\ndifferent to cause the resulting files to be broken. This is not terribly relevant to\nthe issue, except that I was trying to solve the issue myself (and post a CL), but this\ndevelopment suggests that any solution I come up with may break other people's code in\nunexpected ways, and I don't feel my *bsd skills are up to the task.\u003c/pre\u003e",
