But when people see JSON-RPC 1.0 support in standard library, and \"codecs\" support in net/rpc they start looking for 2.0 support for net/rpcâ€¦ and don't find any. So I think it's worth mentioning in this issue.\r\n\r\nI decided to implement it as a codec instead of separate rpc-package mostly as educational task - to learn how net/rpc implemented, check is interfaces mentioned in [JSON-RPC: a tale of interfaces](https://blog.golang.org/json-rpc-tale-of-interfaces) are flexible enough, and to avoid implementing both protocol and RPC engine in my first project.",
