	"body": "In type.go, we have a bunch of helper methods like IsInteger, IsSigned, IsPtrShaped, etc. that currently can only be used on specific types (i.e., `*Type`), but many of these are really properties of type kinds (`EType`).  This is annoying in parts of the compiler where we don't care about type identity anymore, but would still care about properties like signedness/etc.\r\n\r\nI think we should change Type's `Etype EType` field into an embedding of EType and change these method's receiver parameters from `*Type` to `EType`.\r\n\r\nSome need to stay on `*Type` though; notably IsEmptyInterface and IsUntyped, because they depend on properties of the specific type.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit redundant for the single-kind methods like IsMap to be moved to EType, but for consistency we might as well move them too.\r\n\r\nFiling as an issue in case anyone objects or has alternative proposals.",
