As a consequence it cannot show substituted values as \nsuggested (in general, an exported constant value may be imported from some other \npackage). On the other hand it can show the \"interface\" of a package before a \npackage can be compiled (for instance because packages it depends on are not yet \ncompiled).\n\nThis works as intended.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
