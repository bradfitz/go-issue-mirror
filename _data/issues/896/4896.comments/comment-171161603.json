For now that's exactly what am doing.\r\n\r\nHowever, notice the number of steps that it takes:\r\n+ ioutil.TempFile(entryDir, prefix).\r\n+ defer tempFile.Close().\r\n+ defer os.RemoveAll(path.Join(entryDir, tempFile.Name()))\r\n+ and all the error checking. \r\n\r\nos.Rename suffers from a few problems if the /tmp dir is not on the same device\r\nunless we do byte by byte copying, please see https://github.com/rakyll/statik/pull/5.\r\nIt also isn't atomic.\r\n\r\nNow let's compare that to using tempfile.New, and tempfile.DeferDelete and that's simpler.\r\nI am all for us keeping things as they were if it keeps the code and language simpler and if the implementation is tricky, then I can implement some package or ways around it.",
