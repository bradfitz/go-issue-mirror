(You can extract the individual .a files by running gomobile with the -work.)\r\n\r\nFor ARMv7 it looks like we are not compiling as PIC for iOS, which is easy to fix. For ARMv8 I was under the impression the compiler was generating PC-relative code by default, but I tried to confirm with a quick inspection of the compiler and it's not clear to me.",
