	"body": "Right now at process start up time on a Unix system all signals are caught, except that if SIGHUP and SIGINT are ignored, they remain ignored.  If the program uses the os/signal.Notify to request notification of a signal, and then calls Stop, the signal will no longer be caught--it will revert to the default behaviour.\r\n\r\nThere are three states for a signal: caught, default, ignored.  Right now we always start at caught, except for SIGHUP/SIGINT, and then os/signal can change to default.  We should be more consistent about signal states.  Or at least document it better.",
