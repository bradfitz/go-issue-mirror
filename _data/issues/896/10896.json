	"body": "The callback terminology feels odd in Go code. We should rather call them Handlers. I have surveyed godoc to see how community feels and saw only a few instances of the use of callback term. The standard library and the community emerges in the use of handlers. If we keep the callback terminology around, it might give a false impression that they are of another kind of handlers. Let's clean the mobile repo from callbacks and call them handlers.\r\n\r\n/cc @crawshaw @hyangah @minux ",
