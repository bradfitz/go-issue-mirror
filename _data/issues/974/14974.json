	"body": "Linux supports attaching packet filters to sockets. This turns out to be very important for IPConns of popular protocols like TCP or UDP, otherwise the kernel will helpfully give you ~all traffic the machine is involved in through a small kernel-userspace straw.\r\n\r\nThe API is to call setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER) with a BPF program struct. The struct is already defined by x/sys/unix, but needs an appropriate Setsockopt wrapper that accepts that struct. Then, x/net/ipv4's PacketConn and RawConn should get methods plumbed through, so that you can use net and x/net/ipv4 types exclusively to set packet filters, without having to touch raw FDs and syscalls directly.\r\n\r\nI have most of the code for this already in a different repository, which I'm going to put together into a code review - filing this for tracking, and of course to ask if this sounds like a reasonable addition.",
