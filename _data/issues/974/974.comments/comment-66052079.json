I'm not sure how acceptable this is, because it breaks the exported\napi.\n\nAttached is a patch file with the changes.\n\nThe URL.String() method has also been rewritten to use a bytes.Buffer to build the url\ninstead of performing a lot of \"abc\" + \"def\". It should speed things up a little.\n\nI'd like some input on whether the patch is acceptable before I submit it for review.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/974/2/issue974.patch\"\u003eissue974.patch\u003c/a\u003e (3392 bytes)",
