	"body": "I'm not keen on exposing SetsockBlahBlah API because it makes people who have no interest in networking stuff confuse and complain. At present, x/sys/unix package has no capability to work together with runtime-integrated network poller and it doesn't appear to come up soon. That's the reason why x/net/{icmp,ipv4,ipv6} packages never use x/sys/unix  and I dropped BPF/netlink/routing socket APIs from x/sys/unix package.\r\n\r\nA few random thoughts on your plan:\r\n- Adding new APIs for injecting BPF/eBPF programs into x/net/{ipv4,ipv6} packages sounds fine\r\n- Can we have a new package that provides eBPF/BPF program marshaler?\r\n - At first it simply provides platform-agnostic BPF/eBPF op. code/data marshaling\r\n - We will be able to add platform-independent link-layer snoop and filter APIs later\r\n- It would be a help not only for x/net/{ipv4,ipv6} but for making ARP/LLDP/etc packages using AF_PACKET socket or BPF/eBPF file\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
