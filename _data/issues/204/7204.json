	"title": "runtime type assertion provides incorrect error message",
	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhen a type has the required method, but it's fingerprint is different from what is\nrequired by interface, then asserting the interface type against it throws an error that\nis much weaker than what you can get at compile time. More than that - the message is\ntechnically incorrect.\n\nExample:\ntype Ticker interface {Tick() bool}\ntype A struct {}\nfunc (a A) Tick() {}\n\n(type A does not implement Ticker - mismatch of return value)\n\n1) If you try to assert it at compile time - you get a very good error message:\n\nvar b Ticker = A{}\n\nA does not implement Ticker (wrong type for Tick method)\nhave: ...\nwant: ...\n\n2) But if you do the same at the run time, the error message is weaker:\n\nvar i interface{} = A{}\ni.(Ticker).Tick()\n\npanic: interface conversion: main.A is not main.Ticker: missing method Tick\n\nThat is wrong - method is not missing, it is indeed of the wrong type.\n\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nDemo of compile-time error: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/cyZ1T7x-4L\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/cyZ1T7x-4L\u003c/a\u003e\nDemo of runtime error: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/QodZPLPR_I\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/QodZPLPR_I\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output? runtime error should be as good as compile error.\n\nWhat do you see instead? \u0026quot;Missing method\u0026quot; while it is not really missing.\n\nWhich compiler are you using? Whatever play.golang.org uses. On my laptop I just use\n\u0026quot;go build file.go\u0026quot;\n\nWhich operating system are you using? Goobuntu 12.04\n\nWhich version are you using?  go version go1.2 linux/amd64\u003c/pre\u003e",
