I guess though you would use a context with a timeout or the like to protect against that in the handler?\r\n\r\nYes, that's the job of the handler or caller of http.Transport.RoundTrip to guard against. We only give a timeout for headers, since the user isn't in control there.\r\n\r\n\u003e Should ReadTimeout be canceled after the request's Body is closed, not when the headers are finished being read?\r\n\r\nSetReadDeadline is currently only called before a TLS handshake, and before reading request headers, and is never disabled.\r\n\r\nSo yes, to work similarly to Go 1.0-1.7, we should probably not reset it after the headers and have it apply to the whole request, even if that's slightly odd.\r\n",
