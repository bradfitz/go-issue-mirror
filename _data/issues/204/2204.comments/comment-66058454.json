Or maybe it could be cheap too, but\n\n    b := []byte(s)\n    for i, _ := range b {\n        b[i] = 1\n    }\n\nwould be expensive.  You comment out a line and boom,\nexpense happens.\n\nI don't see a way around this, and we are probably going\nto get forced to make optimizations like this.\n(Escape analysis is one.)\n\nBut I am still a bit uncomfortable.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @rsc._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
