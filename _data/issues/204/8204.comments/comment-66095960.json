Since that doesn't convey any useful\nnumeric type, the numeric type chosen is int.  That int value is then converted to\ninterface{}.  Then the rules for comparing interfaces apply.\n\nYour suggestion appears to be that the dynamic type of the interface should be used to\ndetermine the type of the constant.  In the general case that is either impossible or\nvery expensive.  It's not how Go works.\u003c/pre\u003e",
