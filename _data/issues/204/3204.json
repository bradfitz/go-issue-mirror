I'm using the\nfollowing code to patch through std in/out:\n\u003ca href=\"https://bitbucket.org/kardianos/vcsguard/src/2eb2be8b45d0/cmd.go\"\u003ehttps://bitbucket.org/kardianos/vcsguard/src/2eb2be8b45d0/cmd.go\u003c/a\u003e\nI've also tested it with the std error streaming disabled, so the stdout stderr lines\nshouldn't be an issue here.\n\nWhen I make normal changes to a repo and push/pull, this works well.  However, when I\ntry to pull or push a larger repo from scratch, we either fail or freeze.  I don't\nentirely understand the locking at this point, but it feels like it might be an\ninteraction between the wait condition and the serverLock (?).\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nI'm on 6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nlinux\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nI'm at tip on both go and go.crypto as of March 5th. \n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
