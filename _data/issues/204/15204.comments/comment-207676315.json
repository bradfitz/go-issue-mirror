	"body": "It looks like right now we crash with a stack trace for SIGSYS on Darwin, DragonFly, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris.  We do not crash on FreeBSD and GNU/Linux.  As far as I can tell, the different behaviour on GNU/Linux was accidentally introduced in https://golang.org/cl/3749041 .\r\n\r\nI think we should undo that change, and make SIGSYS crash with a stack trace on all platforms.  The net package does not depend on any particular SIGSYS behaviour.  It depends on an invalid system call returning ENOSYS, which it will regardless of how SIGSYS is handled.  There are very few cases in which the Linux kernel will send a SIGSYS signal.",
