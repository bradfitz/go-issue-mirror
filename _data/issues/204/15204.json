What did you do?**\r\nI sent a SIGSYS signal to a Go program.\r\n\r\nProgram: https://gist.github.com/flowerhack/b0a46e5fabeb3d9c214e14543e67fe50\r\n\r\n(Unfortunately, I can't include a play.golang.org link, since the playground doesn't seem to recognize some important parts of the syscall package, e.g. syscall.SIGSYS.)\r\n\r\n**4. What did you expect to see?**\r\n\r\nI expected to see the program exit with a stack dump.  (Documentation that states this should occur: https://golang.org/pkg/os/signal/).\r\n\r\n**5. What did you see instead?**\r\n\r\nThe program continued to run.\r\n\r\n(I have a patch for this issue that I'll be submitting shortly~)",
