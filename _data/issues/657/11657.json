	"body": "Discussed with @alandonovan yesterday, recording here.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to have a refactoring tool that could convert between:\r\n\r\n`func (t T) f(x int)`\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n`func f(t T, x int)`\r\n\r\n and clean up all the callers. This could be do with `eg`, but for common refactorings, it might be nicer to have a tool that can just do it, without having to write a template (or write a template generator), so that it can be invoked easily by IDEs. This probably just means new frontends to eg.",
