I can work something up if you want but the last time I did this for\nan issue, everyone complained that my simplified example was too simplistic.\n\nI know about \"n != 0\" and I should have addressed that in the proposal. The simple\nanswer is that when you are converting a type to a different type it should be very\nclear that you are doing that. In my opinion \"bool(n)\" makes it very clear. Recognizing\n\"n != 0\" is idiomatic. The fact the it's one less character is largely irrelevant.\u003c/pre\u003e",
