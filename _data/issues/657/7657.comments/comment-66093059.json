Math has no (well defined) mapping\nbetween booleans and numbers - that's why it's a mess in some languages.\n\nCode, on the other side, can produce different numbers conditionally, where the\ncondition is a boolean.\n\nIOW, it should look like code, not like a conversion which it isn't.\u003c/pre\u003e",
