If you are presenting something different to xcode, it may need a different process. You can run the gomobile tool with -x flag to see what commands are being run.\r\n\r\nTo start the debugging process: do the basic examples or Ivy from the mobile subrepository work on your xcode installation? If so, there is some interaction between your build process, xcode, and the go binary that is the problem. If not, please report what you're seeing with the examples, which should work on armv7.",
