Operators are defined on those \"qualities\", for instance, in the\n\"Arithmetic operators\" section:\n\n\"Arithmetic operators apply to numeric values...\"\n\nThus, I think technically we already say everything. That said,  glyn.normington's\nsuggestion is a good one and I have added a respective sentence to the \"Types\" intro.\nSee: \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/100130044\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/100130044\u003c/a\u003e .\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Started**._",
