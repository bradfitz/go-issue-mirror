Error does not occur when there is single named bool returned.\r\n\r\nAlso, this combinations will work:\r\n* ``return 0 \u003c= 1 \u0026\u0026 ii \u003c= 0x7fffffff, ii``\r\n* ``return 0 \u003c= ii \u0026\u0026 1 \u003c= 0x7fffffff, ii``\r\n* ``return 0 \u003c= 1 \u0026\u0026 0 \u003c= 0x7fffffff, ii``\r\n\r\nSo probably as @0xmohit mentioned it's a side effect of optimization introduced in https://github.com/golang/go/commit/62861889863d3d61f546d01aa7bd9824df1b33df",
