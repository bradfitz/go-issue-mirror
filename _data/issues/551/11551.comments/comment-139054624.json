You can\nimagine that we  implement filepath.Join in a way you described\n(chdir into each element, and then return the current directory),\nbut that's not how filepath.Join currently works.\n\nI wouldn't call existing code as buggy. People might look at our\ntest cases and assume that filepath.Join(\"C:\", \"Windows\")\nreturning \"C:\\Windows\" is the expected behavior of filepath.Join\nand then rely on that. If we don't have such a test case, then\nperhaps we can argue that it's unintended behavior. But with\nthat test case, I don't think we can call the behavior buggy as\nwe basically told people it's the intention.\n",
