	"body": "Thanks to everyone for their input. It seems to me I don't have support for my change. I just want to clarify my reasoning (before I abandon my change). With this code:\r\n```\r\na := ...\r\nb := filepath.Join(a, ...)\r\n```\r\nIf \"a\" contains absolute path (filepath.IsAbd(a) returns true), should I expect \"b\" to contain absolute path?\r\n\r\nIf \"a\" contains relative path (filepath.IsAbd(a) returns false), should I expect \"b\" to contain relative path?\r\n\r\nThe answers to these questions are \"yes\" on unix. Not so on windows. This program http://play.golang.org/p/_DOiToc8cD prints:\r\n```\r\n\r\na is \"c:\\\\\" and filepath.IsAbs(a) is true\r\nb is \"c:\\\\file.txt\" and filepath.IsAbs(b) is true\r\n\r\na is \"c:\" and filepath.IsAbs(a) is false\r\nb is \"c:\\\\file.txt\" and filepath.IsAbs(b) is true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that this invariant is important. If only because Go team developers (none of who use windows) assume that invariant is there. So no amount of documenting will stop them (and others) from making mistakes.\r\n\r\nAlex",
