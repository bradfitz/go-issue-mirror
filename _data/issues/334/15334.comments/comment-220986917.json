Missing 'getlastmodified' for folders prevents clients to sort all files and folders correctly, since they all have the same mtime, which is Unix epoch.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nNot a concrete clue but just for the sake of reference: \r\n\r\nnginx webdav module: https://github.com/arut/nginx-dav-ext-module/blob/master/ngx_http_dav_ext_module.c#L374\r\n\r\napache webdav module: https://github.com/apache/httpd/blob/8322599c746bbdf1410a098a5d4764499baf7670/modules/dav/fs/repos.c#L1959",
