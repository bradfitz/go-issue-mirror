	"body": "What should happen if more IPs are added to a hostname? Should\nthe net package automatically listen on those newly added addrs?\n\nNo matter what we do, I think the behavior will surprise some users.\n\nAlso, what do you think should the Listener's Addr() method return\nfor a listener that listens on multiple addresses? Return the hostname\nis not entirely correct. Because when the Addr() is called, hostname\nmight resolve to a different set of addresses. Also note that Addr\nrepresents a network end point address, i don't think a hostname\nfits here.\n\nIMHO, the existing documentation actually precludes listening on\nmultiples addresses by a single listener.\n\nI always think supporting hostname in Listen is just a convenience,\nand if you want absolute control, you should use explicit address.",
