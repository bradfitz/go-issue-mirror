	"body": "gccgo declares the RawSockaddr.Data field as []int8. On s390/s390x, this field should be a []uint8, since the corresponding C field is a char array, and the char type is unsigned by default. This issue is preventing some code from building correctly with both go and gccgo, as previously described in issue #11469.\r\n\r\nThe same problem also affects RawSockaddrUnix which has a Path field defined as []int8.",
