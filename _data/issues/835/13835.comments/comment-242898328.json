	"body": "The parser and encoder of net/mail.Address doesn't handle Punycode either. I've found it as a surprise(perhaps should be documented) because Address.Name is word-encoded/decoded.\r\n The latest email [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6532#section-3.2) obsoletes both Punycode and word-encoding so I would say that the trend is to support native UTF-8. How it's displayed to the end user may be a different story.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** net/mail doesn't need additional documentation. After more research I've found that\r\n\"IDNA does not update the existing email standards, which allow only ASCII characters in local parts\". Therefore a domain label that holds the local part of an email address should not be encoded/decoded. Sorry for the noise.",
