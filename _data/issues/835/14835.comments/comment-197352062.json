I think it should be as simple as using ulimit to set the number of process to something small and then running go code with loads of goroutines but I'm having trouble making it occur.\r\n\r\n**If** I understand correctly (which is a big if -- this is my first time looking at this code) the sched code seems to spawn native threads to run goroutines on? If so, it seems like it would make sense to read the max process count from the OS and not spawn more than XX% of that? I don't really understand under what conditions it decide it needs more native threads?\r\n\r\nThe other option, which feels a lot harder, is to make an unsuccessful pthread_create call not a hard failure (and dealing with the consequences)?",
