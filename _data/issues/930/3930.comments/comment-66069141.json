The issue with crypto is that there's more scope for subtle mistakes\nto be a real problem.\n\nI've received one (non-security) bug from someone competent who reviewed the code, but\nit certainly hasn't undergone the kind of review that OpenSSL has. (That makes it the\nsame as the vast majority of crypto code: GnuTLS, GnuPG etc.)\n\nOn the other hand, the security advisories for OpenSSL are fairly numerous\n\u003ca href=\"http://openssl.org/news/\"\u003ehttp://openssl.org/news/\u003c/a\u003e and there are more in the pipeline.\u003c/pre\u003e",
