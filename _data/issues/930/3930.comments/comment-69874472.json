If you've used the above patch and recompiled, and you want to make sure your `go` binary is patched, you can run\r\n\r\n    grep 'tls: unsupported SSLv2 handshake received' `which go`\r\n\r\nto see if this SSLv2 error from the standard library, which should NOT be in your patched `go`, is present nonetheless.  And if you run `go build myprogram.go`, afterward you can run `grep 'tls: unsupported SSLv2 handshake received' myprogram` to make sure that the Go runtime that has been linked into your `myprogram` binary is the patched one.",
