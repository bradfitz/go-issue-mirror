I looked around on the internet and found what appears to be [Oracle's official advice on SSL settings as of January 2015](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/cve-2014-3566-2342133.html).\r\n\r\nUnder the text \"For the following use cases Oracle recommends\", it says that _client-side_ uses should set the protocols to exclude the SSLv2 hello, for example:\r\n\r\n    sslSocket.setEnabledProtocols(new String[] {\"TLSv1\"});\r\n    sslEngine.setEnabledProtocols(new String[] {\"TLSv1\"});\r\n\r\nSo the Java clients that are still sending SSLv2Hello are not following Oracle's advice.\r\n\r\nBased on @agl's Go server-side advice and Oracle's Java client-side advice, I think it is reasonable for Go not to support SSLv2 compatibility handshakes for Java clients.\r\n\r\n@iragsdale, @ErwanLegrand, @elimisteve, sorry for the false alarm; no CLA needed after all.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone.",
