And in many cases it's not going to be feasible to modify the Java properties of the connecting applications to only do TLS.\r\n\r\nSix months ago I would have had more sympathy for \"Go's SSL implementation is not production-ready.\"  These days I'm pretty sure OpenSSL's SSL implementation isn't production-ready either.",
