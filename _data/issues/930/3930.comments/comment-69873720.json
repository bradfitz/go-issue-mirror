	"body": "I've tweaked `erwan.legrand`'s Go 1.1 patch to support Go 1.4.  I applied it to my std lib, and the dreaded failed requests and `tls: unsupported SSLv2 handshake received` error messages appear to be gone!  (See below.)\r\n\r\nHaving a 95% solution in Go was painful, and after trying many other options (e.g., re-implementing much of my proxy app in another language with a more mature TLS library, using a not-programmable-enough Python proxy, and almost starting from scratch and using Nginx + Lua), this finally appears to be a fully working solution -- and 100% in Go!\r\n\r\nTo reiterate previous security warnings:\r\n\r\n\u003e Before you use this, please read Adam Langley's comments above: the Go TLS stack is not ready for production. For all we know, it might leak your private key. You have been\r\nwarned.\r\n\r\nTo download and use this patch, then recompile the Go standard library on Linux, run something like...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd ~\r\nwget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/elimisteve/e3fea232c11fa08146d6/raw/e2457232b63a8f0433326874621565475cdb2524/Allow-SSLv2-ClientHello-go1.4.patch\r\ncd go/src  # cd to wherever your Go source is located\r\npatch -p0 \u003c ~/Allow-SSLv2-ClientHello-go1.4.patch\r\n./all.bash  # recompile\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you, all!",
