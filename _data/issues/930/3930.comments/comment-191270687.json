The one in the Gist has only trivial changes from the original by Ian Ragsdale, so I think the only CLA we absolutely need is his. \r\n\r\n@iragsdale, could you complete a contributor CLA (https://golang.org/doc/contribute#copyright) so that we can put the SSLv2 compatibility code into Go's standard crypto/tls?\r\n\r\nIf @ErwanLegrand and @elimisteve want to complete CLAs as well I'm happy to credit them too, but the followup changes appear to have been quite minor.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone.",
