IE on XP was a big source of this and we've made that mostly moot by disabling SSLv3 by default on trunk. You can also get the same thing with s_client if you don't update OpenSSL, which is similarly a bad idea.\r\n\r\nSince this deprecation is so old (1996) that it can vote now, I think it's ok that it's a little bit of work to support it.",
