	"body": "After an HTTP server parses a request's headers, it essentially passes control of the protocol handling to a request body Reader.  Generally, this Reader either consumes up to the number bytes specified by Content-Length, or follows a chunked encoded entity.\r\n\r\nBut, errors encountered at this stage are completely ignored by the server. Broken connections are left in tact, and the server will attempt to read further requests from them. \r\n\r\nThis is a vector for request smuggling.",
