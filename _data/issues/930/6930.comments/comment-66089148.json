The attached code uses a wildcard address on both passive and active TCP\nendpoint holders. Please replace them with some specific address such as 127.0.0.1 and\nsee what happens. Probably it would be a workaround.\n\nA dumb hypothesis: Mavericks implements some fancy networking feature that tries to find\nout the best IP transport layer path on the fly working together with IP routing.\nConventionally a packet to the wildcard address 0.0.0.0 is routed to the localhost, and\nit might be some cost on Mavericks.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
