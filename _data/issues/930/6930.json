	"body": "by **derek.collison**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eI came across a sever performance regression on MacOSX Mavericks. This problem does not\nexist on Mountain Lion. I reproduced with Go1.2 and Go1.1.2.\n\nI have attached a benchmark test with one that works as expected and one that tries to\nset the ReadBuffer size. The second test will never complete due to the net.Read() calls\nstalling.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n  test/benchmark completes\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n  Never completes.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n  6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\n  MacOSX Mavericks\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\n\n  go version go1.2 darwin/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/6930/0/mavbug_test.go\"\u003emavbug_test.go\u003c/a\u003e (1775 bytes)",
