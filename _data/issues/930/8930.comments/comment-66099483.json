And why do\nyou say this only now?\n\nThe perf dashboard worked well for half a year on goperfd.appspot.com and then for few\nmonths on build.golang.org. I don't see any issues, like fragility, with it.\n\nThe perf dashboard is intertwined with build dashboard because they participate in the\nsame workflows -- notifications about changes after new changes, checking status of\nrepo, trying new patches on builders. Separating them will just create lots of\nadditional work for everybody and will make user experience worse (e.g. you won't be\nable to filter duplicate notifications about breakages coming from build and perf).\n\nI don't see how moving it to a separate app will solve fragility or anything else.\n\nIf we want to make manual periodical updates of the database part of our workflow, we\njust need to fix the scripts to make it correctly.\u003c/pre\u003e",
