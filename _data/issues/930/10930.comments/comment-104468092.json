So we're thinking along similar lines.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of a server is that the overhead of executing the binary each time might prove significant when we're talking about 5ns-per-op benchmarks.\r\n\r\nI'm agnostic about whether the statistic engine should be internal or not. I just want it to be good, and I know that (1) that requires testing support and (2) that I personally lack the domain expertise to make it awesome. :)\r\n\r\n",
