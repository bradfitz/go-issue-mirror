We were seeing lots of random\nSIGSEGVs on 19c06a3356f8, so we updated to 457cc24872ec and the situation did not\nimprove.\n\nOur actual stack dumps are just as uninteresting as Roger's above. Like Roger's dump we\nhave many routines waiting on /runtime/znetpoll_linux_amd64.c:118, but I think that is\njust a popular place to block. Our application does not use cGo.\u003c/pre\u003e",
