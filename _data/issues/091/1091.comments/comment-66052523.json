Malloc?\n\nOn some systems I have used\nMMAP_THRESHHOLD=0\nto force the allocator to NOT use mmap to allocate. The symptoms sure\nlook like what happens when one uses mmap and forgets to munmap on\nfree OR forgets to use the freed memory somehow. I just dealt with\nexactly this problem on Blue Gene, although the context was very\ndifferent, the fix was to force the allocator back to using sbrk()\ninstead of mmap() for larger allocations.\n\n I'll look at the code I guess.\n\nron\u003c/pre\u003e",
