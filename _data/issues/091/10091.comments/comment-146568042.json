	"body": "Even though we can't rename the existing LookupFieldOrMethod, there's still a gap in the API.\r\n\r\nConsider (*ssa.Program).MethodValue(sel *types.Selection) *ssa.Function.    It requires a *types.Selection as its argument.  If you have the receiver type T and the selector name (pkg, name), you can obtain a Selection by calling types.NewMethodSet(T).Lookup(pkg, name), but this is asymptotically more expensive than calling types.LookupFieldOrMethod(T, false, pkg, name). \r\n\r\nIdeally the client would be able to call LookupFieldOrMethod and then construct a Selection (field or method) from the result, but there is no way for clients to construct a Selection.\r\n\r\nCould we expose a NewSelection constructor?",
