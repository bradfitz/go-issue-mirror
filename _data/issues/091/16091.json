What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\namd64 darwin\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\njust normal daily edit-compile-debug.\r\nnot an error, just an idea for faster compilation, for edit-compile-debug cycle (including restarting webserver), it would be nice to have `--fast-compile` mode even the compile binary not optimized is ok, as long it's fast to compile\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nnot waiting too long\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nfor each cycle, \r\nwaited about 4 seconds in 1.4 on linux\r\nwaited about 6 seconds in 1.4 on mac \r\nwaited about 8 seconds in 1.7b1 on mac\r\nthis still too much..\r\n\r\n",
