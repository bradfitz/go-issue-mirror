	"body": "I have an in-memory time-series data store ( https://github.com/dgryski/carbonmem ).\r\n\r\nI had a crash with Go 1.5beta2 but due to lack of logging lots the reason.  I upgraded to 1.5beta3, and had another panic, this time with\r\n\r\n```\r\nruntime/cgo: pthread_create failed: Resource temporarily unavailable\r\n```\r\n\r\nI upgraded to rc1, and today had another crash, this time with\r\n\r\n```\r\nfatal error: runtime: out of memory\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's highly unlikely this box is *actually* running out of memory.  It has 384G of RAM, and monitor the actual memory usage on the box doesn't show any sort of leak or spike in memory usage before the crash.\r\n\r\nThe only connection I can see between the crashes is that they've each happened approximately 10 days apart.\r\n\r\nI understand this is not a particularly useful bug report.  I'll try to get some more information from the process (repeated dumps of /debug/vars, etc) and maybe we can track it down to something in our environment rather than a bug in the Go runtime.",
