On linux, iproute2's \"ip ro add ... src\n...\" and \"equalize\" options should prove useful, or go for policy routing if you must.\n\nIt'll still pick a source address first, and then try to find a free port, so the\nbalancing is stochastic at best.\n\nBut this seems better to me than putting all this logic in the app.\u003c/pre\u003e",
