What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nOS X and Linux on Travis\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nBuild Hugo (https://github.com/spf13/hugo).\r\n\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nSee https://travis-ci.org/spf13/hugo/builds/121437210\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nAll green.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nBuild fails on Go tip, both OS X and Linux. \r\n\r\nI tried to see if this is a duplicate of an already reported issue, but it's hard to tell.\r\n\r\nThere is a test failure that I haven't looked into, but then there are these build failures:\r\n\r\n```\r\n19.35s$ go build -race\r\n\r\n# github.com/pkg/sftp\r\n\r\n../../pkg/sftp/client.go:829: internal error: (*File).WriteTo autotmp_781 (type *[]byte) recorded as live on entry, p.Pc=10248\r\n\r\n# github.com/russross/blackfriday\r\n\r\n../../russross/blackfriday/html.go:932: internal error: (*Html).ensureUniqueHeaderID autotmp_747 (type *int) recorded as live on entry, p.Pc=15486\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure when these failures started to happen ...\r\n\r\n",
