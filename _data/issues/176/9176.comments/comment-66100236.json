There is no way to replace wait4\nwith a non-NULL rusage parameter with waitpid.  The waitid system call takes an rusage\nparameter, but is only available since 2.6.9, so it is too early to switch.  And since\nwait4 will never actually go away, there is no reason to switch.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
