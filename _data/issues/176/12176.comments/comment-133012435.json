I have reason to believe that after ~10 days of traffic, one of the metrics gets enough leaves that the radix tree supporting prefix queries is determined to be \"full\" and freed, leaving a *very* large amount of work for the garbage collector to do.  If this is related to https://github.com/golang/go/commit/3ae17043f7f29f0d745aa35b340f8cab80219068 , then this patch was not present in rc1 but *was* present in 1.5 final so the bug should not be occurring.  I will build the server with 1.5 final on Monday and report back in a few weeks.",
