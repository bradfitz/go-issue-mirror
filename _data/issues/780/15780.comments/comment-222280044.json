	"body": "Thanks, Ian. The GCC restrictions on bitmasks suggests that I'd do well enough ignoring them for the moment, so that's what I'll do, which makes the path forward very clear. And that paper is actually where I started on this--it's very useful and well-written.\r\n\r\nGo also has non-integer switches, which themselves are interesting and appear to be less-well-covered territory in the literature--e.g. #15164 and the general question of whether we should use tries of some kind for switches over strings. Yet more reason to keep the integer handling relatively simple.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor my own future reference, here are couple of other notes:\r\n\r\n* If we had jump tables, \"Efficient multiway search radix tree\" might help with bit type switches, since they are sparse and integer-ish.\r\n* Paper on LLVM's switch lowering: http://llvm.org/pubs/2007-05-31-Switch-Lowering.pdf. Mostly covers the same territory as the others, although it presents a heuristic for finding the pivot for binary search--I'm not convinced yet.\r\n* Consider joining ranges when there is a small gap, and then testing for the gap.\r\n* Recognize switches used to implement static data or static lookup and convert.\r\n",
