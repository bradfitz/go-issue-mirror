	"body": "\u003chttps://LetsEncrypt.org\u003e's release is just around the corner, but it's currently not possible to dynamically retrieve and renew certificates in go with an active http server.\r\n\r\nTo do so requires fixing a tiny regression introduced sometime between the move from httputils and now. See https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httputil/#ServerConn.\r\n\r\nWe need to re-expose `http.NewConn` and `http.conn.Serve`.\r\n\r\nI've got a working demo of dynamically loading certificates with this change here:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/coolaj86/16ed8fd810e19dec71be\r\n\r\nI've already signed the CLA and with a little coaching I'm sure I could turn my example into an appropriate test case.",
