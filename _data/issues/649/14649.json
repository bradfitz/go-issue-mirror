	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.6 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOOS=\"darwin\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n(Use play.golang.org to provide a runnable example, if possible.)\r\nRead https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/x509/#CreateCertificateRequest\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\"CreateCertificateRequest creates a new certificate request based on a template.\"\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\"CreateCertificateRequest creates a new certificate based on a template.\"\r\n\r\nThis was really confusing for a minute because there is currently no exposed function in x509 that creates a certificate from a request, but that sentence implies that's what CreateCertificateRequest does, even though the name of the function makes it sort of obvious that's not what it does.\r\n",
