	"body": "So thanks for pointing that out but could I get some clarification on the design intent as you see it?  With exporting that method and the `Marshal` method, there isn't really a reason to have any of the methods for basic messages (env, signal, pty-req, etc).  Since some of them are implemented, it must be some balance between bloat and convenience; I'm just offering up a little bit more convenience for anyone wanting to use this message type.\r\n\r\nTo utilize those I have to do the exact code I'm submitting here; it seems to me that it just makes sense to do it once in the ssh library rather than in every consumer of the library that otherwise doesn't even have to know about the exact RFC implementation.",
