I would expect most people to use Java for the foundation of the application in cases when overlays, ads, and precise control over styles and manifest are desired and would use the Go library for performance critical tasks. (Vector, Graphics, Collision libraries).\r\n\r\nIt would be also nice to have a more detailed documentation on the threading model that is currently used. For me personally it is not quite clear on which thread are Go functions, that have been invoked from JNI, executed. Is it always the same thread, could it be a different one each time? Is the same go routine reused or a new one per call?",
