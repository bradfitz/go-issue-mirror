I guess if it were possible for end-users to instantiate a `Context` instance that did direct GL calls internally (instead of adding them to a queue), it might work.\r\n\r\nI did some experimentations in making direct GL calls accessible from Java and it seemed to work, when used from the [GLSurfaceView.Renderer](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/opengl/GLSurfaceView.Renderer.html) methods, which makes me believe that the same thread is used in the Go-side when doing JNI. I could not find the later documented anywhere, however, so I could have just been lucky.\r\n\r\n",
