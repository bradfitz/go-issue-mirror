Edit `dashboard/builders.go` to set the `IsReverse` field on the `windows-amd64-gce` builder config to `true`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ coordinator -mode dev\r\n$ buildlet -coordinator localhost:8119 -halt=false -reverse windows-amd64-gce\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can run `release -coordinator localhost:8119` to use your local coordinator and buildlet for the release build.\r\n\r\nOr you could just run `releaselet.go` from a directory that contains a `go` directory containing a compiled Go tree. (and stub out the stuff in `releaselet.go` that tries to do the godoc/tour stuff)",
