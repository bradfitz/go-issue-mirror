Then `x/net` with the potential to promote it to the standard library at a later stage.\r\n\r\n\u003e what would be the maintenance policy of the branches on x/net?\r\n\r\nPackages in the sub-repositories are expected to be relatively stable unless marked otherwise, but they do not fall under the Go 1 compatibility promise. Heavily under-development or speculative packages sometimes live in the `x/exp` repo or `exp` directories inside a repo.\r\n\r\nThe `x/tools` and `x/net` repository both have release branch tags because parts of them are bundled in each binary release. We don't expect people to check out or work on those branches.\r\n\r\nSo I guess the question is: who is the package for? ",
