Also more people would be able to help you if you provide an [MCVE](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).\r\n\r\nThe workaround I originally proposed at [golang-ru](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-ru/qoNDWMFR988/4vs7pW2OZNgJ) is to replace all namespaced attributes in test with a modified one, i.e. replace `\u003citunes:author\u003e` with `\u003citunes:_author\u003e` and then unmarshal it into a separate field. I don't know whether it could help you.",
