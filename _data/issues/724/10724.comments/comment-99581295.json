Death by a thousand cuts, straw camel back, etc.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer to move this into Go code in src/cmd/dist/test.go and then it would be much easier to do things like sleep up to 1 second (measuring how long the previous commands took), and do things like check the inode for other changes, if applicable first. It's also easier to parallelize things in Go.\r\n",
