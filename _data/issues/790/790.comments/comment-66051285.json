Shortly after submitting this report, I realized I\nhad not closed\nthe channel and was going to try that but ghexsel beat me to it and indicated that the\nproblem\nexists even when the channel is closed.   While I accept any semantics you wish to place\non netchans,\nI would have to say that not flushing at close-time is quite non-intuitive to me based\non past \nexperience.  Thanks again.\n--ralph\u003c/pre\u003e",
