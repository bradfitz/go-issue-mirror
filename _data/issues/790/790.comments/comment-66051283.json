The problem is \nthat it exits immediately after sending the last message, since main returns.  All\nthat's needed to fix it is a sleep or other \noperation to keep the binary running long enough for netchan to push out the data.\n\nA flush operation would help but I hesitate to add one because the exporter has no\nbusiness exiting while it has clients.  \nThe netchan code will push the data out with no further operations as long as it is\nallowed to run.\n\nIn short, your test programs are buggy.\n\nIf this problem arises again, I will consider a mechanism for clean teardown of the\ntransmitter, but it seems unnecessary.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
