I changed your test to use syscalls only (to see if problem goes away) and it does go away. And syscalls only version is much faster than your original version. I also built another version that uses channels only, and that is even faster. Here https://play.golang.org/p/JmZcyYUgTz are my test. If I run them I see this:\r\n```\r\nC:\\dev\\src\\issues\\issue14790\u003ego test -bench=.\r\ntesting: warning: no tests to run\r\nBenchmarkDefaultResolution                    50          31563106 ns/op\r\nBenchmark1ms                                1000           1956129 ns/op\r\nBenchmarkNoChannelDefaultResolution       300000              4322 ns/op\r\nBenchmarkNoChannel1ms                     300000              4287 ns/op\r\nBenchmarkOnlyChannelDefaultResolution    3000000               484 ns/op\r\nBenchmarkOnlyChannel1ms                  3000000               481 ns/op\r\nPASS\r\nok      issues/issue14790       10.854s\r\n\r\nC:\\dev\\src\\issues\\issue14790\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in addition to your original issue, I am wondering why BenchmarkNoChannel1ms is ~500 times faster then Benchmark1ms. BenchmarkOnlyChannel1ms is even ~10 times faster, but that sounds reasonable to me (internal sync comparing to external).\r\n\r\n@dvyukov and @aclements if you can explain what is happening here. Or maybe suggestion on how to investigate this further. Thank you.\r\n\r\nAlex",
