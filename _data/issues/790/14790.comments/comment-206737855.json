Thanks for confirming.\r\n\r\n\u003e For GOMAXPROCS=1, it's still much slower ...\r\n\r\nI know that. Unfortunetly it is how Go's scheduler works at this moment. Maybe it will improve one day.\r\n\r\n\u003e do you still intend to restore the timeBeginPeriod call in the runtime?\r\n\r\nYes. We are going back to calling timeBeginPeriod(1) as before. See https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/20834/ for details.\r\n\r\nAlex",
