You're right that one of the roles of sysmon is to decide when a system call is probably blocked and that we should start up another thread to execute goroutines, but it's a very coarse mechanism, and the poor resolution of Windows timers really isn't helping here. This isn't usually an issue because most syscalls that block for a long time are socket IO and those go through a central select() mechanism, but you may have come across a case where it is an issue.\r\n\r\nIn the runtime, we actually do have a way to indicate that a system call is blocking (`entersyscall` versus `entersyscallblock`) and we should schedule another goroutine immediately, but it looks like we only use this mechanism on Solaris. I don't know why that is.",
