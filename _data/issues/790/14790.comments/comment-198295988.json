The high latency with GOMAXPROCS=1 is explained by the fact that the single P needs to be constantly retaken by sysmon thread to allow the other goroutine to run. Sysmon uses sleeps and so bounded by system time resolution. To fix that we need to restore timeBeginPeriod (at least the delay will go down from 15ms to 1ms).\r\n\r\nBut my change does help when GOMAXPROCS\u003e1:\r\n\r\nBenchmarkDefaultResolution-8  4583372   29720    -99.35%\r\nBenchmark1ms-8                992056    30701    -96.91%\r\n\r\nHere we are not even limited by sysmon sleeps because we have enough Ps to execute all runnable goroutines. This fix is even more important than timeBeginPeriod, because GOMAXPROCS=1 is rather esoteric today.",
