Your suggestion still does not explain why, for example, BenchmarkNoChannel1ms is about 450 times faster than Benchmark1ms:\r\n```\r\nC:\\dev\\src\\issues\\issue14790\u003ego test -bench=1ms\r\ntesting: warning: no tests to run\r\nBenchmark1ms                1000           1961788 ns/op\r\nBenchmarkNoChannel1ms     300000              4397 ns/op\r\nBenchmarkOnlyChannel1ms  3000000               498 ns/op\r\nPASS\r\nok      issues/issue14790       5.580s\r\n\r\nC:\\dev\\src\\issues\\issue14790\u003e\r\n```\r\nWhy do you think this is? How can I find out?\r\n\r\n\u003e IMO the long-term solution is #7876. It would allow to raise sysmon sleep to that same 15ms.\r\n\r\nI don't want to look for solution until I understand what my particular problem is.\r\n\r\nAlex",
