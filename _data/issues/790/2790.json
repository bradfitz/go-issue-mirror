	"body": "by **daniel@heroku.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eAlthough it's already possible to link C code into a Go program (that controls the entry\npoint), it would be highly useful to me to have the opposite (running a Go runtime in a\nC program).\n\nI'm mostly interested in exposing exported Go symbols and bindings to Python (and Ruby,\nJava, and similar), and PostgreSQL.  In the latter case, the sandboxed variant of Go\nprovides a more unique advantage as it can be run as a \u0026quot;trusted\u0026quot; language.\u003c/pre\u003e",
