I tested the\naddress with telnet from two different network connections (verizon, comcast) and found\nthat telnet also hangs.\n\nI am guessing that the data center at 74.125.19.99 is down for scheduled maintenance. \nThe tests should be updated to use the address of a service without scheduled downtime.\n\nI am willing to submit a CL if somebody can provide a good IP address to use.\u003c/pre\u003e",
