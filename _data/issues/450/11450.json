	"body": "We should probably provide a mechanism in Go 1.5 to let users force the use of cgo/libc for DNS resolution. I'm afraid the pure Go solution will have problems for some users, and saying \"modifying your nsswitch.conf or resolv.conf to be 'complicated enough'\" isn't a great answer.\r\n\r\nSo, two questions:\r\n\r\n1) should we do this?  (I think yes)\r\n2) which mechanism? env var? build tag? (I'm undecided).\r\n\r\n/cc @pmarks-net @mikioh @ianlancetaylor @rsc ",
