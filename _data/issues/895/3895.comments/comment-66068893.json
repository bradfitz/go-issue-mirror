One is to include in the .a file a hash of all\nthe source file content that went into it (or the file names and mtimes). The hash will\nnot match if a file is missing. Another, partial fix is to use a background process that\nwatches file changes for the go command. It would see the deletion and be able to tell\nthe go command that the package is out of date. That would speed ordinary builds too,\nand is something I want to explore for 1.3.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **go1.3maybe**._",
