When I do that, a subdirectory with the same name of the .aar file (and hence the name of the Android project) gets created and the .aar file is moved from the project directory to this subdirectory.\r\nI can now successfully access all the Go functions defined in this .aar which has been moved to such subdirectory.\r\n\r\n3)\r\nIf I make some changes to my Go library and then run `./gradlew gobind` again, an .aar file gets added again to the project directory, but the .arr file of the subdirectory (which is the one linked to the Android project) doesn't get updated, and hence I am not able to use the updated Go library",
