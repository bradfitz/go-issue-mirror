In fact docker uses LXC, but I don't see how it's relevant.\n\nBut, as you pointed out, the 108 character limit comes from Linux, not Go.  So this\ndoesn't seem like a Go issue to me.  So it's fine with me if you reject this issue.  I\napologize for not realizing earlier that the limitation comes from Linux.\u003c/pre\u003e",
