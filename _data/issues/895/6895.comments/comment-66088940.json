I didn't\nmention anything about a NUL-terminated filepath and I don't understand why the summary\nwas changed to indicate that.  Don't the Go libraries convert the Go string to a C\nstring before calling bind?\n\n\u003e\u003e not just the length of the file name itself.\n\u003eWhat's your expectation?\n\nMy expectation is that net.Listen returns successfully for a socket path name string\nthat is \u003e= 108 characters.\u003c/pre\u003e",
