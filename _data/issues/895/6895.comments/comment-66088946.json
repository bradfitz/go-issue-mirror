It comes from sockaddr_un of Linux,  on some BSDs it's 104.\n\nWell, looks like we need to introduce some indirection layer, (layering is harmful,\nyay!), in between \"filesystem namespace\" and \"unix domain socket path namespace\" to fill\nthe gap. On Linux using proc filesystem for shortening and bridging namespaces is a most\npopular (really?) way but it doesn't work on other Unix system and it might break Go API\ncompatibility. But sooner or later we'll face this sort of issues on software container\nenvironment such as LXC on Linux or Jail on FreeBSD because they isolate some resource\nnamespaces but don't provide bridging stuff unlike Plan 9, PlanetLab blah blah blah.\n\nThoughts?\n\n@joshpoimboeuf: As you mentioned above, making your own docker's IPC pathname shortener\nlibrary on Linux might be a fast and robust solution, for now.\u003c/pre\u003e",
