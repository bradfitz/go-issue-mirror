	"body": "go version devel +57b1e55 Sat Jan 9 03:30:40 2016 +0000 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\nI'm building a graphical program using x/exp/shiny, and recently I started getting this error whenever a mouse event is generated:\r\n\r\nSegmentation fault: 11\r\n\r\nI'm on a Mac, and using the \"report to apple\" dialogue that pops up, I also get the following (full output attached):\r\n```\r\n...\r\nCrashed Thread:        0  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\r\nException Type:        EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)\r\nException Codes:       KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE at 0x00007fff5f3ffff8\r\n...\r\nThread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\r\n0   edit                          \t0x0000000004040a25 runtime.sighandler + 725 (signal_amd64x.go:129)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure if this is a bug in the darwin code for shiny, a new bug introduced with the recent changes to signal handling, or an older bug that I've somehow tickled.\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this consistently by running e.g. golang.org/x/exp/shiny/example/tile, and clicking. The error message varies between \"signal: segmentation fault\" and \"Segmentation fault: 11\".\r\n\r\nRunning with -race does not report any data races.\r\n\r\n[full crash report](https://github.com/golang/go/files/83945/report.txt)",
