	"body": "We also have such a timeout set by default, if you use any of the default methods to fetch URLs (http.Get, http.Post, http.DefaultClient, etc). That default is here:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nvar DefaultTransport RoundTripper = \u0026Transport{\r\n        Proxy: ProxyFromEnvironment,\r\n        Dial: (\u0026net.Dialer{\r\n                Timeout:   30 * time.Second,\r\n                KeepAlive: 30 * time.Second,\r\n        }).Dial,\r\n        TLSHandshakeTimeout: 10 * time.Second,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's true that if you go lower-level and wire stuff up yourself, you get what you ask for.\r\n\r\nI suppose a question is whether we should have a DefaultDialer too, and document that custom Transports with a nil Dial func end up using DefaultDial.\r\n\r\n(But another question is why your network component drops connections without sending a FIN, but I understand that things do weird things.)\r\n\r\nRelated: at least in Go 1.6, idempotent requests are retried on a new connection, which mitigates this partially.\r\n",
