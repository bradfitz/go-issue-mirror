I have not forgot about it and still keep an \"unread\"\nemail about this issue in my personal e-mail. It just goes that I still don't have time\nfor a serious attack for this issue due to the rush on my primary job.\n\nIn short, before closing this bug with the words \"not reproducible\", I would like to run\ncompressor on a large set of text documents and see how this will work.\n\nSorry for being so unresponsive so far.\u003c/pre\u003e",
