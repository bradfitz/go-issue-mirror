Any analysis ended up with \"this can't happen,\nbecause it can't happen ever\" exclamation. This likely means that I miss something\nobvious.\n\nAnyway, I want to proceed to the plan B: improve diagnostics to be prepared to the next\ntime. What do you prefer: a modified compress/flate or a modified planfile.go?\n\nA modified Go runtime has a drawback that it's unlikely to be used by anybody else than\nyou and given the low rate of this crash, all odds that the next time it would fail not\non your machine.\n\nI am fine to provide a patch to any of these components.\n\nIf you choose to patch planfile, I would really appreciate an instruction how to build\nit, because it seems that planfile is not Go installable:\n\n$ go get github.com/tav/planfile-app\npackage github.com/tav/planfile-app\n\timports amp/crypto: unrecognized import path \"amp/crypto\"\npackage github.com/tav/planfile-app\n\timports amp/httputil: unrecognized import path \"amp/httputil\"\npackage github.com/tav/planfile-app\n\timports amp/log: unrecognized import path \"amp/log\"\npackage github.com/tav/planfile-app\n\timports amp/oauth: unrecognized import path \"amp/oauth\"\npackage github.com/tav/planfile-app\n\timports amp/optparse: unrecognized import path \"amp/optparse\"\npackage github.com/tav/planfile-app\n\timports amp/runtime: unrecognized import path \"amp/runtime\"\npackage github.com/tav/planfile-app\n\timports amp/tlsconf: unrecognized import path \"amp/tlsconf\"\u003c/pre\u003e",
