To answer your various questions:\n\n1. It's not regular, and I've only seen it once â€” but Seyi, a fellow hacker, has\nindependently experienced it too:\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://raw.github.com/gist/be2ae5a6b629ba4ebb48/9278242906f2b9f8f516e4dd90ba8f5e3e1554a9/error.log\"\u003ehttps://raw.github.com/gist/be2ae5a6b629ba4ebb48/9278242906f2b9f8f516e4dd90ba8f5e3e1554a9/error.log\u003c/a\u003e\n\n2. Only experienced the crash once each so far. But, having said that, we've not been\nrunning the code in production yet.\n\n4. We've not isolated it down to an individual request yet. Request data sizes currently\nvary all the way up to around 21kb uncompressed.\n\n5. Yes, I can add code to log the requests.\n\n6. Yes, I can compile/run modified Go runtimes.\u003c/pre\u003e",
