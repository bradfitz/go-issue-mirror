(you can use the '-benchmem' flag to see allocations and use '-memprofile \u003cfile\u003e' to create a profile of your allocations. [see here for more information](http://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs). you can also use '-gcflags -S' to see the assembly generated by the compiler)\r\n\r\n**Update:** See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/nuss-justin/2a4996fc19f6e2bcc744) for a small example of this allocation.",
