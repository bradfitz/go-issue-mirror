The reason for this decrease is that 25.9% time is spent on \"runtime.morestack\", which does not appear in 1 Core benchmark.\r\n\r\nI also profiled the time consumption of BenchmarkNoIfaceWrite under 32 Cores, which does not involve memory allocation. I see \"runtime.newObject\" and \"runtime.morestack\" do not appear also.\r\n![32-cores-nomalloc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4866453/12383643/fec2cdb8-bd6d-11e5-83c4-c4fe7de37499.png)\r\n\r\nI hope this could help you improve Golang. In fact, the advice from the above comments help me a lot with my project.",
