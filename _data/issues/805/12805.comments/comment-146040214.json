We can't override that without refactor\nthem to use a centralized cpu feature detection facility.\n\nI'm wondering if we could have a runtime/cpu package that\nprovide a public interface to query CPU capabilities?\nwe can't just have an internal package because some of\nthe code in sub-repo also needs CPU feature detection.\n\nIf we have a standard interface, then 3rdparty code will also\nbenefit from this kind of testing without forcing to test on\na large variety of machines.\n\nIf you think this standard interface is reasonable, I can write\na proposal.\n\nBasically, the runtime/cpu package will provide overridable\nruntime cpu feature detection.\n",
