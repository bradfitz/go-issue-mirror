The\n\u003e runtime needs to know very early on some of the processor flags so that it\n\u003e can initialize properly (alg tables in particular, maybe other things).\n\u003e The runtime package shouldn't be allowed to import any other packages.\n\u003e Currently the runtime only imports unsafe (which is, paradoxically, safe to\n\u003e import because it contains no code, no initializers, ...). It sounds dicey\n\u003e to allow anything more substantial. How would that package get\n\u003e initialized? Where would it get a stack?\n\u003e\n\u003e That said, runtime will always be special. This proposal sounds reasonable\n\u003e for use by all other packages. Maybe the implementation can be in package\n\u003e runtime and runtime/cpu gets magic unexported access to runtime (ala\n\u003e reflect). At that point, though, why not just add the API to runtime\n\u003e directly?\n\u003e\n\nI'd imagine the runtime/cpu package would depend on internal functions from\ninside the runtime package, the same way time does.\n",
