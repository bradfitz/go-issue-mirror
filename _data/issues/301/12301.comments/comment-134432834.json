	"body": "Thanks. Just skimmed interface_windows.go and looks like the code is broken. At least about the following:\r\n\r\n- It doesn't list up all equipped interfaces because of https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/interface_windows.go#L110\r\n- It makes wrong address prefixes because of https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/interface_windows.go#L167. It should take prefixes instead of addresses, prefix lengths instead of socket structure lengths",
