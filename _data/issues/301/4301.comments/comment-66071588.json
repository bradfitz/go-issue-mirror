That being said, there are many reliable ways to detect mobile safari.\n\nSince this has bitten me as well (reading the spec on my iPad) I'm more than happy to\nhelp. The top-level goal being that we find a solution that doesn't rely on browser\nchecks to work everywhere.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to start working on a patch.\u003c/pre\u003e",
