	"body": "They've uncovered a lot of problems (for example, #11105). However, the problems uncovered are mostly preexisting problems we'd have had anyway, so we're debugging things we needed to debug anyway (but didn't know). Overall this seems like a positive thing.\n\nEven so, it is trivial to disable stack barriers, so we should make a decision later in the freeze about whether to do so.\n\n@aclements @RLH",
