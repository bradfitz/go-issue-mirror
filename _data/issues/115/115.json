Set up environmental variables which include spaces.\n $ export GOROOT=\u0026quot;${HOME}/Development Projects/go\u0026quot;\n2. Clone the Go source tree:\n hg clone -r release \u003ca href=\"https://go.googlecode.com/hg/\"\u003ehttps://go.googlecode.com/hg/\u003c/a\u003e \u0026quot;$GOROOT\u0026quot;\n3. Try to build Go:\n cd \u0026quot;$GOROOT\u0026quot;/src; ./all.bash\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nI expect to see build progress. I actually get:\n make.bash: line 10: test: /Users/alex/Development: binary operator expected\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n$GOOS=darwin\n$GOARCH=386\n\nBut I think both are irrelevant hereâ€¦\n\nWhich revision are you sync'ed to?  (hg log -l 1)\nAgain, irrelevant I think, but see above: it's the 'release' tag.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI side-stepped this problem by making a symlink at '$HOME/.go' pointing to \n'$HOME/Development Projects/go', and set '$HOME/.go' as $GOROOT. It's not a true fix\nthough.\u003c/pre\u003e",
