So\nthen if we changed things, we'd be in a situation where we first LookPath in the current\ndirectory and only if that fails, then LookPath in the cmd.Dir later at Run time. \nThat's even more surprising: now there's two paths that are searched, and it depends on\nthe context (current dir) of the program where it was run which one is used.\n\nSo I really doubt we can change it.\n\nMaybe we can improve the error messages, though.\u003c/pre\u003e",
