That\nis in fact the documented behaviour.  Calling LookPath in that case does not actually do\nanything except check whether the named file exists, which will be done by the exec call\nanyhow.\n\nUnfortunately we can't literally not call LookPath as that will do the wrong thing on\nPlan 9 and Windows in some cases.  So instead I suggest that if Command is called with a\nrelative path, and LookPath returns an exec.Error whose err value is an os.IsNotExist\nerror, Command should ignore the error.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
