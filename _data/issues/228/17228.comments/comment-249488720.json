	"body": "@minux, c++ references are just const pointers but fake as not in most implementations. \r\nIn fact, maps and channels in Golang are very possibly implemented also like this. (for slices, surely not)\r\n\r\nThe problem of the go faq is not to choose a proper word to describe the implementation. \r\nIt is how to make a more consistent explanation for map/slice/channel values and other general values.\r\nAgain, my opinion is it is unnecessary to choose a word, now \"reference value\" used in go faq, to make maps/slices/channels as special values.\r\n\r\nThe more consistent explanation for map/slice/channel values is just describe them as pointer wrappers so that the word \"reference value\" can be eliminated totally from go faq. By doing this, much confusions can be avoided.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the word \"reference\" has been removed from go spec long long ago, why not remove it from go faq also?",
