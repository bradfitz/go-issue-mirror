	"body": "By calling map/slices/channels reference values, is the reason for they are pointer wrappers?\r\nIf this is the reason, then any custom struct values containing pointer fields should also be called reference values. The faq shouldn't make map/slices/channels look special on this point.\r\n\r\nWith the reference concept in faq, it gives people the impression that the implementations of Map/Slice/Channel are different from Struct. In fact, there is no differences. \r\n\r\nThe docs for syntax should be as simple and consistent as possible. By eliminating the reference concept, the docs will be clearer. \r\n\r\nBTW, @minux, map/slices/channels don't behave like C++'s reference, they behave some like Java's but not totally the same.\r\n\r\nBTW2, @bradfitz, the problem is not to choose a proper word definition, the problem is the docs is not consistent. My opinion is it is unnecessary to choose a word to make maps/slices/channels as special values.",
