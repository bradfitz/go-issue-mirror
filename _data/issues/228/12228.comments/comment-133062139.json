Another thing you could try if you care only about throughput is to set GODEBUG=gcstoptheworld=1.\r\n\r\nIt looks like your heap sizes are pretty similar for most of the run, and you have a similar number of GC cycles, so it's not purely that 1.5 is collecting more aggressively. It does look like the 1.5 GC is running flat-out for much of the middle of your run, which means you're paying the various costs of running concurrently with the GC most of the time:\r\n\r\n![12228](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2688315/9388349/c63387c8-4732-11e5-943b-1230f7c26133.png)\r\n\r\n(15s to 20s of your 1.5 gctrace, created with https://github.com/aclements/go-gcstats. The green bar shows the heap size that triggers the GC and the red bar shows the heap size it's aiming to finish at.)\r\n\r\nThere are some strange bits in here too, like when the trigger goes above the goal. I filed #12199 a few days ago to track that problem.",
