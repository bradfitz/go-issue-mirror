It's not a problem for me to do those if you think it is still useful for something. Please let me know.\r\n\r\nYes, I would like to have a look at the GODEBUG output if you don't mind. It would be better if you didn't have to set GOGC at all and the GODEBUG output should give us a sense of why 1.5 is collecting more aggressively, which may feed in to our plans for improving GC in 1.6.",
