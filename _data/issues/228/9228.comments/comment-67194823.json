Most Go programmers keep *all* their Go source code\n\u003e and dependencies in a single workspace.\n\u003e\n\u003e\nWhen I read this I was thinking \"but how do I version control separate\nprojects if they're all in one workspace?\" because I was still equating\nrepositories and workspaces.  Go is fairly unique in *not* equating these\nand I think this document should be more explicit about this.\n\nLooking back at the document now I see one \".git\" nested in the workspace\nthat hints at this, but this is really too subtle.  There's also some\ndiscussion of this under \"remote packages\", but at the time I was\ninterested in how to lay out my projects, not remote packages.",
