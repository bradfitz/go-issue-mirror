	"body": "I'm writing a code writing tool that uses AST analysis and transformation to produce specific implementations of generic algorithms on matching types. Part of this process is analyzing what imports from the 'type provider' file need to be added to the specific implementation of the generic code in order to be correct.\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n\r\n### Type Provider\r\n    package main\r\n    import \"go/ast\"\r\n    type Decls []*ast.GenDecl\r\n\r\n### Generic Algorithm\r\n    package main\r\n    type Collection []interface\r\n    func (c Collection) Filter(fn func(interface{}) bool) (result Collection) {}\r\n\r\n### Expected Result\r\n    package main\r\n    import \"go/ast\"\r\n    func (c Decls) Filter(fn func(*ast.GenDecl) bool) (result Decls) {}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt honestly shouldn't be hard to roll my own, but ast.FilterFile at least presents itself as the canonical implementation of what I'm trying to do. It's ok if it can't change, but maybe the documentation should be updated to indicate the limitation if that's the case.",
