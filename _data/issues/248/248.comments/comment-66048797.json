At minimum, something needs to be placed in the\ndocumentation as it's \nespecially counterintuitive to get a PathError on a socket. EAGAIN is a common case that\nmust be handled and \ndoing so appropriately requires a bit more code than I feel it should.\n\nI can't think of a simple fix without operator overloading, but I'll have to give it\nmore though as I think this is \nimportant. A stop-gap would be to define IsEAGAIN in net, as in fd, but this feels\nclumsy.\n\nfunc IsEAGAIN(e os.Error) bool {\n  if e1, ok := e.(*os.PathError); ok {o\n    return e1.Error == os.EAGAIN\n  }\n  return e == os.EAGAIN\n}\u003c/pre\u003e",
