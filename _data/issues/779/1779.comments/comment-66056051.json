All that space is for cases where SEH kicks in. Go does not use it, no matter\nhow big StackBig in 8l is, because it is essentially a giant part StackGuard (and 8l\ncompares sp against G.stackguard, which includes both StackGuard and StackSystem, so\nbigger StackBig can only cause more unnecessary stack checks, so comment in 8l is\nmisleading, it doesn't use larger stacks, all that space is unusable). Also there are\nsome more places where StackGuard is substracted without StackSystem when comparing\nstack pointers. This doesn't cause problems now, but still feels strange.\n\nrsc, if you are reading this, what do you think about actually making StackSystem a part\nof StackGuard? (because when I think about it, it sure acts like nothing but a part of\nStackGuard).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1779/3/go-win-stack.diff\"\u003ego-win-stack.diff\u003c/a\u003e (1483 bytes)",
