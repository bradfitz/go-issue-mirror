Then when exception strikes and windows runtimeÂ·sigtramp is called,\nfirst thing we do is set m.gsignal to be used as our stack for the time of the handler.\n\nI don't know, if your suggestion is useful or not. But, I don't think it will solve the\nproblem at hand.\n\nYou're welcome to submit you code (\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/contribute.html)\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/contribute.html)\u003c/a\u003e, it does look\nlike simplify things a bit, but I'm not sure if it is correct.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
