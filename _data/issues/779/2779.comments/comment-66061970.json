If so, you'd have\nmultiple calls to t.Reader.Read going at once,\nwhich is typically not allowed by most readers,\nand it could explain the crash.\n\nCan you reproduce the crash without the timeout\nreader?  The gzip decompressor is completely\ndeterministic, so if not, that's a strong signal that\nthe timeout reader is causing what I was describing.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
