For a variable x of type I where I is an interface type, x.f denotes the actual\nmethod with name f of the value assigned to x if there is such a method. If no value or\nnil was assigned to x, x.f is illegal.\n\nThis is wrong. x.f is never illegal in this case (illegal elsewhere means the compiler\nrejects the program), it just causes a runtime panic when called.\u003c/pre\u003e",
