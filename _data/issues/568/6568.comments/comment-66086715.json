After changing cmd into utf-8 mode(chcp 65001),i rebuilt\nGo source, Now the fail information is:\n\n--- FAIL: TestPacketConn (0.20 seconds)\n        packetconn_test.go:105: PacketConn.ReadFrom failed: WSARecvFrom udp 127.\n0.0.1:53439: i/o timeout\nFAIL\nFAIL    net     3.746s\n--- FAIL: TestIdentityResponse (0.01 seconds)\n        serve_test.go:453: error with Get of \u003ca href=\"http://127.0.0.1:1309/?overwrite=1\"\u003ehttp://127.0.0.1:1309/?overwrite=1\u003c/a\u003e\n Get \u003ca href=\"http://127.0.0.1:1309/?overwrite=1\"\u003ehttp://127.0.0.1:1309/?overwrite=1\u003c/a\u003e EOF\nFAIL\n\n--- FAIL: TestWinSplitListTestsAreValid (1.09 seconds)\n        path_windows_test.go:76: 7,0: execution error exit status 1\n                \"'printdir.cmd' is not recognized as an internal or external com\nmand,\\r\\noperable program or batch file.\\r\\n\"\n        path_windows_test.go:76: 9,0: execution error exit status 1\n                \"'printdir.cmd' is not recognized as an internal or external com\nmand,\\r\\noperable program or batch file.\\r\\n\"\n        path_windows_test.go:76: 11,0: execution error exit status 1\n                \"'printdir.cmd' is not recognized as an internal or external com\nmand,\\r\\noperable program or batch file.\\r\\n\"\n        path_windows_test.go:76: 12,1: execution error exit status 1\n                \"'printdir.cmd' is not recognized as an internal or external com\nmand,\\r\\noperable program or batch file.\\r\\n\"\n        path_windows_test.go:76: 13,1: execution error exit status 1\n                \"'printdir.cmd' is not recognized as an internal or external com\nmand,\\r\\noperable program or batch file.\\r\\n\"\nFAIL\nFAIL    path/filepath   27.224s\n\n\nFYI,There was none 'printdir.cmd' file on my system %windir% directory and then i added\nit according to an instruction(link: \u003ca href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/321379/en-us)\"\u003ehttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/321379/en-us)\u003c/a\u003e.\nI also tried changing the regedit key name from 'Printdir.bat' into 'printdir.cmd' but\nit does not work. It just said 'printdir.cmd' is not recognized as an internal or\nexternal command.\u003c/pre\u003e",
