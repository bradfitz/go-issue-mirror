	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Run this code \u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/2493934\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/2493934\u003c/a\u003e\n2. Look at the network pane in Task Manager or tally up bytes and display it per second\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nFull saturation of the 100mbps network interface.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nDeteriorated performance different depending on the machine, nic, etc...\n\nMachine 1, Intel nic: ~100mbps\nMachine 1, Realtek nic: ~15mbps\nMachine 2, Realtek nic: ~33mbps\n\nThe same program written in C can send 100mbps in any case.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\u0026quot;go build\u0026quot; on Windows using Go1 x86, x64, and latest source.\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows x64\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nGo1 x86, x64 and latest source.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nA write loop on a UDP socket has strange performance problems. A loop writing []byte\nwith length 1472 has had 15mbps on one machine and 33mbps on another. Changing the\n[]byte to length 1000 gives me about 100mbps on either machine.\u003c/pre\u003e",
