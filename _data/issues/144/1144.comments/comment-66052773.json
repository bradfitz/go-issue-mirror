That's what my note at the end of the\nfirst post was trying to say.\n\nI am a little rusty on my compilers, so I was using the colloquial definition of \"use\".\nI suppose I think a different error message would be more helpful, but I can understand\nthat this is probably not worth anyone's time.\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
