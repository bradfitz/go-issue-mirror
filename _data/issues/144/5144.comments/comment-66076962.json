It seems so, since otherwise go build and\ngo test complain about multiple packages in the directory.\n\nYes. It's actually codified in cmd/go/test.go +420, and doc.go +343. These fields are\ncan be inspected by go list, \n\n    lucky(~) % go list -f '{{ .TestGoFiles }}' bytes\n    [export_test.go]\n    lucky(~) % go list -f '{{ .XTestGoFiles }}' bytes\n    [buffer_test.go bytes_test.go example_test.go reader_test.go]\n\nBut you are correct that package $PKG_test is special. \n\n\u003e Any other subtleties I should be aware of?\n\nWatch out for the duplication test.go has a description of the command which is part of\nthe go help output, but doc.go has the godoc string, those two need to be kept in sync.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
