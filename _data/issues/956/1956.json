	"body": "by **jdnurmi@qwe.cc**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003e(Not really sure where/if there is an actual bug, but the documentation seems\ninaccurate);\n\nDocumentation\n=============\nfunc (c *Conn) tls.Handshake() os.Error\n\n... ***Most uses of this package need not call Handshake explicitly: the first Read or\nWrite will call it automatically ***\n\n\nOne would then assume an http.ListenAndServeTLS, in accumulating the request, would have\nforced a handshake to occur.\n\nInstead, I've ended up needing to create a custom listener that forces a handshake in\norder to establish PeerCert data in the ConnectionState attribute.\n\nI'm not certain this is wrong from the standpoint of TLS phrasing, but the documentation\ncan lead a developer to be confused.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1.  Create a self-signed cert \u0026amp; key: openssl req -new -x509 -nodes  -subj\n\u0026quot;/CN=localhost\u0026quot; -out host.cert\n2. Compile \u0026amp; run attached sample\n3. curl --insecure \u003ca href=\"https://localhost:8443\"\u003ehttps://localhost:8443\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nHandshake complete\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nHandshake incomplete\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n8g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nlinux\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n53460e066c2f+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI'm not convinced a code-change is needed, but someone who understands why the\ndocumentation seems conflicting would do well to clarify it.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1956/0/tlstest.go\"\u003etlstest.go\u003c/a\u003e (451 bytes)",
