The fact that the test ran the full 60 seconds leads me to believe that the signal isn't being delivered.  The original test was sending a SIGINT and we were seeing similar weirdness with the trybots, and that's not even a signal that the Go signal handler listens for. \r\nI'm not sure what would cause this.",
