	"body": "by **mdriley**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003e307 means \u0026quot;try the same verb on this new URL\u0026quot;.\n\nClient allows callers to define a redirect policy (CheckRedirect) for whether a given\nHTTP redirect should or shouldn't be followed. However, Client.Do() passes an additional\npolicy to doFollowingRedirects() for GET, HEAD, PUT, and POST that is called before\nCheckRedirect. For PUT and POST, that policy only redirects on 302 and 303. Further,\ndoFollowingRedirects() explicitly changes the verb from POST or PUT to GET on redirect.\nAs a result, the API provides no way for callers to follow a 307 redirect and keep the\nverb.\n\nI imagine the code was written not to follow these redirects because the spec for this\ncase says \u0026quot;the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can\nbe confirmed by the user\u0026quot;. The API should allow the CheckRedirect policy to say\nsuch redirects are okay.\n\nwget and curl both support these redirects.\u003c/pre\u003e",
