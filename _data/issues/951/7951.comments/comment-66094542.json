And one nice way to represent such a subset is as an array of bools; see the\nmotivating example above. And to safely use such an array you need it to have the\nappropriate length--big enough to have entries for all token constant values.\n\nI ask because I'm playing with a go vet check for which I have sets of tokens\ncorresponding to binary operations that are commutative, that are associative, etc. I\ncould use a map to represent these instead, but an array is so much cheaper that it was\nthe first thing I reached for.\n\nIt's not a big deal, though. If you'd rather leave it as is, please mark this\nWorkingAsIntended. If I don't hear anything, I'll mail a CL for Go 1.4.\u003c/pre\u003e",
