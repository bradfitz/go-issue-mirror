	"body": "I recently started implementing some interfaces for my structures and I was surprised to find that the default JSON encoder appears to try encoding the interfaces as if they were variables in structures. So for example if we have:\r\n\r\ntype Foo interface{\r\n    FooMe()\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Bar struct {\r\n    Foo\r\n    ImportantVariable string\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe encoded JSON would look like:\r\n{\"Foo\":null,\"ImportantVariable\":\"\"}\r\n\r\nWhich is kind of silly, since Foo will never be anything other than null.\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful for JSON to check if an imported variable is only an interface, not a struct or any other data structure, and ignore it completely if it is.",
