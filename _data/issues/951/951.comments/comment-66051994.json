In the first case, it closed on panic\n(too quickly to respond to) - so there may be a timing / timeout situation involved (why\nit would not repeat w/ time, I'm not sure - it was after once I could hit \"ok\" that\nthings started working;   I'll look into how to dis-allow network access and thus see if\nit is reproducible this way).\u003c/pre\u003e",
