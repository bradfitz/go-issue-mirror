I\ndefinitely noticed a higher chance of HTTPS sites refusing to 'let go' of their\nconnections. When trying to crawl lots of sites, it becomes impossible because workers\nbecome blocked and I can't seem to kill the connection.\n\nThis actually happens a lot when attempting to crawl the Alexa Top 1 million sites, lots\nof sites appear to accept the connection but just hold on to them indefinitely.\u003c/pre\u003e",
