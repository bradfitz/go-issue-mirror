	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eDragonFly BSD is dropping 32-bit x86 support and has turned off their dragonfly-386\nbuilder, saying it hung anyway. From email:\n\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\nFrom: Justin Sherrill\nTo: me, Russ, golang-dev \nThat machine is OK on disk space now.  The go builder was actually not supposed to be\nstarted; the builder process hangs frequently and I don't know if that's a Go issue or\nfrom other activity on that machine.\n\nDragonFly's next release is the last for i386, and I don't think there's anyone in the\nintersection of 32-bit DragonFly and running Go.  I was planning to let it go gently\ninto that good night.\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n\nSo let's drop support for dragonfly-386.\u003c/pre\u003e",
