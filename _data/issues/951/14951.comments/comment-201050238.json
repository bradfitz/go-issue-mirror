Why not go over the heap goal this cycle in that case?\r\n\r\nAt the last GC, assume we had a live set of size L so we set the heap goal to be 2L (for GOGC=100).  Just set the trigger \u0026 assist ratio so that we scan L bytes by the time total allocation is up to 2L.  Then if we reach a total allocation of 2L and scanning still isn't done, then we know the live set is larger than L and we can grow the heap (i.e. miss the heap goal) with a clean conscience.",
