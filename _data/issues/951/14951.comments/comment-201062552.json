	"body": "@randall77, this is basically the idea behind proposal 3. However, it's important to have the more aggressive fallback if the heap is actually growing. In fact, in the original pacer design, I set the assist ratio to target scanning the expected reachable heap (the marked heap from last cycle) by the heap goal and this let aggressive mutators spiral the heap size out of control. I don't remember the exact details of this failure mode, but it may have happened if the system got into a state where the assist ratio was less than 1 (or only slightly larger than 1).",
