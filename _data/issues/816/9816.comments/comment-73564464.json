	"body": "There's a difference between a string value and a string variable. Variables are by definition modifiable, otherwise they wouldn't be called variables. String values are not modifiable and thus immutable. There's nothing unusual here about the use of the term \"immutable\".\r\n\r\nThe spec is sometimes lax when it talks about things X - sometimes we mean the type X, sometimes we mean a value X, sometimes we mean a variable of type X. But usually it's clear from context; being always 100% explicit is overly pedantic and will make the spec unreadable.\r\n\r\nI don't doubt that there's a lot of discussion about the subject, as there's a lot about almost everything. But the notion of immutable strings is non-controversial and exists in many other languages.",
