	"body": "I honestly feel that these arguments over terminology makes things less clear rather than more.  Both threads you cite are confusions about variables: one about variables in data races, one about variables in a range statement.  These exact same confusions arise in practice about int variables, so I see nothing special about strings in those threads.\r\n\r\nI continue to believe that in Go string values are immutable just as int values are immutable.  I continue to believe that this not true in C/C++.  Therefore I continue to believe that it is useful to state clearly in the spec that string values are immutable.  I do not agree that it is equivalent to say that \u0026s[i] is invalid.  The fact that \u0026s[i] is invalid is a technical statement that follows from the general concept that string values are immutable.",
