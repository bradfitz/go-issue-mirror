	"body": "This is a followup-issue for #15114, which added constants for the `Fadvise()` syscall for amd64 and 386 on Linux. I discovered that the constants are also missing for Linux/arm. For all the other architectures they are there, only arm is missing.\r\n\r\nI've tried running `mkall.sh` but this fails:\r\n```\r\n$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm ./mkall.sh\r\ngcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-marm'; did you mean '-mabm'?\r\ngcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-marm'; did you mean '-mabm'?\r\nfork/exec /tmp/go-build154582490/command-line-arguments/_obj/exe/mkpost: exec format error\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs `mkall.sh` supposed to be run on the target architecture?\r\n\r\nI propose adding the constants FADV_* manually to `ztypes_linux_arm.go`, the constants are the same: https://github.com/thorvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/fadvise.h\r\n\r\nWould a CL which adds the constants manually be accepted?\r\n\r\nCould you please advise me how to add the constants for Linux on arm?",
