I wish it was a bit cleaner; https://github.com/joneskoo/http2-keylog/blob/master/h2keylog-client/client.go#L41-L51 captures it better in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer an example with a real-world net/http with http2 which the current PS4 doesn't really do, which I raised in the other issue. I would gladly welcome someone else giving it a try and taking over, continuing on my work. I don't know when I'll be able to work on this next, could be some time.",
