	"body": "I wish for this to be added, it would be so helpful debugging especially HTTP2. It is a trivial code change as demonstrated by [my proof of concept](https://github.com/joneskoo/http2-keylog/blob/master/README.md). Obviously needs refining to bring this into standard library, but you can see that it's hardly any code to implement this.\r\n\r\nI think the biggest question is how to enable this in a Go idiomatic fashion, especially through net/http. NSS uses environment variable SSLKEYLOGFILE for the file where to dump secrets.\r\n\r\nAs I understand the CLIENT_RANDOM based format is sufficient to cover everything, and I don't know if pre-1.8.0 Wireshark would be relevant for HTTP2 anyway.\r\n\r\nI only demonstrated server handshake but client should be identical.",
