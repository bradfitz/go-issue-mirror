And those cases use int64 because they are\ndesigned to transfer a large amount of data in a series of calls; the other functions\nare only called once.  It's easy to make your program work by adding a conversion to\nint64.  (And your program should probably use io.WriteString rather than fmt.Fprint.)\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
