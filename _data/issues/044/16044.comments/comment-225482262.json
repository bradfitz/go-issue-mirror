	"body": "From the error message, it looks like go vet is using an old gcimporter that doesn't know about the new binary export format (the export data of which happens to start in this case with \"cn\" rather than \"package\").\r\n\r\n@aaronbee Can you please verify that you are running the latest version of go vet? Specifically, a version compiled with the 1.7 compiler and using 1.7 libraries? For instance, in the std library dir, you should have a file `src/go/internal/gcimporter/bimport.go` that is up-to-date.\r\n\r\nIf this is all true, try building the std library (make.bash in the src directory) and confirm/deny that the error is still present. Thanks.\r\n",
