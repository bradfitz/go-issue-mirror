Here's the corrected repro code:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/_Hv6qogAHl\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/_Hv6qogAHl\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWith the fixed code, I don't see any incorrect response bodies; however, the\n\"Unsolicited response\" errors still exist.\n\nPlease change the title of this issue to read\n\n\"net/http/httputil: HTTP protocol errors using ReverseProxy\"\n\nor similar.\n\nThanks!\u003c/pre\u003e",
