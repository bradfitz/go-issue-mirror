I think\nthat should make a kernel system call.  I don't think that libgo should modify\nsyscall.Syscall to look for SYS_IOCTL and then adjust the values that it is passed.\n\nIn any case as far as I can see what is changing is not the value passed to ioctl.  It's\nthat the structure is adjusted going in or out, via tcsetattr or tcgetattr.\n\nI think the most straightforward fix for your purposes is for docker to use a \"// +build\ngccgo\" file that calls syscall.Tcgetattr and syscall.Tcsetattr.  Those are available for\ngccgo but not for gc, and they should do the right thing.\n\nWhen the gc compiler works for Power, we will need to make sure that it uses the kernel\ndefinition of termios, not the user space definition.  If we do that, then the existing\ncode should work for gc, using syscall.Syscall(syscall.SYS_IOCTL).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **repo-gccgo**, **release-none**._",
