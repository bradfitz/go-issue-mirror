Works fine with 6g.\nShould i open an issue for that specifically?\n\nNow, WRT the original problem, it's a consequence of my ~/.profile. Specifically, the\nlast command executed is a test for file existence in which it is returning false. That\nappears to affect the status provided to the \"if ... bash ...\" statement in the\ngo/test/run script.\n\nI'm still not clear why returning true from .profile clears up the issue since i can't\nreproduce the same outside of the go/test/run script and nowhere do i ever see $? being\nnon-zero within go/test/run. But adding \"|| true\" in my .profile resolved _this_ issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
