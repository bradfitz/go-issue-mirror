In this case, the content is being contributed by\nthe community and minimal research is required. I'm a big fan of simple, direct, and\ncomplete documentation that is easily found.\n\nIn contrast, Wikis for larger projects may have the information, but because the\ndistributed nature of the Wiki is being enforced, it's difficult to find.\u003c/pre\u003e",
