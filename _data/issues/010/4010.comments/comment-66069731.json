I can give you access to maintain that page on\nthe wiki if you would like, however my intention with this issue is just to solve the\nproblem at hand, the lack of instructions for RHEL/Centos users.\n\nI believe I am speaking for the Go Authors when I say the expected mode of consumption\nfor Go is as an installer or disto bundled package.
