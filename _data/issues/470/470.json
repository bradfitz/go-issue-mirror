	"body": "by **soniakeys**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Two source files, \u003ca href=\"http://pastebin.com/f26179f31\"\u003ehttp://pastebin.com/f26179f31\u003c/a\u003e and\n\u003ca href=\"http://pastebin.com/f557e27bb\"\u003ehttp://pastebin.com/f557e27bb\u003c/a\u003e\n2. compile and link as two separate programs.\n3. run the first one, then the second.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nexpected: 42.\ninstead:\nthrow: runtimeÂ·mapaccess1: key not in map\npanic PC=0x2ad775b949e8\n... (complete output: \u003ca href=\"http://pastebin.com/f47eacf2f)\"\u003ehttp://pastebin.com/f47eacf2f)\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nlinux, amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n16355a0398ab+ tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nPossibly related to \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/459\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/459\u003c/a\u003e, but I\nthink this is a separate issue.\n\nThe problem doesn't reproduce when the two programs are combined into one!\n That is, \u003ca href=\"http://pastebin.com/f724d1c22\"\u003ehttp://pastebin.com/f724d1c22\u003c/a\u003e produces the expected output, 42.\n\nPossibly some state is stored in the program address space that needs to be\nencoded in the gob?  This would allow the one-program version to work but\nwould leave the two program version to make a bad assumption at some point.\u003c/pre\u003e",
