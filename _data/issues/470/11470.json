	"body": "Feature suggestion: There's already the .image mechanism to get a picture up in present. It would be nice to have an image be the backdrop for a slide.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a \"command\" .background which does exactly what .image does, but instead it shows the text on top of it? Then, by sizing an image large enough, it could be the backdrop of a slide.\r\n\r\nI think that could make present a lot more powerful (though appropriate choice of backdrops one could basically get \"themes\", etc. yet still keep the simplicity of use).\r\n\r\nPerhaps there's a way to choose one backdrop for all slides, or for individual slides.",
