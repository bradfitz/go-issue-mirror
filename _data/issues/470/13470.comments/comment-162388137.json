The Docker image uses `2.19-18+deb8u1`, but crash and callsite are the same (though I'm not enough of a `gdb` wizard to peek into `isspace()` - if you don't mind sharing what I need to follow up with your findings, I'd appreciate it).\r\n\r\n[this Dockerfile](https://github.com/tschottdorf/goplay/tree/master/issue_13470/Dockerfile) (run using `docker build -t gdb . \u0026\u0026 docker run -ti gdb`) could be useful for anybody who can't repro locally. It has `gdb` and the sources set up.",
