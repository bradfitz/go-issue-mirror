If you build your program with `go build \"-ldflags=-extldflags=-static -v\"` you should see, along with other debug output, a warning from the C linker.  On my system I see this:\r\n    /home/iant/go/src/net/cgo_unix.go:57: warning: Using 'getaddrinfo' in statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking\r\n\r\nIf there is any discrepancy there--if, for example, you are building on one system and running on a different one--that could be the cause of your problem.",
