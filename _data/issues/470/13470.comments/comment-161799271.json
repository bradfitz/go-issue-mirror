Yes, I see those warnings. Still, segfault with `go run`.\r\n\r\nFWIW, the external linker being used:\r\n```\r\nld --version\r\nGNU ld (GNU Binutils for Debian) 2.25\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\nThis program is free software; you may redistribute it under the terms of\r\nthe GNU General Public License version 3 or (at your option) a later version.\r\nThis program has absolutely no warranty.\r\n```",
