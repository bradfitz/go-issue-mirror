	"body": "The variable is not \"shadowed\". It is reassigned. Escape analysis works on variables. One value assigned to the variable str does indeed escape. The result is therefore correct.\n\nYou might argue a broader point, that we should use a much more sophisticated escape analysis that works on values instead of variables, but I am skeptical that there's much evidence for that.\n\nIn any event when you really care about escape analysis results there is a clear workaround, as you've shown.\n\nIf you did use a shadowed variable that would work too:\n\n\t{\n\t\tstr := string([]byte(str))\n\t\treturn str\n\t}\n\nRuss",
