If n \u0026lt; 1, it does not change the current setting. This\ncall will go away when the scheduler improves.\n\nI would think runtime.GoMaxProcs(n int) int is still more logical, if it doesn't set or\nread the environment variables, then more reason to not ALLCAPS it.\nDoesn't \"func Getwd() (string, Error)\" use an environment variable?\n\nAlso, why does the language even want to make that distinction? What about OS\nportability?\u003c/pre\u003e",
