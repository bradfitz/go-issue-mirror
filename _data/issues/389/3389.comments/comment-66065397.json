The confusing thing was that this doesn't work:\n\n$ rm -rf bin pkg; GOPATH=`pwd` go install -v cmd/bar\ncan't load package: package cmd/bar: open /path/to/go/src/cmd/bar: no such file or\ndirectory\n\nbut this does work:\n\n$ rm -rf bin pkg; GOPATH=`pwd` go install -v cmd/foo/bar\n\nIt's much less confusing when you know that cmd/* is kind of reserved and that cmd/*/*\nis \"less\" reserved.\u003c/pre\u003e",
