	"body": "\u003cpre\u003e(for discussion)\n\nmath/big.*Int has SetInt64 and Int64() functions for setting the value of a *Int and\ngetting its value respectively.\n\nHowever, when interfacing with other code, it would be very useful to have similar\nfunctions for uint64's. SetBits() works on 64-bit systems with unsafe, but that's not a\nvery nice solution.\u003c/pre\u003e",
