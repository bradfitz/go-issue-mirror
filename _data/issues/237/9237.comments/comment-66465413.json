In any case, because there is no return statement, main returns whatever is in register AX when it ends. That turns out to be the return value from printf, the length of \"hello world\", 11.\r\n\r\nWhen you run the program on a Linux terminal you are getting exactly the same behavior, but you are ignoring it. Try:\r\n\r\n$ ./a.out\r\n$ echo $?\r\n\r\nand it will say 11.\r\n\r\n",
