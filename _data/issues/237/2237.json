	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eRight now filepath.Walk will ignore errors by default, but will give the option of\nfeeding them into an errors channel if desired.\n\nAs Philipp Waehnert reported in the ML, though, simply running the walk with a channel\nwill block the running goroutine if the number of errors exceed the channel buffer size,\nunless there's another goroutine reading from the channel.\n\nThen, even if a goroutine is reading from the channel, it's still dangerously tempting\nto break down on the first error and stop reading from the channel, which again would\nlead to problems due to a goroutine blocked in background. That means one can't\ninterrupt a running walk from outside in case of errors.\n\nIn addition to these issues, errors from the visitor logic itself have to be propagated\nthrough a panic, which has to be correctly integrated with the above details.\n\nFeels like too many things to keep in mind for such a simple problem.\u003c/pre\u003e",
