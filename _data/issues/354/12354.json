	"body": "[Giving this a real milestone because it should not be dropped on the floor.]\n\nI'm not sure why golang.org/x/oauth2 exists. It seems like golang.org/x/net/oauth2 would have been appropriate. Too late for that.\n\nEven so, there is no AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS file. They say they refer to the Go project's file. That's fine. But then LICENSE and every source file in the actual code to \"The oauth2 Authors\". That group is not defined (see previous sentence) and also not something we want to maintain separately. The copyrights should be changed to say \"The Go Authors\", like all our other subrepos.",
