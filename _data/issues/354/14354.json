	"body": "Commit 4a0ba7a allowed golang to use its own dns resolver instead of libc in a number of cases. The code parses nsswitch.conf and attempts to resolve things in the same order. Unfortunately, builds with netgo completely ignore this parsing and always search via hostLookupFilesDNS. It seems like it would be better to parse the file and only fallback to hostLookupFilesDNS if it would normally use hostLookupCgo.\r\n\r\nI noticed this because I have a static binary built with cgo, and it is using files for lookup even when nsswitch.conf specifies:\r\n\r\n    hosts:      dns",
