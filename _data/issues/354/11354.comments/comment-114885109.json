	"body": "Yes, this is definitely a bug in 1.4.  Some types come out of the compiler with a nonzero size but a zero alignment.  At least one of the culprits was the types used for map buckets, they were assigned a width but no alignment as map buckets don't need alignment info.  But somehow those types are getting shared with other types that do need alignment info.  This is why [8]X triggers the bug but not [7]X or [9]X.\r\n\r\nThis is fixed in 1.5 because we use dowidth() on the map types to compute their size (Dmitry made this change for other reasons, if I remember correctly).\r\n\r\nI'm going to add a check to 1.5 to make sure it really is fixed and stays fixed.",
