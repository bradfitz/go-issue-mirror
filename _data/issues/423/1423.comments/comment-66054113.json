They are not handled the same way as file systems paths.\n\nThe reason I want to use '\\' is because, *again*, even though the Win32 API supports\nthem, they are not handled correctly by most applications.\n\nIf I need to generate pathnames that are given to other Windows applications I need to\ncode them by hand, losing the benefit to use the path package.\n\nPlus if I need to handle UNC paths, I am also required to generate the paths without\nhelp from the path package.\n\nI really don't understand why Go does not follow what every programming language on\nWIndows offers and what Microsoft's own documentation suggests.\n\nBut maybe Windows is not that important anyhow...\u003c/pre\u003e",
