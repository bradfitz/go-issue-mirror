What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\ndarwin/amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nUsing package \"unsafe\", I noticed Sizeof, Alignmentof, and Offsetof do not abide by the CamelCase format.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nunsafe.SizeOf\r\nunsafe.AlignmentOf\r\nunsafe.OffsetOf\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nunsafe.Sizeof\r\nunsafe.Alignmentof\r\nunsafe.Offsetof\r\n\r\nNote: Is the lack of CamelCaps intentional to provide similarity to the C 'sizeof' operator?",
