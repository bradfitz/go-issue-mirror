But that's not necessarily the case if the code consuming the var is a library.\n\nIn our (admittedly uncommon) case, what we have is a library that initializes one of its\npackages vars from the environment, and then wants to clear it. The application using\nthe library may or may not ever do the exec, but our library has no input into this.\nWhat we do now is set it to \"\", but then the env key leaks to the child processes. We\ncould clear the env and repopulate it in our library, but then other code looking at the\nenvironment at the same time might see the partially reconstructed environment.\u003c/pre\u003e",
