Any addition to the std library would need to be supported with data showing that it'd help a large number of programs, including the standard library itself, and lead to more legible programs.\r\n\r\nBut I do think there are a number of funcs in various places in the standard library that would use something like a `strings.First(...string) string` call, so you could go search and get some data.\r\n\r\nHere are at least two:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbradfitz@laptop go$ git grep -A 5 \"func valueOrDefault\"\r\nsrc/net/http/httputil/dump.go:func valueOrDefault(value, def string) string {\r\nsrc/net/http/httputil/dump.go-  if value != \"\" {\r\nsrc/net/http/httputil/dump.go-          return value\r\nsrc/net/http/httputil/dump.go-  }\r\nsrc/net/http/httputil/dump.go-  return def\r\nsrc/net/http/httputil/dump.go-}\r\n--\r\nsrc/net/http/request.go:func valueOrDefault(value, def string) string {\r\nsrc/net/http/request.go-        if value != \"\" {\r\nsrc/net/http/request.go-                return value\r\nsrc/net/http/request.go-        }\r\nsrc/net/http/request.go-        return def\r\nsrc/net/http/request.go-}\r\n```\r\n",
