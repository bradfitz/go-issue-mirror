	"body": "The current documentation does mention that; however, it could have been more clear.\r\n\r\n`log.Printf` says:\r\n\r\n\u003e     Printf calls Output to print to the standard logger. Arguments are handled\r\n\u003e     in the manner of fmt.Printf.\r\n\r\nand `log.Output` says:\r\n\r\n\u003e     Output writes the output for a logging event. The string s contains the text\r\n\u003e     to print after the prefix specified by the flags of the Logger. A newline is\r\n\u003e     appended if the last character of s is not already a newline. Calldepth is\r\n\u003e     the count of the number of frames to skip when computing the file name and\r\n\u003e     line number if Llongfile or Lshortfile is set; a value of 1 will print the\r\n\u003e     details for the caller of Output.\r\n\r\nMaybe `analogous to Printf` could use `log.Printf` instead of `Printf` thereby avoiding confusion with `fmt.Printf`.\r\n",
