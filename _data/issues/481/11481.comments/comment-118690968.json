Are you saying it fixes your problem at current tip on your builder?\r\n\r\n\u003e However in both cases they cause the current exception handler to work and cause the _AddVectoredContinueHandler to stop working.\r\n\r\nI noticed that too while debugging. I don't have explanation for that.\r\n\r\n\u003e ... Has the go team published guidelines for interacting with cgo memory, especially in windows? I've heard talk of that but haven't seen anything, and I lack the understanding to derive it unfortunately.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what you're after. Generally if outside code uses Go memory, Go runtime needs to be aware of that. And it is not \"cgo memory\" - we don't use cgo here - function names in runtime have cgo names because windows uses some similar procedures to cgo. If you have some particular questions, I will try and answer.\r\n\r\nHere https://go-review.googlesource.com/11888 is my proposal. Let me know if it fixes build on your builder.\r\n\r\nAlex",
