	"body": "@alexbrainman If I modify syscall_getprocaddress I can get it to pass again. Still not a root cause. However if \"c\" is of type libcall and not *libcall in syscall_getprocaddress then it passes. So:\r\n```\r\nfunc syscall_getprocaddress(...) {\r\n\t// passes\r\n\tc := getg().m.syscall\r\n\t...\r\n\tcgocall(asmstdcallAddr, unsafe.Pointer(\u0026c))\r\n\r\n\r\n\t// fails\r\n\tc := \u0026getg().m.syscall\r\n\t...\r\n\tcgocall(asmstdcallAddr, unsafe.Pointer(c))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can understand more from here. Continuing to post progress, as time for this is intermittent.\r\n-Daniel\r\n",
