That behaved exactly the\nsame way.\n\nThe documentation says \nSscanf, Fscanf and Sscanf require newlines in the input to match newlines in the format;\nthe other routines treat newlines as spaces. \n\n(I assume you mean Scanf,Fscanf and Sscanf ( not Sscanf twice))\n\nBut this is not so. They happily accept a space instead of a newline. Give it a space or\nnewline in the format it will happily swallow all spaces or newlines. And the next\nfollowing character. Which will disappear if not buffered.\n\nSo now I have two more issues. One documentation typo + one implementation issue.\nFor the problem I started with I think should be solved by no being so hungry when the\nformat ends in space.\u003c/pre\u003e",
