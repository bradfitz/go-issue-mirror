The patch does not always send flow control, it separates sending connection-level flow control and stream level: \r\nwhen a data frame is received, send connection-level flow control of len(data)\r\nwhen data is read by handler, send stream-level flow control of len(data)\r\n\r\nThat being said, I am not trying to propose a fix, just trying to provide more info to help find the issue.",
