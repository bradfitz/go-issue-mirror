If that were done, clients could repeatedly open new streams (which start with a default flow control) and write an unbounded amount.\r\n\r\nI think we need to verify buffered flow control (from server-read but handler-unread bytes) is always returned on stream close, or when writing to a stream not accepting data.\r\n\r\nI've been traveling the past 20 hours (to an HTTP workshop, as it happens) so I'll look at this after I've had some sleep and get a free moment.\r\n\r\nIf you or somebody else wants to write stand-alone repro unit tests in the x/net/http2 style, using its existing test framework, that would be helpful.",
