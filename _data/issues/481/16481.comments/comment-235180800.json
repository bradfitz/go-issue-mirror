	"body": "Thanks for the update and for finding the issue #16498. After fixing these issues, it would be nice to test the fair share of bandwidth both ways. For example, with a fix rate connection, open one stream, verify it utilizes all the bandwidth, then open another stream, each should use 1/2. Then keep 2 steams open and stop transferring on one steam, the other one should use the full bandwidth again. Then open more steams and so on so forth. Also verify no steam blocks the connection level frames. SSH implements streams with flow control, which could be referenced. ",
