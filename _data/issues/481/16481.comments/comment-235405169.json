For example, if the\r\nsender sends large chunk of data and use up all connection level flow quota, but the\r\nreceiver's handler never reads the data, the data will be buffered, but\r\nthe current implementation would not send windows update and thus the\r\nwhole connection is blocked\r\n\r\nNo, with the CL I sent out, that's exactly one of the cases that's tested and fixed.\r\n\r\nIf you have a test program to demonstrate otherwise I'd be interested.\r\n\r\n\u003e In this case, the data did arrive to the server and the connection is wide open, it should not block other steams.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you mean by this. HTTP/2 defines both connection-level and stream-level flow control, and rules for each. Incoming DATA frame bytes deduct against both. What do you think we're doing wrong specifically?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
