It is a distraction every time I switch from editor to browser and reload, particularly when it covers text and/or the Run button.\r\n\r\nCan we do one of these:\r\n\r\n* Disable it when on localhost/127.0.0.1\r\n* Use local storage and/or cookies to only display it once per browser\r\n* Accept a flag to present to disable it (which would have to be passed on to the javascript somehow)\r\n\r\n// cc @adg \r\n",
