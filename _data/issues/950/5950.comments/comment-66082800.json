I can't just use net/http's Request.Write\n(because it'll emit these headers), but the implementation of Request.Write relies on a\ngood deal of unexported net/http, which means borrowing it will be non-trivial.\n\nI suppose I could do something ugly like inspect and modify the output of Request.Write,\nbut that feels ugly and fragile.\n\nIt is definitely a minor issue, but it seems reasonable for other auto-added headers to\nbehave like the Date header in this regard. Evidence that the Date header behavior is\nright is that I didn't consult documentation -- I just tried it, and it worked exactly\nas I expected.\n\nFiled issue \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/5953\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/5953\u003c/a\u003e about the double\nContent-Type headers.\u003c/pre\u003e",
