	"body": "by **A.T.Sheehan**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhen running goinstall to download the SDL package I get the following error: \n\ngoinstall github.com/banthar/Go-SDL\ngoinstall: github.com/banthar/Go-SDL: package has no files\n\nI checked and the files have been downloaded to\n$GOROOT/src/pkg/github.com/banthar/Go-SDL but haven't been compiled.\n\nThe problem seems to be when there are no *.go files in the package's root directory. In\n$GOROOT/src/cmd/goinstall/parse.go, the goFiles function does not look in any\nsubdirectories for *.go files. Since the SDL package has no *.go files in the root, it\nreturns with 0 files and the installation stops there.\n\nI'm not sure if there are specific guidelines for creating packages where there\nshouldn't be any subdirectories with code, in which case the SDL package needs to be\nadjusted, or if goinstall needs to be updated.\n\n\n\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\u003c/pre\u003e",
