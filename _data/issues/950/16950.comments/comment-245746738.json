	"body": "Thanks @wheelcomplex, that's very helpful.\r\n\r\nI'm rather perplexed, though. The compiler binary shouldn't be using more than a handful of LDT entries. In your gdb7 backtrace, the binary was setting up it's *very first* user LDT entry. The only way I could see this happening is if `exec` failed to clear the LDT for the new image, but `exec_setregs` resets the LDT back to the default LDT first thing.\r\n\r\nSince you're annotating your kernel anyway, could you see what path the failing binary is taking through `i386_set_ldt`? Does it allocate a new LDT? What is mdp-\u003emd_ldt-\u003eldt_len on entry (if mdp-\u003emd_ldt != NULL)? How many times does it try to find a free slot?",
