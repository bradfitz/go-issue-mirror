What's really happening is that the i386_set_ldt syscall is failing (and the runtime triggers a breakpoint signal since it can't recover from this failure; perhaps it should print a message first). I haven't figured out why i386_set_ldt would be failing, though. This could happen if we passed a malformed descriptor, but there's really nothing interesting about the descriptor we pass. Or it could happen if we're out of LDT slots, but there are 8,192 LDT slots (minus a few for the OS). We do use a slot for each OS thread we create, but the compiler shouldn't be creating more than a handful of threads.\r\n\r\n@wheelcomplex, could you do a few more things in GDB for me? I can't read your core file at the moment because gomote is acting up (and my Linux box doesn't know what to do with a FreeBSD core). I'd like to know the output of `info threads`, `print 'runtime.sched'.mcount`, `info registers`, and `x/32wx $sp`.",
