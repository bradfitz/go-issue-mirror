Can you get a trace of the failing call under strace -f?\nIt looks like MkdirAll checked, could not confirm that /mtpt/subdir was an existing\ndirectory (perhaps due to error, but that's okay), called itself recursively to work on\n/mtpt, and then that call returned an error. That error seems to be 'file exists'. So it\nseems to have nothing to do with /mtpt/subdir and only with /mtpt. Is /mtpt a directory?\nDoes stat of /mtpt work?\n\nIt seems like Stat(\"/mtpt\") is returning an error but Mkdir(\"/mtpt\") is returning\nEEXIST. Can you explain how that happens?\u003c/pre\u003e",
