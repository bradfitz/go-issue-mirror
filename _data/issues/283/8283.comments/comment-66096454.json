The Stat is irrelevant.\n\nThe only way I can make sense of what you are saying is if\nStat(\"/failed-file-system-mount-point\") also fails, presumably with EIO.  It is only\nafter that that the code would try Mkdir(\"/failed-file-system-mount-point\") which I\nassume is failing with EEXIST.  At that point the code will call\nLstat(\"/failed-file-system-mount-point\"), which I guess must *also* be failing with EIO.\n You seem to be suggesting that it should instead try\nMkdir(\"/failed-file-system-mount-point/subdirectory-to-create\") which I guess would fail\nwith the EIO you want to see.\n\nIt's hard for me to get worked about a case where Stat(filename) fails with EIO but\nMkdir(filename) fails with EEXIST.  Why doesn't the Mkdir fail with EIO also?\u003c/pre\u003e",
