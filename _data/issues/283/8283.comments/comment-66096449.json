It never checks to see what the\nerror is, only that the error is not null.\n\nSo if Stat() is returning some other error, like \"intput/output error\" in my case,\ninstead of returning the error to the caller it proceeds with business as usual.\n\nOn line 29 we have the commented assumption \"// Doesn't already exist; make sure parent\ndoes.\" This assumption is wrong. The code never checked that the directory doesn't\nexist, only whether or not Stat() on it generates an error.\u003c/pre\u003e",
