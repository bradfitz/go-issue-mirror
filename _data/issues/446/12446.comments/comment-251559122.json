That is to say, I don't think we should change the go tool as this will enable people to continue to do the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nTo accurately benchmark you should have a before and after sample and run those both several times back to back to rule out thermal variation. This is what the -c flag gives you, a binary that you can run with whatever timeout and count flags you need on dedicated benchmarking hardware. \r\n\r\nWorking around this inside go test encourages people to benchmark on shared cloud Ci hardware, which is inaccurate.
