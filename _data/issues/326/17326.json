	"body": "In #16333 a user reported that they were unable to vendor code which the Go standard library itself vendored.\r\n\r\nTo \"fix\" the problem for the 1.7 release, we renamed the \"$GOROOT/src/vendor/golang.org\" directory to \"golang_org\" with an underscore, so it wouldn't conflict with users.\r\n\r\nThis is slightly annoying for us to maintain in the stdlib.\r\n\r\nWe should probably fix it properly in `go/build` and/or `cmd/go`.\r\n\r\n/cc @ianlancetaylor @rsc \r\n",
