	"body": "I am a bit worried about deferring to math/big on this. For example, the value should not become +Inf, since that does not mean anything inside the compiler. More generally, math/big's job is to do what is asked, and the compiler has the added requirement of not running forever. The two are different, so it makes sense for the compiler to have some checks of its own. I will send a CL rejecting numbers with too many exponent digits. That should defend against a whole class of problems.\r\n\r\n",
