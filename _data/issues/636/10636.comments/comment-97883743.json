The finalizer is invoked, but Destroy doesn't destroy the context since it is still in use. The Open AL specification says it's illegal to call alcDestroyContext if the given context is current. So, the Linux implementation seems to be buggy for destroying the current context.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it became clear that the Context finalizer should do some additional job to set the current context to NULL, otherwise the current context is not destroyed on some platforms and we leak.",
