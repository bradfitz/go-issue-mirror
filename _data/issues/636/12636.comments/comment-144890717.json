	"body": "Absolutely.\r\n\r\nWe had to tweak our `$GOPATH` in the following ways:\r\n* *pre*pend the `godep` path to original `$GOPATH` in order to capture internally version-locked installations of dependencies by `godep` so there would not be conflicts between those and other installations in the external `$GOPATH`\r\n* add the output of our compilation to the `$GOPATH` - we invoke `go tool vet` per-file, and while most things that depended on definitions outside of the immediate package worked, some were missed by not explicitly including the compiled packages in `$GOPATH`\r\n\r\nSome oddities that we were not able to find the reason for but nevertheless do not seem to be issues anymore were the `printf` warnings that were found on some machines but not others - counting the number of arguments to `fmt.Errorf` doesn't require package imports, so we're not clear as to why there were differences in output but again they do not seem to be present any longer. \r\n\r\nThe total number of `vet` errors we see with the current `HEAD` remains low compared to that which we see using the version of `go vet` that shipped with `go1.4.2`, and I'm still investigating that.",
