	"body": "@ianlancetaylor I am looking right now for you guys to tell me what factors affect the operation of `go vet` so I can isolate this better. Right now I have isolated: `go` version, `go vet` version, exact execution (commands are the same from bash). \r\n\r\nInstance, the invocation:\r\n```sh\r\n$ go tool vet -shadow=false pkg/cmd/experimental/diagnostics/client.go\r\n```\r\nFrom our repository root (referencing [client.go](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/pkg/cmd/experimental/diagnostics/client.go) as linked above) returns no errors on my machine, but on some others it returns the unkeyed struct literal issue on line 37.\r\n\r\nThis file is 46 lines long and, while it does take some context from other files, it is the best I can do right now. Please let me know how I can make that example better for you guys. I have not been able to write a small file and get the same result, and I understand that makes it difficult because the issue with building the tree may result from having the definition of that struct in some specific file or configuration, but I do not know how to isolate that.",
