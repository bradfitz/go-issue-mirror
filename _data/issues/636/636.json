Thanks.\n\nDid this; problem still exists.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Compile and run the attached go program (starts a bunch of goroutines\nthat try to open a bunch of TCP connections).\n2.\n3.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThere should be no output. Instead, I see the results in the attached .txt\nfile (somewhat truncated, but it's 11M unzipped).\n\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nLinux, amd64\n\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n88d305c3f261 tip\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nFeel free to contact me if you need more information. I think the provided\n.go source is a fairly minimal test (I *think* it only occurs from\ngoroutines, and only with a fairly large number of attempts to bogus,\nnon-localhost ports). I could be wrong, though.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/636/0/test.go\"\u003etest.go\u003c/a\u003e (293 bytes)\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/636/0/a.txt.gz\"\u003ea.txt.gz\u003c/a\u003e (179450 bytes)",
