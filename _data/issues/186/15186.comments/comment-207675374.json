	"body": "EIO usually indicates an error of \"size mismatched\" or \"unaligned access\" to the kernel. I'm not sure why the test uses vm.max_kernel_address. Because vm usually consists of ton of machine-dependent stuff. Also freebsd-386-gce101 is actually a complicated \"freebsd-386 on freebsd-amd64\" host. It depends on the implementation whether the value is returned from 32-bit kernel part or 64-bit kernel part. It would be better to use more appropriate syscall entry in testing.\r\n\r\nAlso s/TestSysctUint64/TestSysctlUint64",
