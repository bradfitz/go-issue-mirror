	"body": "Going by BenchmarkCgoCall in misc/cgo/test, on my linux/amd64 system, current tip is about twice as fast as go 1.7. Go 1.7, 1.6 and 1.5 are all about the same and Go 1.4 is slightly slower (I lack the energy to get 1.3 cgo working on this system). So the thing the bug specifically complains about (\"decrease of cgocall performance\") is probably fixed, but is this fast enough? (It's always hard to know when a bug like this can be closed).",
