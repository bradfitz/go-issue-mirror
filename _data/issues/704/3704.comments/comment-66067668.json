It could return an error but there's nothing\nto do if the error occurs because nothing is sent, and that will violate the wire\nprotocol.\n\nConsider this code:\n\nenc.Encode(x)\nenc.Encode(y)\n\nYou should always check errors, of course, and something else could go wrong, but it's\nreasonable to consider that in a working, debugged program this transmission can always\nbe decoded by doing, on the remote side,\n\ndec.Decode(\u0026x)\ndec.Decode(\u0026y)\n\nThe thing is, if x and y are both of type *T, no message will be sent for that pointer,\nand the value of y will be decoded into x.\n\nIn short, attempting to send a top-level nil is a pretty serious violation of the\nstreaming protocol. Of course, it's trivial to return an error and expect the user to\ncheck for error, and I could be talked into that, but I want to be clear that you cannot\nsend a top-level nil ever. The gob package is not at fault here; the client is\nmisbehaving.\u003c/pre\u003e",
