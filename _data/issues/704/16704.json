	"title": "CIDR notation in no_proxy env variable for net/http client",
	"body": "Feature request - It would be helpful if the net/http client supported CIDR notation in the no_proxy environment variable, or allowed another way to configure the net/http client to ignore the http_proxy for large networks (ie 10.0.0.0/8 etc).\r\n\r\nI had no luck finding an official \"spec\" for the no_proxy environment variable, but I believe supporting this notation would cause no issues and would allow users of net/http to add proxy exclusions for large networks.\r\n\r\nPython requests library implements this feature with the no_proxy env variable - https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/utils.py#L569\r\nand most browsers allow some sort of CIDR notation / wildcards for proxy exclusions. \r\n\r\nDuring my searching, I came across an old issue https://github.com/golang/go/issues/2158 where the functionality was discussed but not really addressed (as far as the CIDR notation goes)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.6.3 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOHOSTOS=\"linux\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nTried to use CIDR notation in the no_proxy env variable to exclude net/http client from using web proxy specified in http_proxy env variable for private network 10.0.0.0/8\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nExpected http client library to ignore http_proxy for addresses in the 10.0.0.0/8 network. \r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nnet/http client tried to use the http_proxy for get/post requests to addresses in 10.0.0.0/8 network.\r\n\r\nCheers, and thanks for golang!\r\n\r\n",
