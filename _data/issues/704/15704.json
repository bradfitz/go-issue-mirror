	"body": "stringer concatenates strings (see https://github.com/golang/tools/commit/22ede605a76fe5957178d9b6290c986ae066316d). The original motivation was to shrink the resulting binary. Thanks for work by @crawshaw and @rsc during the Go 1.7 cycle, there is no longer a penalty for having multiple smaller strings. The non-concatenated strings are more readable, so we might want to go back to multiple smaller strings.\r\n\r\nLow priority.\r\n",
