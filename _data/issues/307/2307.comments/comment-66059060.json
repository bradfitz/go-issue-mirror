By default, after you close a socket, it enters a TIME_WAIT state when no\nsocket can use the same pair of address \u0026 port for two minutes.  This is designed to\npermit any trailing packets on the connection to get dropped.  SO_REUSEADDR disables\nthat wait, permitting the connection to be reestablished immediately.  It is normal to\nuse SO_REUSEADDR on a server.\n\nSo this has nothing to do with SO_REUSEADDR.  It does sound Windows-specific.  I can't\nimagine what it would mean to open multiple sockets listening on the same IP address and\nport.  Perhaps Windows defines that in some way.\u003c/pre\u003e",
