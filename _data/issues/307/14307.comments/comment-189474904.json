	"body": "@bradfitz Thanks for the link.\r\n\r\nI wrote a CL that adds an extra field to the struct InternalBenchmark to pass the information (a \"failed bool\" field). It does pass the API check in all.bash, and seems \"acceptable\" from reading https://golang.org/doc/go1compat document, and the Internal in the name makes me thing is not widely used. On the other hand it doesn't pass the criteria from the post you've linked. So I'm a bit unsure whether is OK or not.\r\n\r\nPushed the CL in https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/19889/.",
