It is a misunderstanding of what is happening when\nGOMAXPROCS is raised.\n\nIn the default configuration the draining of the work queue, ie the number of goroutines\nto execute the command is interleaved with the addition of work to the queue.\n\nWhen GOMAXPROCS is raised the main function can continue to add work to the queue, ie\nspawn more goroutines without the scheduling stopping to drain the work to be done.\n\nI do not think this is a bug.\n\nThe second part, the crash on freebsd is an issue. I cannot reproduce the problem on\nlinux, my system runs out of file descriptors.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
