	"body": "The fix for 1.6 is to split the text sections.  Based on the previous comments this part is not considered risky?\r\nThe fix for 1.7 is to split the text sections and handle the address offset mappings that were introduced in 1.7 for the case where the text section was split.  If the text section was not split, the behavior should not be affected.  If you have suggestions to the CL on how to make this less risky and/or more ppc64 specific, then I can change it so it can be considered for 1.7.1.\r\n\r\nAnother possible fix is to generate multiple .o files, such as go1.o, go2.o, etc. instead of one huge go.o with a single large text section.  I don't know if that is feasible or how it would be done.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, I've been asked why this error doesn't also happen on ARM64 since they have a similar bl instruction.  I don't know ARM64 well so I don't know the answer, either they have an alternative way to make the long call or they just haven't hit it yet.  Is there someone who would know the answer to this question?",
