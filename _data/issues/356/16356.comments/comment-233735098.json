My understanding was that Kubernetes only wanted official golang versions for their CI builds so we will have to discuss with them whether they will accept a patched version.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't affect Docker but one of the binaries built during the Kubernetes CI build.\r\n\r\nIf a fix for go 1.6.4 is not possible then this can be closed.  Thanks for the discussion.",
