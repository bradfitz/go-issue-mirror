Subsequent runs even at the same point\nin the main repo's hg history will produce godocs from tip.\n\nbindist should do the same thing (or use the same code) as src/cmd/api/run.go.  Note\nthat it has:\n\n// goToolsVersion is the hg revision of the go.tools subrepo we need\n// to build cmd/api.  This only needs to be updated whenever a go/types\n// bug fix is needed by the cmd/api tool.\nconst goToolsVersion = \"6698ca2900e2\"\n\nSimilarly, we should bake in the go.tools hg revision we're referring to and cloning\nwhen shipping godoc, vet, and cover in binary distributions.\u003c/pre\u003e",
