	"body": "by **jakans@earthlink.net**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. cd to pngbug directory, issue ./build command to build pngbug executable\n2.run pngbug executable with default arguments (reads worldbyx.txt input file)\n3. open default output file (borders.png) to see black band at bottom of PNG image\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\n  map of country boundaries\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\n  map of country boundaries with black artifact band at bottom\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n  6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\n  Mac OS 10.6.6\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n\n  867d37fb41a4 tip\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\npngbug -y 625 (cutting off top of world map) creates partial black band at bottom.  -y\n600 leaves full artifact, -y 650 results in no band, changes to -r, -g, -b from default\n127 eliminates band, as does -a of value other than default 255.  Could this be a bug in\nPNG compression?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/1472/0/pngbug.zip\"\u003epngbug.zip\u003c/a\u003e (673242 bytes)",
