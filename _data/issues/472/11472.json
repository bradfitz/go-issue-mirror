	"body": "One of the most common sources of failure to autoclose issues is contributors writing `Fixes issue #1234` instead of `Fixes #1234`, possibly due to ingrained Rietveld habits. It would be nice if GitHub recognized that phrase, but in the meantime, it'd be very easy to automatically detect and correct.\r\n",
