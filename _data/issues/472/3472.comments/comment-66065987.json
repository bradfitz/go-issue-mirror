I\nfor one lost some time into it ;)\nThe doc says:\n\n\"If _some_ data is available but not len(p) bytes, Read conventionally returns what is\navailable instead of waiting for more.\"\n\nIt could make someone think that if _no_ data is available, Read just wait until it can\nreturn either some bytes or an error (I know it's not saying this, but it's easy to take\nlike this).\n\nI think it's safe to use fmt.ReadFull() for reading to a one-byte slice without checking\nthe count:\n\n_, err = r.reader.Read(r.pendBuf[0:1])  //wrong\n\n_, err = fmt.ReadFull(r.reader, r.pendBuf[0:1])  //ok\u003c/pre\u003e",
