	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThis issue is a proposal that we create a new \u0026quot;go.release\u0026quot; sub-repo and put\nmakerelease and associated files there.\n\nRationale:\n\nThe makerelease tool reads in various files from misc/makerelease during execution.\nBecause the makerelease tool is inside the Go repository it is entwined with our release\nprocess. Changes are usually made to makerelease around release time, and it's not\nalways clear whether the changes should be made to the main or release branches. This\nambiguity would be resolved entirely by keeping the makerelease tool entirely separate\nto the go repository.\n\nAny objections?\u003c/pre\u003e",
