	"body": "by **runningwild**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Get a UDPConn with net.ListenUDP\n2. Set the timeout to something like 1000000ns or more\n3. Keep calling UDPConn.ReadFrom and eventually it will hang\n\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nIt should break every time with the expected os.EAGAIN (currently it is a different\nerror, this is \nmentioned in another bug)\nInstead, sometimes, it hangs, and it seems fairly random when it will hang.  Also when I \ndecrease the timeout to 1ns I haven't seen it hang.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\ndarwin, amd64\n\nWhich revision are you using?
