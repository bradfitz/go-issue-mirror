	"body": "Since floating-point literals are always rational and the only constant expression operators on floating-points (+, -, *, and /) are closed over the rationals, instead of representing floating point constants as just `Sign * Mantissa256 * 10^Exponent32`, could we represent them as `Sign * MantissaQuotient256 / MantissaDivisor256 * 10^Exponent32`?  (I.e., instead of 256-bit integer + floating-point radix, use 512-bit rational + floating-point radix.)\r\n\r\nThere would still be cases where values are inexactly represented, but at least expressions like `1400*(1/3.0) - 1400/3.0` would be exactly computable.",
