In HTTP/1 any case is allowed, and they should be compared case-insensitively.\r\n\r\nGo tries to map things into their Go-canonical form via https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#CanonicalHeaderKey but because it has an underscore in it, Go does nothing (but fixed in Go 1.7).\r\n\r\nI'd recommend using a hyphen instead of an underscore if possible. Otherwise you'll have to enumerate over the map keys looking for the \"UpDaTE_api_KEY\" yourself, normalizing the case of the keys as you look.\r\n",
