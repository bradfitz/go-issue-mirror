See [this test](https://github.com/alexcesaro/qpbench/blob/master/qpbench_test.go#L28).\r\nCurrently is the output of the [current code](http://tip.golang.org/src/mime/quotedprintable/reader.go?#L74) and [mime/qp](https://github.com/alexcesaro/qp/blob/master/qp.go#L107) is the output of a slightly different algorithm I had done. The code is longer but is a bit faster:\r\n````\r\nCurrentDecode      100000         19591 ns/op        4273 B/op           4 allocs/op\r\nNewDecode          100000         15850 ns/op        4289 B/op           4 allocs/op\r\n````\r\n\r\nDo you think that is worth doing another CL on the reader?",
