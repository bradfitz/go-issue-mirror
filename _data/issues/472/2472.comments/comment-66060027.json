It is indeed titled\nas \"MIME Sniffing\", and could be applied to any content. It really is heavily geared\ntowards HTTP (see all the \"HTTP\" references, as well as the security model).\n\nI can't see the general utility of this code beyond where it is, though. As Russ says,\nthis is not a file(1) replacement, and I doubt it will ever be. It might not be in a\nperfect place right now, but it's arguably close enough.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-low**, removed **priority-medium**._",
