I \nthink using word \"Go\" as a name of programming language is not at all immoral (even \nthere is already a programming language called \"Go!\"). We must understand one thing \nthat as a big boss (having many responsibilities on your shoulders ) you can't \nsatisfy everybody, i.e. Google can't. About \"Not being evil\" tag, Google is already \nserving at their best and doing the right things. But of course as a company profit \nshould be first. There are many programming languages exist, as a senior programmer \nyou must know that every programming language has its purpose, it is built for a \nparticular objective, no different case with \"Google Go\".\n\nI support \"Google Go\"!\u003c/pre\u003e",
