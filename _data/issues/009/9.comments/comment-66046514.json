While I appreciate the use of\nhumor and catchy phrases as much as the next person, perhaps it's time to take a key\nfrom other areas of standardization and get a governing body that takes care of a\nnamespace and assigns formal names to the languages from there. Sort of like everyone\nknows Firewire but also IEEE 1394. So each of these \"Go\" languages would have a ILS\n(International Language Standard) ID, and then the \"branding\" would be separate. I'd\nbe happy to form such a committee if Google et al would be willing to use it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
