And I agree that Google should have checked better. Also, in the case\nof Go!, prior to #\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/9\"\u003eissue #9\u003c/a\u003e, finding Go! even with google search might have been very\ndifficult. I find google more at fault on this issue for allowing a publically\nreleased project to have such a short common name that is highly prone to collisions.\n\n@coolboygreatone, you are correct, this discussion is silly....\u003c/pre\u003e",
