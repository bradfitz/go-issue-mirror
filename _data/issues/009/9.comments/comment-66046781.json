WTF?  I \nmean, really, WTF?   That's in the TOP 50 MOST COMMON WORDS IN ENGLISH!!! [1].    At\nleast the guy who \nstarted this thread had the sense to call his language the search friendly \"Go!\"  \n\nThey are totally on crack with this one.   I just can't believe they named a new\nlanguage \"Go\".   I thought java, \nruby, python, groovy, and C were difficult to create unique searches for, but \"Go\"\nbrings this insanity to a \nwhole new level.   \n\nAnd not only is it a common word, it's already heavily overloaded.  Go the common verb? \nGO as in Gene \nOntology?  The popular Asian board game?   Why not call it \"A\" or \"the\" or \"and\" and\nmake us spend ALL of our \ntime trying to get decent search hits?   What a way to show contempt for everyone who\nwill ever use your \nlanguage.   Please change it now, while you can.    It might be slightly embarrassing to\nchange it now, but \npeople are going to be jeering you about this unsearchable name for all time if you\ndon't.
