The \nonly reason Google has to change the name is politeness.\n\nMore distinct names are more complex and less likely to capture mind space. Go has so \nmuch elegant simplicity than any proposed name choice I've seen above, it fits with \nmy understanding of Google attitudes/ethos and the language objectives of minimising \ntyping (except in the increase of types of Go language:).\n\nI say stick to go. People are right, the other Go! will probably benefit from all the \naccidental exposure it gets, he might even sell some copies of his book on the back \nof it!\u003c/pre\u003e",
