If we accept C and C# as \ndifferent languages, then why not Go and Go! as well?\n\nAnyway, my idea is that Google shouldn't change the name and Mr. McCabe should be \nthankful for the *gratis* indirect publicity he got from the whole issue. Hell, I'm \neven considering buying his book now out of curiosity.\n\nIf nothing else works, then change the name to \"GOlang\" and forget about it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
