Google is not going to change the name.\nThey've already invested too much time and money for their developers wages into it.\nEven to create and maintain this issue list. A PAID developer at Google!!!!\n\nIn addition, I think its clear they are under no legal obligation to do so.\n\nTo Mr McCabe: you win some, you lose some.
