The description is of \n\n\"A group of systems for building network-oriented intelligent agents, consisting an\nagent communications infrastructure, April - an agent construction programming\nlanguage, Go! - a logic programming language and DialoX - an XML-based user interface\nengine\".\n\nI don't know if this domain specificity impacts go's stated general purpose systems\nprogramming - but the sourceforge area has commits back in 2000.\n\nInteresting!\u003c/pre\u003e",
