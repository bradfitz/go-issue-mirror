Who cares if it shares a name, seriously?  I would much rather the \nminds at Google spend the time on the technology then spend even one second on \nsomething as lame as changing a name, which in itself amounts to almost nothing in my \nopinion.  Sounds like most of the people here who care about the name, are also the \nkinds of people who put weight in things like business card titles and things like \nLinux certifications...
