It would seem evil to me to step on some\nlittle guy that is trying to get his language out there.  Hey guys and girls at\nGoogle, you could have, um, Googled for the name \"Go\" to see if it was already used.\n\nRename the new Google language to something other than \"Go\".\n\nPS Mr. McCabe, IANAL but I believe you have what is know as \"prior art\".  If Google\nwon't do the right thing then take them to court.  Put up a donation page to cover\nthe costs.  I am sure you will do fine.\u003c/pre\u003e",
