There wouldn't be nearly as big a stink over this if this new\nlanguage was by an independent \nindividual who wasn't associated with Google.  No one is using Mr. McCabe's language and\nno one is likely to \nstart using it in any great numbers anytime soon.  I'm sorry he was unable to gain any\ntraction with his language, \nbut there it is.  I vote for Google to keep the name \"GO\".\u003c/pre\u003e",
