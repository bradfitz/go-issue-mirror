For those of you who brought the C -\u003e C++ example:\nyour example isn't valid in this situation. C++ was actually a set of extensions to\nthe C language. Google's Go is NOT an extension to Go!, nor is Go! an extension to Go. \nI say rename the language. It's not that big of a deal. \n\nP.S.: And I don't think your \u0026[3]int{1,2,3} is going to get you anywhere, either.\nHave some common sense and pass references by value, like Java. Spare us the\npointers, will you? (my other half loves pointers though).\u003c/pre\u003e",
