Google is a big company! with departments and many teams and lawyers, etc! \nMany people here talk like the name of the programming language that was a product fo \nthe 20% rule of Google was chosen by Eric Schmidt, Sergey Brin or Larry Page!\nWhen a company like Google (OR ANY OTHER COMPANY, LIKE MINE!) wants to choose a name \nfor something, the FIRST thing it checks is if there is a COPYRIGHT!\n\nI still think It would be better if they change the name... but I don't think that \nthey must! And don't think that \"they are evil\" if they don't!\u003c/pre\u003e",
