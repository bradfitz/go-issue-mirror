Natural language is not a namespace -- naming conflicts are to be\nexpected and welcomed, since they serve a very important purpose.\n\nI say, keep the naming conflict. Whichever language is used more will be used, and\nthe other will be forgotten; meanwhile, the confusion will allow cross-pollenation --\neveryone searching for one will see the other.\u003c/pre\u003e",
