Besides the two languages,\nit has two common meanings in English (the verb and the name of the board game), and\nit also means \"naked\" in Croatian, and \"him\" in Polish. This many existing meanings\nis what you would expect for such a short word.\n\nAnyway, who chooses a name for a programming language these days without googling\n\"\u003cfoo\u003e programming language\" to see if it's already taken? That's impolite at best;\neven downright negligent.\n\nThe paper on the original Go! language, incidentally, is at\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~klc/annals.pdf\"\u003ehttp://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~klc/annals.pdf\u003c/a\u003e . It's a concurrent-logic dialect of Prolog\nwith asynchronous message passing and Hindley-Milner type inference.\u003c/pre\u003e",
