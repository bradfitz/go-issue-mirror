I doubt it has\nanything to do with something with a different (although close) name when something\nwith the SAME name is already part of the language they're doing.  If you're going to\ncomplain about that complain about the fact that now searching for \"javascript\nclosure\" is ambiguous as to whether you mean the concept or the compiler.  Searching\nfor \"Clojure\" still returns the correct results.\n\nAs for the name, as you all rightly pointed out, one is called \"go\" and the other is\ncalled \"Go!\".  Am I the only person seeing the similarities between that and \"C\" and\n\"C#\"?  If you think that having an extra character is a problem, you should go speak\nto Microsoft first.  People also pointed out the fact that \"goo\" is already taken,\nwho is going to be first to demand they change their name too for being too close to\n\"Go!\"?  Or \"G\"?\n\nI suggest you see these lists:\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages\"\u003ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list\"\u003ehttp://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list\u003c/a\u003e\n\nSee how many languages there are on those lists where one name is only separated from\nanother name by one character?  Is this going to be a new campaign that any\nprogramming language must have at least 4 different characters from another\nprogramming language?\u003c/pre\u003e",
