Google is not stealing his work anyway. \n\n        \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/9\"\u003eissue #9\u003c/a\u003e is not a good name at all for the guys who worked hard to make such \na powerful and high performing language. Will this be a justice to them? It is not \nmatter of a big company or a small guy, this world run on mutual cooperation and \nunderstanding and both parties should understand this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
