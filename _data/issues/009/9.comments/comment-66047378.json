Clearly (for over 30 years now), P is the next (penultimate) language.\nOnce this group moves on to the next language (10-20 years), the (ultimate) language\nshould be called L thus completing the sequence.\n\nAlso, You guys deserve better than \"go\" no matter how you spell it.\n\n* Dennis and Ken have long lamented (that I've heard) calling UNIX \"UNIX\" (all caps)\ninstead of Unix or unix.  I like \"civilized\" spelling rather than shouting.  I say\nmake the language name a noun (e.g. unix/goop), and only capitalize it at the\nbeginning of sentences (e.g. Unix/Goop, if there is competition for P/p).\n\nCheers,\n  --ldl@linux.com\u003c/pre\u003e",
