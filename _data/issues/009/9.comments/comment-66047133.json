No, this is\na matter of the name \"Go\" being completely stupid. It is quite fortunate that McCabe\nused this name already and started this issue. Without that, the stupidity of the\nname would go ignored. I, for one, am glad that the name is in a position of\nreasonable change.\n\nBy this point, this \"discussion\" can only be sanely handled by a wiki document\nconcerning the matter. (Based on the above link or not.) This isn't even funny\nanymore. The only value further comments have is to become another statistic in the\nevent, with my own comment being no exception. If all you have to post is *more* name\nideas that have already been stated, or to upvote \"\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/9\"\u003eissue #9\u003c/a\u003e\" or any variation thereof,\n\nPLEASE RECONSIDER ADDING YOUR COMMENT.\u003c/pre\u003e",
