That name has been used for years too.\n\nHow well used is you language. Do you have a major following in place that use it or\nis is just something you used.\n\nYou mention a web site publishing. What about actual registering the name before\nGoogle gets a hold of it? \n\nOver time eventually every word or name can claimed to be used. If you don't actually\nregister its usage or copryright/left or trademark it I guess your shot.\u003c/pre\u003e",
