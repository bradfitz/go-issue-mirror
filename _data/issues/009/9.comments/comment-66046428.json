Google's Go is only a day old, not too much to lose if they change the \nname now.\n\nAlso, maybe little guy has some money, or will find some money, and litigate, as he's \nalready expressed his displeasure at the collision.\n\nI think it's best for everyone if Google just mans up and makes the change now. In \nthe end it will only generate more publicity for both Gos, and everyone will be \nhappy, and the threat of unpleasant ramifications (including bad PR and possible \nlitigation) vanishes. There is no abundance of documentation or online help that will \nbe derailed right now if Google makes the change, though I'd reckon a language that's \nbeen around for 10 years has some. \n\nFingers crossed that Google will do it, though I doubt they will.\u003c/pre\u003e",
