Do you\nthink they would care? ... Offcourse they would care and they would drag you to court\nand have you pay them a multi billion dollar compensation. It does not mather if the\nname only looks like Google even. I remember there have been cases on this before, in\nNorway aswell. We cant let Google think they can own wathever they like.\n\nThey may call it business. They may claim that \"hey, GO as a name was not registered\ntrademark\", but this is all aboute gentlemans behaviour.\n\nThere is only one option and this is that Google changes it names. If not, they will\nin my eyes legitime for others to use Google or google look alike names wherever, and\nwhenever you like.\u003c/pre\u003e",
