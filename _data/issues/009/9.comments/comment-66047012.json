There is no confusion, and there is no real difficulty\nin finding help for those languages.\n\nI think this is a non-issue and is just an excuse for people to get into the\ntown-hall mentality of yelling out absurdities and not looking at the facts.\n\nWhile I agree that Go is not the best name I have seen, it is a fine name, and\nnothing wrong with it. These guys put a lot of work into the code with that name so\njust stick with it. Go and Go! can co-exist, even if !Go comes out.\u003c/pre\u003e",
