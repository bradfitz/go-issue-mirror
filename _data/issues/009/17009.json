	"body": "I disabled the `darwin-386-*` builders temporarily, pending some refactoring of the build coordinator to separate out builder machine types vs build configs. Right now we only have one type of thing, which means there are separate pools, and buildlet reuse is trickier.\r\n\r\nClean that up, and redo the dashboard/builders.go to have a distinction of machine types and build types.\r\n\r\nThere might be a dupe bug about this, but this one tracks darwin-386-* at least.\r\n",
