Are you producing standalone\nbinaries from a single directory, or do you have import paths referring\nto other directories?  The main reason for $GOPATH is the latter case,\nso that when you see an import you know where to look for the \nimported code.  For standalone single-directory programs we can\nrelax the rules and let the go build / go test work outside $GOPATH,\nand I plan to do that.\n\nThat is, code you import must be in a $GOPATH (otherwise how can\nwe find it) but the top-level package (usually package main) need not be.\nI plan to remove the restriction about the top-level package being\nin $GOPATH.\n\nDoes this address the case you have in mind?  If not, can you give\nmore details about how the go tool would resolve import paths in\nthe case you have in mind?\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n_Labels changed: added **priority-go1**, **go1-must**, removed **priority-triage**._\n\n_Owner changed to **builder@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
