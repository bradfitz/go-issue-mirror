The downside is that it\nresults in parallel trees for go code and all the other code; for example, we put\nnetworking code under net/ and build tools under tools/ and if we went this route we'd\nneed go/src/net/ and go/src/tools/.  (And even then, the package names would maybe\nconflict with the real go package names when you \"install\" them?)\n\nThis all seems so wrong I figured I must be missing something important, which is why I\nposted on G+ instead of filing a bug.  I came here once Ian suggested that the \"go tool\n6g\" route was my best bet and that I should start a bug on the remaining issues.\u003c/pre\u003e",
