My\nunderstanding so far is that, given that our tree has code other than Go code in it,\nwe're supposed to be using \"go tool 6g\" etc., that means we'll need our own build rules\nfor building everything which means we'll be managing our own include paths etc.\nmanually.  Which is fine enough, except for that I don't know how to make the Go\n\"testing\" package work in such a world.\u003c/pre\u003e",
