I found out that it's because in my trunk version of sel_ldr, SecureRandom\r\nnamed service has been removed. see https://codereview.chromium.org/550523002.\r\n\r\n@rsc  What should we do here? Should we switch to use NaClSysGetRandomBytes\r\n(syscall 150)? It's introduced in https://codereview.chromium.org/537543003\r\n3 months ago.\r\n\r\nI think the best way for 1.5 is to migrate to the syscall, since we can remove the SRPC\r\nimplementation in syscall, and our random also needs random bytes now.\r\n\r\nHowever, migrating means we lose the ability to use older sel_ldrs.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
