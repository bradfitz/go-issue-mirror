If you switch to ListTags like the Stack Overflow responder suggests, it appears to correctly list the Go releases.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close, because I think this is working as intended at the moment.  If you think the Go project should alter its release workflow to make use of GitHub Releases, I suggest going through the [Go proposal process](https://golang.org/s/proposal-process).",
