	"body": "@tgrosinger You are correct - they should format the same:\r\n\r\n1) The spacing changes when going from http://play.golang.org/p/ToSuqHfqWu to http://play.golang.org/p/rVyw-A9om1 - the difference is just the added parentheses around the slice expression. However, the slice expression already introduces a form of parentheses (square brackets), so inside there shouldn't be a change.\r\n\r\n2) There are long-standing TODOs for exactly this issue in go/printer:776 (also line 769).\r\n\r\nThe fix is trivial, but in the interest of not introducing lots of changes over huge amounts of code, we haven't pushed it through, and I suggest leaving it as is for now.\r\n\r\nThat said, I've been working on a new version of gofmt (long overdue, hopefully after 1.5 I can concentrate on finishing it) which should solve many of the open gofmt issues. This may be a good time to address this one as well.",
