It can't send the\nexact same Time twice because the Time value itself never changes during a pass. What it\ncan do is not skip enough ticks, if processing earlier timers takes enough time that a\ntick on a later timer should have passed. But it won't re-invoke the same timer until a\nsubsequent pass through the timer list (with a new Time value). Assuming that this code\nis not only non-blocking but also non-yielding then I guess this isn't really a problem,\nbecause a timer with a period so small that processing a single timer takes longer than\nthe tick is already broken.\n\nSo lets set that diversion to rest.\n\nRegardless, my original point about the timer not working with 100% accuracy is still a\nconcern. With the proposed modification, skipped ticks can be detected with 100%\naccuracy and with no delays in detection, and it involves no API changes. I also cannot\nthink of any reason why existing code that uses Timers would break with this change.\u003c/pre\u003e",
