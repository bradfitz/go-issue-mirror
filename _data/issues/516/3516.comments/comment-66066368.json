I'm not sure what the Go runtime's behavior is when sending a value\nto an empty buffered channel with a pending reader (e.g. whether it wakes up the reader\nimmediately, or whether it continues the current goroutine and yields later). Internally\nit'll certainly call the runtimeTimer.f function twice in the scenario I described, I'm\njust unsure what the risk of actually managing to get two identical time.Time values\npassed to a client-visible Timer.C channel is.\u003c/pre\u003e",
