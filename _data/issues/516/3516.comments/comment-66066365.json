Using this Time value is\nno better than just grabbing time.Now() before scheduling the timer.\n\nThis could actually be fixed without any API changes by simply modifying the Time passed\ninto the timer. Instead of using the current time, just send in the 'when' field. For\nperiodic timers, this should actually be the updated 'when' field minus the period, so\nthat it reflects the fact that ticks (may) have been skipped.\u003c/pre\u003e",
