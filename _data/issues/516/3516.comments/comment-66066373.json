I suppose it's a fairly\ntrivial complaint, since the difference is pretty small, and I'm operating at 100KHz\nanyway. But this is also a fairly academic project, what with me trying to run a\ncycle-accurate emulation of a fake CPU. I admit the actual start time of the CPU doesn't\nreally matter in the slightest, but I just don't like the fact that I'm not getting\ntruly accurate ticks.\n\nAnyway, at this point I'm basically just using the ticker as a way to drive my own test\nfor missed ticks. While that will certainly produce results, it also annoys me. It also\nfeels like the time value passed into the channel is completely pointless, since it\ndoesn't have much meaning. Passing the runtimeTicker.when field (modified appropriately\nby the period) into the channel instead would at least provide some real useful meaning\nto that value.\u003c/pre\u003e",
