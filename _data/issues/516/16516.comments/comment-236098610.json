All `git` commands on package repos would then have the pull rebasing turned off.  I don't think that's an annoying workaround.\r\n\r\nWe already do submodule update (https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/go/vcs.go#L136).\r\nIf you'd like to add a comment to the `go get`, that's fine, but I think `go get` does not need more complicated vcs support.",
