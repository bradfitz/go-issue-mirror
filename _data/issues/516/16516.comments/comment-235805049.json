To do this it tries to `go get` them. I'm not really in the loop, except to say \"sure install/update those things\" and then to observe the failures.\r\n\r\nPresumably anything else trying to use `go get` to pull in updates to dependencies would be susceptible to the same thing, and so in this case it would be nice to at least be able to tell go what I'd like that default to be in repos it clones, or to have it work around that requirement somehow.",
