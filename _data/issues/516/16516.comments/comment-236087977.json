	"body": "I'm afraid this feels like somewhere between WAI and a big in Git to me. You have configured Git is such a way that it can't make commits, and then you're asking `go get` to do a thing that might involve making commits. It's not up to`go get` to fix your broken configuration. If there were a reasonable default value for `user.email` that `go get` could set, you would have it in your global config already.\r\n\r\nThat said, the bug in Git is that it would treat them differently. Both `rebase=true` and `rebase=false` can make commits, and IIUC in the same situations.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue as WAI as far as Go is concerned. If you think there is some specific behavior Go could have to make this better, please comment, but AFAICT there isn't.",
