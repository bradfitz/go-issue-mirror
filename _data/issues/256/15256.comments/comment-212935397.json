	"body": "@bradfitz sorry for the long delay. Finally got my machine back. Here's the sample code I was using. If you use openssl to check the CommonName of certPEM, you will see it properly reports it as `client/emailAddress=de9c5ec1c4af2d9bdbbefcbc7134f9032e3b5db88bea56a3`. However, the code is only reporting the CommonName as `client` and throws away the rest. Let me know if you are having any problems reproducing this problem.",
