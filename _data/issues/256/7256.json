I've come across\nthis when I tried to debug a go program that makes HTTP requests by passing all\ncommunication through a HTTP debugging proxy:\n\n  http_proxy=localhost:8888 myprog ...\n\nHowever since this program makes HTTP requests to a *local test server*, my proxy\nconfiguration was silently ignored.\n\nThe only way around this was to literally reimplement `http.ProxyFromEnvironment` in my\nprogram without the needless special case for localhost.\n\ngo version 1.2\u003c/pre\u003e",
