	"body": "Implementing these interfaces is less trivial than it seems.\r\n\r\nFast and looseless implementation could use hexadecimal notation with 'p' (binary) exponent. But it depends about the expectations of MarshalText: Should it always return a string representation that is a \"standard\" floating-point number that might be read by another system? In that case, the 'p' notation might not be option.\r\n\r\nAn implementation that is more similar to float32/64 can use 'g' with precision -1 (once implemented) but it's a very expensive conversion. Additionally currently there is no way to parse a string without loosing precision. Parse's semantic may actually not be correct as is: It perhaps should parse w/o rounding error if the precision is 0.",
