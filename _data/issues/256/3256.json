Post additional random data to it.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe program prints the number of requests it handled in one second and the number of\nbytes received.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nListenAndServe:AcceptEx tcp 0.0.0.0:8081: The specified network name is no longer\navailable.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows Server 2008 R2 64-bit running inside VmWare 8\n\nWhich revision are you using?
