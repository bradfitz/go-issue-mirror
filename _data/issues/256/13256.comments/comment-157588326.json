However, is not clear to me that it\ncould only happen with MAP_FIXED, there seems to be no reason to me why a\nregular mmap can't succeed on another thread and return that address. It\nseems to imply a lot more inside knowledge of how mmap works on a variety\nof unixy systems than what I'm comfortable with. It may well be possible,\nbut it's already on a rare code path and the circumstances around the race\nare likely very rare or even impossible. Code that crashes very\noccasionally is still useful, in fact that describes pretty much every\nsoftware system out there. It's fine by me to focus on more important\nthings and address this when/if bug reports come in from the wild.\n\nOn Tue, Nov 17, 2015, 4:25 PM Ian Lance Taylor \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e Ah, yes, I see what you mean.
