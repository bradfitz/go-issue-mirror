I have another program (which unfortunately I can't share\nin its entirety) that uses 50 goroutines to post files to this server - using\nclient.Do() as shown in the Go example code, and using the default Transport object. It\nalso sets Request.Close to false (just in case). In the past, it seemed like keep-alives\nlimited the total connections to around 50. In 2012-03-04, the connections don't seem to\nbe reused anymore. I know there were recent changes to the net/http package relating to\nproxies and keep-alives, but I haven't identified a bug yet, just this symptom which I\nthink is a real problem.\n\nThe basic file posting loop is at \u003ca href=\"http://pastie.org/3555622\"\u003ehttp://pastie.org/3555622\u003c/a\u003e - in older versions of Go I\nhad tested the connection behavior pretty thoroughly.\u003c/pre\u003e",
