The best I was able to find is a few sentences at https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/Internals%20Debugging-File-Formats (which may be sufficient).\r\n\r\nI presume the relocations must apply to the decompressed sections, even though the section table technically says they apply to the compressed sections? In that case, I think we have to do this in debug/elf before passing the sections to debug/dwarf, simply because debug/elf handles the relocations.",
