Windows service is started automatically by OS every time OS boots. For that OS keeps list of all Windows service executables (full paths). So if you want your Windows service to be started by OS, you have to give OS your executable path. You can rely on user to enter correct path, but it is much easier and safer if the service executable could determine its own path.\r\n\r\nI didn't know that Windows had an API for it when I wrote this\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/golang/sys/blob/master/windows/svc/example/install.go#L18\r\n\r\nI should have used GetModuleFileName in there instead.\r\n\r\nAlso nearly all Windows GUI executables include \"resources\": icons, bitmaps, form dialogues and others. Windows GUIs use resources extensively when they run. But appropriate Windows APIs find resources automatically. So you don't need to worry about finding your executable path.\r\n\r\nAlex",
