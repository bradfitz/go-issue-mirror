A valid UTF-8 sequence cannot appear in the middle of some\nother unrelated sequence, EXCEPT for the empty string. So to make that guarantee, the\nempty string is the only case that needs special handling. For example, if you are\ntrying to do search and replace on UTF-8 text correctly, then the empty string has to be\nhandled carefully: you only want to match the empty string between adjacent runes, not\nthe one in the middle of multibyte runes.\n\nYou can disagree with the decision to make these routines UTF-8-friendly, but they are.\nCount, Replace, Split all take care to handle the empty string correctly.\n\nI am sorry it surprised you, but it's working as intended. Like I said, it's fine to\nchange the docs.\u003c/pre\u003e",
