	"body": "Sorry for the false alert. The problem I mentioned in the last comment is\r\ncaused by me running trybot on the wrong patch set. Will file a separate\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nUpdate: the actual reason is not me running on the wrong patch set.\r\nIt's because the auto-merge feature of Gerrit failed to merge the\r\nchange correctly. How could that be possible? (Note patch set 2 is created\r\nby Gerrit, not by the author of the CL.)\r\n\r\nSo again, trybot should use rebase to test the patch in order to catch this\r\nproblem.",
