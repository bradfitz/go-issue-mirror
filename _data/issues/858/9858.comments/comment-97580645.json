And at least some of us do pretty much nothing but multi-CL changes.\n\nIn the case of a commit hash where the parent is on origin/master (so it's either the bottom of or not part of a multi-CL change) then rebasing would be fine. But it's very important not to rebase otherwise, unless somehow you rebase the entire sequence.",
