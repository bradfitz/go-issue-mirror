Struct field tags have evolved in a very powerful way and used for numerous unrelated things things: file encoding (JSON, XML, YAML, INI, etc.), database/datastore definitions, environment variables, and so on. \r\n2. Often is desirable to have different portions application use the same data structure without needing to be coupled to the the other uses of field tags. For example a database layer should not need to be aware of the JSON representation used in an API.\r\n3. In some cases it may be desirable to have different field tags used at different layers in an application. For example, a struct may need to be serialized different JSON property names to save it to disk then is used for providing via an API.\r\n4. As mentioned by @ianlancetaylor and @robpike it would be backwards-compatible.",
