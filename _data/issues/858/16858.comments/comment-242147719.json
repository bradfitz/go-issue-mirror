In practice, the CRLDP is just a URL and the RFC is hugely over engineered. `[]string` is perhaps even too general here and it should just have been a `string` or a [url.URL](https://godoc.org/net/url#URL).\r\n\r\nWhen more detailed dissection of X.509 structures is needed it's more appropriate to handle that in the package where it's needed. (For which I apologise for `encoding/asn1`, which was a mistaken design. You might well want to build a simple, imperative DER parser.)",
