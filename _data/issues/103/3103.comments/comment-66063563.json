I think the action is in libgcc/libgcov.c.\n\nThe __gcov_init function has a comment that says: \"Add a new object file onto the bb\nchain. Invoked automatically when running an object file's global ctors.\"\n\nAmongst other things, __gcov_init calls atexit(gcov_exit).\n\nI think gcov_exit takes care of looking at GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP and GCOV_PREFIX and writing\nthe .gcna files.\n\nI'm guessing that __gcov_init isn't been called in the Go binary.\n\nThere is also __gcov_flush, which looks important: \"Called before fork or exec - write\nout profile information gathered so far and reset it to zero. This avoids duplication or\nloss of the profile information gathered so far.\"\u003c/pre\u003e",
