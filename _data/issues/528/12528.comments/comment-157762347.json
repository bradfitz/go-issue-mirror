	"body": "Here's our plan for fixing the problem I mentioned above, though it's not clear these are responsible for this issue. For 1, we're going to make gentraceback check if the starting PC is in stackBarrier and reconstruct a starting PC and the unwound stkbarPos from stkbar and the current SP. For 2 and 3, we're going to take stackLock around these operations and make sigprof only attempt to acquire stackLock once and otherwise give up (otherwise it may self-deadlock).\r\n\r\n@vsdutka, @daemonfire300, can you still reproduce this issue easily enough that you could try out these fixes once they're ready?",
