Anything that can help us\nreproduce the problem is what we are looking for. If that is not possible\nanything that you have that you can make public is what we want.\n\n\nOn Tue, Oct 6, 2015 at 11:24 AM, Austin Clements \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e @daemonfire300 \u003chttps://github.com/daemonfire300\u003e, I mean we need the\n\u003e actual error printed by the crash to debug this, including the exact error\n\u003e message and the stack traces that follow the error message that involve\n\u003e functions in the runtime.
