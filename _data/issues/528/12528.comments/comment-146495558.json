Can I use gdb?\n\n2015-10-08 2:52 GMT+03:00 Austin Clements \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e:\n\n\u003e I can post the cpu pprof and pprof memory files as pdf if that is helping?\n\u003e Because I dont get a stacktrace, same as the other users.\n\u003e\n\u003e Thanks, but I don't think this would help. What's happening is that an\n\u003e internal check for an invariant in the runtime is failing. Most likely\n\u003e whatever's going wrong is going wrong an instant before the failure.\n\u003e\n\u003e It's unfortunate that the runtime isn't printing a stack trace, but there\n\u003e are other ways to get a stack trace. It's likely that if we can get a stack\n\u003e trace, the problem will be obvious. Please run your program under gdb, set\n\u003e a breakpoint on the panic with \"br 'runtime.throw'\" (note the single\n\u003e quotes), run it with \"run\" until it stops at the panic, and use \"bt\" to\n\u003e print a stack trace.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/12528#issuecomment-146369534\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
