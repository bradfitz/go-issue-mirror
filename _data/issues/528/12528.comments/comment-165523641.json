According to this it found the next stack barrier at exactly where it was supposed to be. This may be a tight race where the stkbar array was updated between the check in gentraceback and the panic print.\r\n\r\nI read that wrong. The @@@ indicates gp.stkbarPos, while the ==\u003e indicates where gentraceback found the unexpected stack barrier. However, the message is slightly misleading in this case: we didn't actually go through the two stack barriers it's printing; rather gentraceback wasn't expecting any more stack barriers from the list of stack barriers it captured when it started. It may have started with an empty list, or it may have successfully unwound some barriers that aren't the ones being printed (though starting with an empty list seems more likely). At some point between when gentraceback started (and captured its expected stack barrier list) and when it found this stack barrier,  something else set the stack barrier list that's being printed.",
