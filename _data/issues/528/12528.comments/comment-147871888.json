	"body": "It's not obvious to me why the values at $rsp mean anything.  The gdb backtrace:\r\n\r\n#0  0x0000000000430310 in runtime.throw ()\r\n#1  0x0000000000453dc0 in runtime.writebarrierptr_nostore1.func1 ()\r\n\r\nis clear: it is backtracing to the function called via systemstack from writebarrierptr_nostore1.  This is on the system stack, which is why gdb can't backtrace any further.  But when you look at $rsp from that point, you are just seeing the system stack.  You aren't seeing the Go call stack, which is some goroutine call stack, at some completely different location.",
