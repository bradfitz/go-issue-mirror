If they were slightly larger, they would be rejected outright.\r\n\r\nIn general, we can't compare the data length against the buffer size because the stream may contain type definitions, which mean some of the data will be in a second, as yet unread, message. We could put in a really complicated test for those cases that are guaranteed to be in this message, but since the goal here is hardening, that's pointless: other data types can still trigger the big allocation\r\n",
