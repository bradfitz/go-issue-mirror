Then one has the opportunity to check the\nCL before sending it out.\n\nThat will also make it easier to experience and test the review command.\nRight now I can't test the mail part because that will unnecessarily spam\ngolang-codereviews mailing list.\n\nOr could we set up a dummy go repo for testing purposes (even on a separate\ntesting gerrit instance)? We can configure that to not send emails to the\nmailing list and only to the author of the change. It will definitely help\npeople to get familiar with the tools and file feature requests and bug\nreports.",
