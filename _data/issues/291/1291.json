Open the cgo life example ($GOROOT/misc/cgo/life)\n2. Open life.go\na. Change //export GoStart to //export Aaa\nb. Change //export GoWait to //export Bb\n3. Open c-life.c\na. Change GoStart_return to Aaa_return\nb. Change calls to GoStart to Aaa\nc. Change calls to GoWait to Bb\n4. make life \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./life\n\nWhat's really strange is that if you change 'Aaa' to 'Aa', above, everything works\nperfectly.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nlife game board, as usual\n\nWhat do you see instead?\ndyld: Symbol not found: __cgoexp_Bb\n  Referenced from: /Users/roberthencke/go/pkg/darwin_amd64/cgo_life.so\n  Expected in: flat namespace\n in /Users/roberthencke/go/pkg/darwin_amd64/cgo_life.so\nTrace/BPT trap\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g (cgo)\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nMac OS X 10.6 (amd64)\n\nWhich revision are you using?
