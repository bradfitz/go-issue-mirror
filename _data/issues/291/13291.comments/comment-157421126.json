I was hoping for some argument that there was a popular spec I'd never heard of which relied on such formats.\r\n\r\nI think this is well beyond the point of diminishing returns. It adds more weight to the time package than utility.\r\n\r\nWe've both now written more keystrokes in this bug than we'd ever save users wanting these formats. But we would've added more cognitive load to the docs.\r\n\r\nClosing as not meeting the bar.\r\n",
