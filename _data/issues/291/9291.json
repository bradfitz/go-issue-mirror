	"body": "Rick got burned by running 'git commit' instead of 'git change' and ending up in a branch with two commits. Then git mail helpfully pushed them both to Gerrit, which helpfully created two changes.\r\n\r\nSomething in the review tool should detect multiple commits and print an error and die.\r\nMaybe git mail, or maybe something earlier.\r\n\r\nNote that I am NOT saying people can't use the multiple commit mode of Gerrit, I'm just saying that the review tool isn't going to help them do that, at least not by default.\r\n\r\n@adg",
