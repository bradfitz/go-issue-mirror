All tests passed except for \"math/rand\" which timed\nout (known issue) and \"gob\" which ran out of memory (also a known issue).\nThere was no swap partition at the time.\nThis should work (I think) on both model A and B Raspberry Pi's, as they both have\n~256MB of physical RAM.\u003c/pre\u003e",
