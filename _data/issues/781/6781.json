(run 'go version')\ngo version devel +341a490e4736 Fri Nov 08 11:31:44 2013 -0500 linux/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nUsing the type names that cgo uses internally doesn't help in understanding the, at\ntimes, already not that easy to understand errors that cgo produces. This can especially\ntrip up people who are experimenting with cgo for the first time.\n\nThe issue is made worse by the fact that half of the error uses the internal format\n(`*_Ctype_int`) while the other half uses the same format as used in actual Go code\n(`C.size_t`)\u003c/pre\u003e",
