	"body": "by **grahamalexanderharris**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. hg clone -u tip \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go\u003c/a\u003e\n2. export GOARM=5\n3. cd go/src\n4. ./all.bash\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nSuccessful compilation and tests, resulting in working binaries for the go compiler,\nwith the work around for broken hardware floating point on the PI.\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe build runs, but some lines have \u0026quot;: signal 9\u0026quot; appended (see attached\noutput). go/bin/gofmt is produced, but it is the only thing in the go/bin directory.\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\nI'm not sure, the system is Arch Linux for arm, with gcc and glibc installed. I also\nhave mercurial working.\nI have GOARM=5 set to avoid the issues with floating point ops which have crippled the\nofficial Arch go package for Arm.\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nArch Linux from the Raspberry PI downloads page (\u003ca href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads)\"\u003ehttp://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads)\u003c/a\u003e.\n\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nI can't run \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot;, as I can't build go, but I have used \u0026quot;hg\npull\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;hg update tip\u0026quot; to get the latest version. This issue also\nseems to occur without GOARM=5 and with the \u0026quot;release\u0026quot; version from the\nmercurial repository.\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nI'm using a Raspberry PI \u0026quot;model B\u0026quot;, which has a network connection, 2GB\nfilesystem, and (I think) ~500MB RAM.\nI resorted to trying to cross compile go from my i386 laptop, but I can't get it to\nproduce all of the binaries for arm. I've tried setting GOARCH=arm and GOHOSTARCH=arm,\nto not useful effect. With the tip version, go/bin/linux_arm/go isn't produced.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3781/0/go_build_pi.txt\"\u003ego_build_pi.txt\u003c/a\u003e (2358 bytes)",
