Or the binary that broke?\n\nIf this is in a go-fuzz-built binary, not go-fuzz itself, I wonder if go-fuzz is trying to instrument package runtime and broke the signal handlers somehow.\n\nThe decimal g= below really is 0xc820ad8000 aka m-\u003egsignal, so that part is right. But obviously the stack bounds are not. That means that somehow the code is either on the wrong stack or overflowed the signal stack. The latter could happen if the signal handler somehow caused a new signal to arrive and be handled. I thought we had signals masked off such that that isn't allowed and would just be a plain OS-level process crash, but maybe some signals can leak through. If it happened recursively repeatedly, you'd blow out the signal stack.\n\n@dvyukov",
