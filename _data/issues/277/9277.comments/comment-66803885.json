It recommends running git change branchname, and it was not clear to me branches are easily reusable, I assumed they needed to be recreated each time.\r\n\r\nI have no UI suggestion to make this clearer, but maybe the fact that a work branch can be reused should be called out in the documentation. Right now http://golang.org/doc/contribute.html doesn't make it obvious.",
