	"body": "by **rafrombrc**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eOne feature that I have wished to have is the ability to export names from the *_test.go\nfiles in one package such that they can only be used by *_test.go files in other\npackages. This is not possible, but it occurred to me recently that this can be\napproximated by the use of compiler build tags. In fact, if the test tool automatically\ninjected a standard build tag (e.g. \u0026quot;testrun\u0026quot;), then it would be trivial to\nadd files to a package containing code that would only be exported when tests were being\nrun. (The files couldn't be named \u0026quot;*_test.go\u0026quot;, of course, but the effect would\nbe the same.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
