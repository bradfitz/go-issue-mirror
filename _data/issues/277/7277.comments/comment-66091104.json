If you are writing to random addresses, it can lead to\narbitrary consequences, we can not reliably panic in all such cases.\nI second the concern about runtime corruption. Whenever we saw such crash, it was a\nserious corruption of runtime, continuing in such case makes no sense and dangerous.\nAlso think of a malicious code that probes system data structures.\nIf you want to execute untrusted code, you need to do it in a separate process. It has\n1000 and 1 way to crash the process (or do something worse). Then simplest way it to\nstart a goroutine that panics, or allocate all memory, etc, etc.\u003c/pre\u003e",
