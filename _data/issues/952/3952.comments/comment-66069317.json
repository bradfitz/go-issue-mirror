As this is a platform specific implementation detail, I\nwould not be opposed to Sys() returning either, and the caller being responsible for\ndetermining if its supposed to be a Win32FileAttributeData or ByHandleFileInformation\nvia reflect or the like.\n\nDoes something else make more sense?\u003c/pre\u003e",
