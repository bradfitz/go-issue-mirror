In fact, looking\nat the code, we already have\n\nfunc atime(fi FileInfo) time.Time\n\nimplemented in os. It is used for os tests only, but we could expose this functionality.\nIf someone wants to suggest the interface, I am happy to implement and test windows side\nof things.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
