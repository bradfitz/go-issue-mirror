To my reading the current behaviour is not what was\nspecified in the proposal.\n\nThis gets a number of user/developers who expect to be able to update\ntheir package originally checked out with git: by using go get. An an\nexample is here[2].\n\nThere are two possible approaches to fixing this - both trivial,\ndepending on checking that p.ImportComment != \"\" in\ncmd/go/downloadPackage[3] and either issuing a non-misleading error\n(don't mention custom import paths since there was none) or just allow\nthe completion of the request.\n\nAre either of these acceptable?\n\n[1]https://golang.org/s/go14customimport\n[2]https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/Zi-Kw2tbif8/discussion\n[3]https://github.com/golang/go/blob/db454afd2353364ad1c3bcd6002def81871ed2b2/src/cmd/go/get.go#L302",
