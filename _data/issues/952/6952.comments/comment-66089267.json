I should have\npicked up this error at the time, but I did not. Also, the arm5 builder was having a lot\nof problems at the time so we didn't see the failure there either.\n\nThe build prior to this change failed because the build ran overtime (possibly due to\nswapping)\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://build.golang.org/log/54affd91a0e0f18f4f4886e7978ffd3fd7c022f1\"\u003ehttp://build.golang.org/log/54affd91a0e0f18f4f4886e7978ffd3fd7c022f1\u003c/a\u003e\n\nthe build after shows the failure we see now\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://build.golang.org/log/99a93b5715c6684fedcbe556cef3e2180a17f3a9\"\u003ehttp://build.golang.org/log/99a93b5715c6684fedcbe556cef3e2180a17f3a9\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThis patch fixes the alignment issue by loading runtime.goarm as a byte\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/cl/46240043/\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/cl/46240043/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
