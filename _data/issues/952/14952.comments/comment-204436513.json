The `net/http` package has only been getting stricter over time.\r\n\r\nEven if we found a nice way for you to send bogus outgoing HTTP requests, I would want to make it opt-in, so we never speak invalid HTTP by default. But then we'd want to do the same thing for the HTTP server.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I bet there there already a dozen HTTP requests you won't be able to handle with the `net/http` server because they're rejected before your Handler gets it. I might even add rejecting bogus Request-Line targets now that I'm aware of it.\r\n\r\nSo really this bug is about deciding whether we add an opt-in mechanism for both client \u0026 server to allow bogus stuff.\r\n",
