For example, the following code is correct\n\nfunc Foo() float64 {\n    return 0\n}\n\nHere, 0 is used as a float64, not as an int. Thus, it seems like the error message\nshould be \n\n\"cannot use 0 (untyped constant literal) as type []float64 in return argument\"\n\nOne may never use an int as a float64, but one may use an untyped constant literal as a\nfloat64\u003c/pre\u003e",
