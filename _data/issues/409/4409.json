This creates a separate local variable with the\nsame name and, in certain scenarios, the effects of this bug can be quite subtle. \n\nIn the interests of code quality -- and given the general aversion to compiler warnings\n-- perhaps explicit var declarations should be required for a local variable that shares\nthe same name as a global variables.\u003c/pre\u003e",
