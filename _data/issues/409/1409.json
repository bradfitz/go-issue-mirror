	"body": "by **alopecoid**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eCould we rename the various conversion methods in strconv to be more clear and\nconsistent?\n\nFor example, instead of Itoa and Atoi, why not FromInt and ToInt? Or if we really want\nto keep the FooToBar pattern, IntToString and StringToInt?\n\nI think the methods are more readable this way. Also, Itoa looks a lot like the keyword\n\u0026quot;iota\u0026quot;, does't it?\n\nAdditionally, the current naming seems to be a left-over from C... doesn't itoa stand\nfor \u0026quot;int to array\u0026quot;? Being that Go strings aren't \u0026quot;raw\u0026quot; arrays, I\nthink it would be nice to shed this naming convention.\n\nAlso, I don't think the current naming is consistent with Go's style because it doesn't\nreally seem to follow proper CamelCase, which would be IToA and AToI, etc.\u003c/pre\u003e",
