(I've been using\n$GOROOT/src/pkg/runtime/$GOARCH/asm.s)\n3. Get a segmentation fault.\n\nI've reproduced with both 6a and 8a. I'm assuming 5a does the same thing.\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\n4d7f5eddd695 tip\n\nThe problem is due to a buffer overflow in macinc cc/macbody. symb is an\narray of 500 characters and it's filled using strcpy without checking the\nlength of the source. $INCLUDE happens to be one of these sources and it's\neasier than you might think to exceed 500 characters -- particularly in cygwin.\n\nThere might be other buffer overflows possible in this file through similar\nmeans. There are a number of strcpy calls.\u003c/pre\u003e",
