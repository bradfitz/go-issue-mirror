	"body": "When encrypting specific (in my case gzip compressed) plaintexts it seems that `golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp` generates ciphertexts which can then no longer be decrypted with the gpg cli tool. Those broken ciphertexts can be decrypted with the openpgp package itself just fine though. \r\n\r\nI created a gist with some example plaintexts (good and bad) and some test code to reproduce the issue at https://gist.github.com/tobstarr/a4afa1ec7abf06fbe9e5\r\n\r\nAs described in the gist I tested it both with gpg versions 1.4.16 on ubuntu 14.04 and gpg version 1.4.18 on ubuntu 15.10 with my own key (4096 RSA) and a newly generated one (2048 RSA).",
