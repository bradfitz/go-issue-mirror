	"body": "\u003e I opened the issue because one way to understand passing \"\" as a base directory is 'I don't care where, just make it work'\r\n\r\nioutil gives a reference to the os.TempDir. Neither ioutil.TempDir or ioutil.TempFile are meant to be just working if an empty dir is given.\r\n\r\nI don't like the fact that we are returning a custom error from ioutil functions whereas users who depend on os.TempDir directly need to handle a different error. I think more docs would help, noting what happens if the directory doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nYour issue also applies for the arbitrary values of the dir. What does the following code suppose to return? Custom error?\r\n\r\n```\r\nioutil.TempDir(\"/doesnt-exist\", \"foo\")\r\n```",
