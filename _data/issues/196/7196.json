	"body": "by **steven.hartland@multiplay.co.uk**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n1. create a app which uses a long running CGI process\n2. disconnect while receiving the output from the CGI request\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe CGI process should be aborted\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe CGI process is still running\n\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nFreeBSD 8.3-RELEASE\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.2 freebsd/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nPatch attached which fixes the issue for us. Its quite harsh in that it uses Kill but I\nbelieve its the only 100% safe way to avoid leaking processes as just calling .Cost on\nthe process io streams may not have the desired effect.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/7196/0/cgi-proc-leak.patch\"\u003ecgi-proc-leak.patch\u003c/a\u003e (599 bytes)",
