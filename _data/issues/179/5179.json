	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe old hashmap allowed concurrent reads.\n\nThe new hashmap code didn't, and led to crashes when GOMAXPROCS \u0026gt; 1.\n\nFrom khr:\n\n-----------\nSo I think we've found the problem.  It is triggered by two parallel reads to a map.  My\nhashmap implementation was assuming that wouldn't happen.  Internally, the hash table is\ngrown lazily and I was doing a little bit of growing work during each read.  That\ngrowing work can't happen in parallel and causes corruption.\n\nThe quick fix is to disable growing work on reads.  I'll try to get that in today.  The\nlonger fix would be to have some internal synchronization for the growing work.\n------------\n\nSeveral other bugs may or may not be this issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
