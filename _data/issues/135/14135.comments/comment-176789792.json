	"body": "Thanks @cyberphone. I have no problem with producing the correct last digit, since Go already does. However, on closer examination it looks like maybe JS doesn't get later digits correct: 999999999999999868928 is an exact float64 value. Go prints it correctly as 999999999999999868928 (%f) or as 9.999999999999999e+20 (%g/%e), while Chrome prints it as 999999999999999900000. Does ECMA-262 mandate this too? Can you point to a page in the PDF that I can read? Thanks.",
