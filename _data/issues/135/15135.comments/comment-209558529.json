	"body": "Based on Ian's latest comments I have reverted my patch back to the minimum change needed to ztypes_linux_ppc64le.go and ztypes_linux_ppc64.go to fix the EpollEvent structure on these GOARCHes along with the change in types_linux.go.  Trying to use the file generation scripts result in changes unrelated to this problem and introduce incompatibilities.  I can open a new issue for the file generation problem if that is what should be done.",
