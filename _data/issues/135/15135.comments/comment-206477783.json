In particular I think the names of the padding fields has a habit of changing and there may be constants added/removed/changed.\r\n\r\n\u003e But if I run that one alone it adds more changes than just to the epoll struct and removes the build tag. I see that the mkpost.go change was recent so I tried without that and got a lot more changes to the file.\r\n\r\nI don't think you should see any fewer changes because of mkpost.go. It should only do 'gofmt' on ppc64.  It would be nice to add the build tag generation to it.  I think these been added manually: https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/10113/",
