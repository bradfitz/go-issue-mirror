I tried just running the script and it changed multiple files and even the only file I cared about had extra changes unrelated to my change in types_linux.go.  In addition, it removed all the +build ppc64le tags in the generated z files which I believe must be there.  So what I did was just manually update the one file that mattered.  \r\n\r\nI just realized I still need to add the ppc64 change....  will do that now.",
