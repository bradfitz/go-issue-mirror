If they call\nnew(T) and it doesn't go on the stack, that should add exactly 1.0 to AllocsPerRun in\npackage testing.\n\nYou are writing \"Mallocs[\" but you mean \"BySize[\".\n\nThe runtime needs to track two more numbers: total number of tiny blocks allocated, and\ntotal number of tiny allocations from those blocks. Then it can either expose them as\nnew fields in MemStats or it can adjust the overall MemStats.Mallocs (here I mean\nMallocs, not BySize) by adding TinyAllocs - TinyBlocks before returning the stats.\u003c/pre\u003e",
