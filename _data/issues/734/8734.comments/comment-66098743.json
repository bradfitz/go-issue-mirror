But that's an\ninconvenient name, so it's called \"AllocsPerRun\".\n\nUsers don't care how memory was allocated. testing.AllocsPerRun is 99% of the time about\nlocking in heap allocation behavior. Whether that's heap-in-slab or heap-in-tiny is\nirrelevant.\n\nIf the cost of incrementing a counter is expensive, it only has to be done while\ntesting.AllocsPerRun is active (only in tests).\u003c/pre\u003e",
