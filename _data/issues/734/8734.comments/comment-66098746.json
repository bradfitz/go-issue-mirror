We run the thing\n100 times or something like that and then divide by 100. All the things that happen\nsignificantly less than once per run get rounded away. What's left is the consistent\nallocations. Except that the tiny-alloc code path is breaking that. The code path needs\nto be changed to keep AllocsPerRun working.\n\nDmitriy, are you willing to fix this? If not, let me know and I will reassign the bug\nand fix it myself.\u003c/pre\u003e",
