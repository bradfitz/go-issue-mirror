All the\nthings that happen significantly less than once per run get rounded away.\n\nWhen you divide by 100 and round down, you eliminate not just everything that happens\nsignificantly less than once per run. You eliminate everything that did not happen in at\nleast one run.\nIf that was the intention that we need to add 0.9 before rounding down. By the way, the\nrounding logic was introduced to mask another implementation detail -- episodic\nallocations in settype.  Settype allocations were indeed rare, and they have gone.\n\nI can't fix this issue, because I don't understand what you want to measure. Feel free\nto reassign to yourself.\u003c/pre\u003e",
