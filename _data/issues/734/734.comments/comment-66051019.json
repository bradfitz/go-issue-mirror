I'll never remember which one is ZB and which is ZX.\nMaybe the formats should be \"Z0700\" and \"Z07:00\"?\n\nI don't think there's a need for OldISO8601.  The code I've written using\nISO8601 was really trying to be RFC3339 and only ever dealt with UTC times.\n\nISO8601 = \"...\"  // ISO 8601 basic format\nRFC3339 = \"...\"  // RFC 3339\u003c/pre\u003e",
