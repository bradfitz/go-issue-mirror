I don't know of a clean, simple, portable cross-process semaphore.\r\n\r\nLocalhost TCP? Later: multi-machine TCP and making cmd/compile and cmd/link use a VFS (and network impls) rather than the os package for file access. Imagining running a large build on a cloud machine and cmd/go spinning up some helper Kubernetes (or whatever) containers to speed the build, then going away when the build is done, paying for them by the number of seconds they were running.\r\n",
