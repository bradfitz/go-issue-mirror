	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe Pkg() methods of all implementations of types.Object (named entities) return the\npackage that declared that entity... except one.  PkgName's Pkg method returns the\nobject that is imported.  For example:\n\npackage main\nimport foo \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\nvar _ foo.Stringer\n\nThe object 'foo' is a PkgName, whose Pkg() returns not \u0026quot;main\u0026quot; but\n\u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;.  This is lossy, since it's impossible to get from foo to\n\u0026quot;main\u0026quot; via the API, and inconsistent with all other objects, making it much\nharder for clients to use.  (Essentially, they must pass around a pair of (*Package,\nObject) in lieu of Object because the Pkg() method is not to be trusted.)\n\nI think PkgName should have a new method, ImportedPackage() that returns the package\nthat was imported, as distinct from the importing package that logically contains the\nidentifier.\n\n(go/ssa and oracle will need to be audited, among others.  If you send me a CL for\ngo/types, I'll take care of the rest.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
