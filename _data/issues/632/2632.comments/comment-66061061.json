For\ninstance: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/-AI1pPNIwW\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/-AI1pPNIwW\u003c/a\u003e shows the addresses are different, even\nthough their backing contents are the same.\n\nYou really need unsafe to determine whether two strings alias the same memory.\n\nBut \u0026lt;/tangent\u0026gt;, yes: the strconv package would have to take care to not retain its\ninput strings, even in error messages.  And we'd need to write tests to guarantee that\nstrconv never regresses and starts allocating. But that's easy and we do that in a\nnumber of other packages.\u003c/pre\u003e",
