	"body": "I'm running into high allocations converting []byte to string to use with the ParseXXX functions. However, I also agree that we shouldn't add new functions just to handle bytes.\r\n\r\nAccording to ```gcflags=-m```, the ParseXXX functions leak the input str to err. Unfortunately, this means that ParseBool(string(bytes)) incurs an allocation.\r\n\r\nGiven that errors are expected to be rare, maybe we could copy the input string in the error message. This way, the escape analysis can properly conclude that the input str does not escape.\r\n\r\nThe advantage is that ParseBool(string(bytes)) will incur no extra allocations.\r\nThe disadvantage is that every time an error occurs, a copy of the input is being made (the string could potentially be very large). If the input truly was a string, then this copy was unnecessary.",
