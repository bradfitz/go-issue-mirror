See the Bugs\nsection at the bottom of \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json\u003c/a\u003e:\n\nThis package ignores anonymous (embedded) struct fields during\nencoding and decoding. A future version may assign meaning to them. To\nforce an anonymous field to be ignored in all future versions of this\npackage, use an explicit `json:\"-\"` tag in the struct definition.\n\nIn Go 1.1, your example will work the way you expect. We just didn't\nhave time to make that work for Go 1.0. It's working that way at tip\nright now.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
