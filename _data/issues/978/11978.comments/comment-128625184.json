It is impossible at the library layer to know if it is safe to retry a query.\r\n\r\nThe [driver documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/driver/) sayeth the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nErrBadConn should be returned by a driver to signal to the sql package\r\nthat a driver.Conn is in a bad state (such as the server having earlier\r\nclosed the connection) and the sql package should retry on a new\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nTo prevent duplicate operations, ErrBadConn should NOT be returned\r\nif there's a possibility that the database server might have performed\r\nthe operation. Even if the server sends back an error, you shouldn't\r\nreturn ErrBadConn.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this test case results in duplicate operations, it's the driver that's at fault, not database/sql's.  Not a bug.",
