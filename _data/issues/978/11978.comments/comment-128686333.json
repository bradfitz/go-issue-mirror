	"body": "Under what conditions could an Exec or Query correctly return ErrBadConn?\r\n\r\nOnce the query command is written to the socket, the driver has to consider that the query could have been executed. The only way it can safely assert that the query did not execute is if it receives a query failure response from the database server -- but if it receives a query failure message then the connection would still be usable -- so ErrBadConn would not be appropriate.\r\n\r\nSo it really seems the only situation where ErrBadConn is the correct response is on an error prior to socket write.\r\n\r\nI suppose the driver can be blamed, but it feels like retry on Query and Exec is a foot-gun waiting to happen -- for minimal convenience improvement. This is not a theoretical assertion either, both drivers I tested, [pq](https://github.com/lib/pq) and my own [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx), trigger this undesirable behaviour.",
