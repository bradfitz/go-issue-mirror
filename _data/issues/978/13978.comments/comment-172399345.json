Alternatively, I guess, you could disable go's handling of SIGSEGV entirely.\r\n\r\nAs to figuring out why you're jumping into the weeds, I guess if you're lucky you're jumping via CALL and the address you jumped from is on the top of the stack. If not, you might still be able to figure out where you were in the code by looking through the stack, though of course if the jump is from runtimeÂ·gogo or something like that this won't help.",
