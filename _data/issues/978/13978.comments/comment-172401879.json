It hasn't encountered the SIGSEGV yet, but all other periodic code paths should have been exercised a few hundred times.\r\n\r\nWe can run the process under gdb, though it may take a day before we see the crash again. Disabling Go's SIGSEGV handling to force an immediate core dump sounds attractive. Can this be done via `signal.Ignore(syscall.SIGSEGV)`, or does it require calling sigaction(2) directly?",
