This could introduce memory corruption in \"os\" test binary.\r\n\r\nWe can avoid `binary.LittleEndian` by unsafe hack (e.g `*(*uint32)(unsafe.Pointer(\u0026bs[0])) = uint32(10), or cast to some struct`) \r\non windows PC, that is what we done in syscall package. But yes, unsafe is unsafe...\r\n\r\n\u003eI would leave test for go1.8. But feel free to send a CL yourself - if others want to proceed with it, I will help along too.\r\n\r\nI see. It's bigger test than I expected, which mean, it contains unknown bugs, potentially.\r\n\r\n\u003eThanks again. I will stop thinking about this bug now. :-)\r\n\r\nThank you for your confirmations. :)",
