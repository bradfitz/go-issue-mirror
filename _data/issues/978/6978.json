	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eCurrently, the documentation on os.File.Seek mentions:\n\nSeek sets the offset for the next Read or Write on file to offset, interpreted according\nto whence: 0 means relative to the origin of the file, 1 means relative to the current\noffset, and 2 means relative to the end.\n\nIt leads people to write things like file.Seek(0, 2) which is in my opinion, not that\nreadable, especially when you don't know where those numbers come from.\n\nI believe it would be better if the following os constants were mentioned instead:\n * SEEK_SET\n * SEEK_CUR\n * SEEK_END\u003c/pre\u003e",
