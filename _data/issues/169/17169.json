I compile it on OS X 10.11.6 (x68_64) and let it run on OS X 10.6.8 (i386). With Go 1.6.x, there was no problem, after I upgraded to Go 1.7.1 I could still compile my service but no longer run it on OS X 10.6.8 (but can run it on OS X 10.11)\r\n\r\nI reduced the code to a [minimal service](https://play.golang.org/p/Bw0LmLGwTh) which reproduces the problem. I tried to reproduce the problem without using Gizmo but to no avail yet. I'll update the issue once I find a \"pure\" Go solution since I think that the problem is not related to Gizmo specifically.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nI expected that recompiling my Gizmo-based service using Go 1.7.1 would still run on OS X 10.6.8 despite #10403. I read through the release notes for Go 1.7 and did not find any hint that OS X 10.6.8 or any 32-bit OS X platform for that matter is no longer supported.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\nWhen I try to start the executable, I get this\r\n```shell\r\ndyld: Symbol not found: _SecCertificateCopyNormalizedSubjectContent\r\n  Referenced from: /Users/robert/./test\r\n  Expected in: flat namespace\r\n\r\nTrace/BPT trap\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
