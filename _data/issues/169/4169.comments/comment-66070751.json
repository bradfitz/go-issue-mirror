So you can literally do something like this:\n\ntype Envelope struct {\n    Header\n    Body\n}\n\ntype Body struct {\n    Response interface{}\n}\n\nAny tag (with any name) will be filled into the \"Response\" interface that is registered.\nIt takes the tag name in the document and does a name lookup of the type.\n\nIn that register function it allows you to add type attributes. Looks something like\nthis:\n\nxmlutil.RegisterTypeMore(RunTransaction{}, xml.Name{}, []xml.Attr{...});\n\nIt does almost the same thing as the encoding/xml marshal/unmarshal, but doesn't support\nthe \"\u003e\" tag keyword. I found that the \"\u003e\" keyword made things really complicated.\n\nNot sure if it would be useful to you guys or not. I hope to open source it soon, just\nhave to get approval.\u003c/pre\u003e",
