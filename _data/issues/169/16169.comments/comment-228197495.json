My immediate idea was to start simple with instrumentation like `m := benchmarker()` and then calls to `m.mark(\"parse\")`, `m.mark(\"typecheck\")`, etc. appropriately scattered around.  If you have anything more thought out I'm all ears. :)\r\n\r\nAs for format, one of my takeaways from @aclements' presentation about github.com/aclements/go-gg was that the [benchmark format](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/14313-benchmark-format.md) may be sufficient as long as we adequately structure the benchmark names.  E.g., see the examples with names like `BenchmarkDecode/text:digits/level:speed/size:1e4/gomaxprocs:8`.\r\n\r\n/cc @aclements for thoughts on data format",
