	"body": "Yes. Funny coincidence, I spent this morning experimenting with adding structured statistics code to the front-end. This is an item on my TODOs.\r\n\r\nMy thinking at the moment:\r\n- There's the notion of a Measurement (an interface, abstracts over a time/duration, count, or other measure).\r\n- There are Groups, which collect multiple Measurements. Depending on what it is, it may accumulate/average the data.\r\n- There are individual Measurements, such as timings, counts. etc.\r\n\r\nThe hierarchy permits collecting a lot of data in a structured (and labeled) way. The code augmentation is typically a single extra line per start/stop event.\r\n\r\nA single \"print\" at the end of the compile dumps the output in a structured form.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that there should be a JSON variant for dumping the data to a file so that I can be processed later (i.e., so we can collect the data across many runs/times/versions and then produce graphs).",
