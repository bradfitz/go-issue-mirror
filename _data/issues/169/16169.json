	"body": "Right now we can use compilebench to measure the compiler's overall run time, and we can use -cpuprofile to measure fine-grained per-function/instruction profiles.  But with the interest in continuing to evolve/rewrite individual phases of the compiler, I think it would be nice to track the compiler's performance on a per-phase granularity.\r\n\r\nRough proposal sketch:\r\n\r\n  1. Add a flag to cmd/compile like -phasebench=prefix:outfile.\r\n  2. Add instrumentation to cmd/compile/internal/gc/main.go so that when phasebench is enabled, it will append [benchmark data formatted](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/14313-benchmark-format.md) entries to outfile of the form \"prefix-parse\", \"prefix-typecheck\", etc.\r\n  3. compilebench can then optionally make use of this new flag, and we can start tracking the more detailed information.",
