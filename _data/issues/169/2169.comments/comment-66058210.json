At the time I had other things to do so I just moved on. Second time\nI just assumed it was some nonsense \"Chromium\" was outputting. It wasn't until about a\nweek ago when I was casually reading through the http code that I came upon it - by\naccident - I was amazed.\n\nI wasn't sure if that was a bug or not until last night I tried communicating with the\nserver via ajax and found it doesn't work properly because of the added text(of-course I\ncould just use json but then I'd encounter it again somewhere else).\u003c/pre\u003e",
