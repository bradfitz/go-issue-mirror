The real 'expected behavior' here is\nthat when you print an error, it shows up in the browser window.\nThe padding makes that happen reliably.  If we're padding for a\nbrowser that doesn't need it, I'd be happy to change the rule.\n\nIf you pad with spaces then people writing servers are left scratching\ntheir heads about where the spaces came from with no good way to\nfind out.  On the other hand, padding with the string we chose makes\nit very easy to do a search to find out where it came from: you had\nno trouble tracking down the source of the message.\u003c/pre\u003e",
