	"body": "\u003e Perhaps it's worth considering overloading the make builtin for maps to take an optional hash.Hash interface argument that allows the developer to override the default hashing algorithm with whatever hashing algorithm they want?\r\n\r\nThat does not sound like a good thing to do, IMHO. Maps should work bets for the most generic cases, anything else can be implemented elsewhere. I am not a crypto expert but I think this issue is about finding a way to improve maps in generic cases -- not adding special ones. ",
