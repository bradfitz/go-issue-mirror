	"body": "Currently, `go tool cover-html=coverage.out` appears to use `xdg-open` on Linux, which doesn't always select the right browser. Even if the `$BROWSER` environment variable is set, the cover tool doesn't always select the right browser. \r\n\r\nFiguring out the right browser to open is tricky, and even `xdg-open` doesn't always get this right. It'd therefore be helpful if the cover tool either accepts a flag to specify the browser, and/or perhaps use the `$BROWSER` environment variable if defined.\r\n\r\n(This is related to #10259 in that the fix is probably the same, but it affects the coverage tool too.)",
