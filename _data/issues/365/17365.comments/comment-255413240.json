I think we should have the goal of Go running on Linux-on-Windows, and we should invest (some) time in debugging problems with that configuration. If the problem is caused by our code, we should change our code. If the problem is a bug in the Windows kernel, we should file a bug upstream and not work around it in Go. Likely most/all of the test failures are kernel bugs, but we should at least do the debugging to find out what the kernel bugs are so we can file issues upstream.",
