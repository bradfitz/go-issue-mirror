At least, not in the general\ncase.\n\ngoimport's fast path doesn't do any on-disk lookups or parsing of Go code to figure out\nwhether an import was used.\n\nAnswering this question for the example given would require we lookup all the symbols in\n\"os\".  Fortunately we do keep the standard library in memory, so it's possible we could\nat least support this feature for some packages.\n\nBut:\n\n*) I don't like doing this \".\" magic for some packages (stdlib) and not others.  (Why\nwouldn't this work for dot imports of unit tests in your own packages?)\n\n*) dot imports are weird and discouraged anyway.  I prefer the existing behavior of just\nalways keeping them.  Once a dot import is there, it's unlikely it's ever going away\n(it's in a test package testing your internals, so surely you're not just deleting all\nyour tests and leaving only the imports, right?)\n\nIf you disagree or have a less contrived example that actually bit you, we could re-open\nor fix in a different way.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
