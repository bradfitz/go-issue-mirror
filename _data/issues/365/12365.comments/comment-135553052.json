The IANA is in charge of LOTS of numbers (http://www.iana.org/protocols). If this package doesn't have all the numbers, then it is not well named. If it does have all the numbers, then I fear it will become unnavigable, perhaps worse even than syscall. Either choice seems like a serious problem.\r\n\r\nI think it might make more sense for now just to paste the numbers into the packages that need them, as unexported constants. Three packages is not that many.\r\n\u003c/q\u003e\r\n",
