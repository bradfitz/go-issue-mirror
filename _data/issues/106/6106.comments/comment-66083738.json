In the case of\n'interface{}' typed keys, there are probably three things that must be checked _at\nruntime_: \n\n- If both \"sides\" of the cmp are of same types.\n- If that type has '==' defined. ([]slices do not, for example)\n- If the values are equal or not, but only using a dynamically dispatched \"comparator\"\n(a function call, I guess).\n\nIf you compare this to the single instruction that the compiler can emit for comparing\ntwo integers, the 10 times slowdown seems to me not surprising at all.\u003c/pre\u003e",
