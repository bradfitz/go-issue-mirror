It works on go 1.2 using gdb compiled with python 2 and\npython 3. pretty printing of slices and maps works.\nThe $len and $cap function works on slices and maps.\n I'm wondering if this patch is worth submitting for inclusion into a point release of go1.2 and/or a building block for go1.3.\n\nHere's an example:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/n2L68VzRen\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/n2L68VzRen\u003c/a\u003e\nI download as foo.go and build as:\ngo build foo.go\n\nHere's the output using go1.2 and gdb 7.6 (which is linked against python3) (only\nshowing relevant portions).\nThe output is identical for go1.2 and gdb 7.4 (linked against python2.7) because I\nadjusted the script to be\nmore compatible with python 2 and 3.\n\n----\nBreakpoint 1, main.main () at /home/shane/foo.go:9\n9\t\tfmt.Println(\"Hello, world\", x, y, z)\n(gdb) p x\n$1 = map[string]string = {[\"shane\"] = \"hansen\"}\n(gdb) p y\n$2 =  []int = {1, 2, 3}\n(gdb) p z\n$3 =  []string = {\"shane\", \"hansen\"}\n(gdb) p $len(x)\n$4 = 1\n(gdb) p $len(y)\n$5 = 3\n(gdb) p $len(z)\n$6 = 2\n\n----\u003c/pre\u003e",
