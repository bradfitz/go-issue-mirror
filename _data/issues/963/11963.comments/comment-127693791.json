When pressing PageUp or PageDown (no Ctrl) I get to navigate through the slides of the tour, while if use Ctrl+PageUp or Ctrl+PageDown I get to navigate through the tabs open on my navigator.\r\n\r\nThis is the expected behavior, are you seeing a different one? If so: please explain with more detail.\r\n\r\nThanks",
