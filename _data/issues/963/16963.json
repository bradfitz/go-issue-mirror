	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n1.7\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nAll\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\n\r\nIf I write a Go file with go/printer.Fprintf, structs get printed like this - I've replaced the tab characters with `\\t` so it's clear what is going on.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype User struct{\r\n\\tName\\t\\tstring\r\n\\tLongConfig\\tuint\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you immediately run `go fmt ./...` on the file, some of the tabs are replaced by spaces:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype User struct{\r\n\\tName        string\r\n\\tLongConfig  uint\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`go/printer.Fprintf` uses the following default printer.Config argument: \r\n\r\n```go\r\nreturn (\u0026Config{Tabwidth: 8}).Fprint(output, fset, node)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `go fmt` uses this config argument:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nconst (\r\n\ttabWidth    = 8\r\n\tprinterMode = printer.UseSpaces | printer.TabIndent\r\n)\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nres, err := format(fileSet, file, sourceAdj, indentAdj, src, printer.Config{Mode: printerMode, Tabwidth: tabWidth})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nI expect the two \"default\" functions to print the file the same way\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nOne prints with tabs in the middle and one doesn't. This led to a lot of thrash when running anything automated over the codebase; I noticed this first as part of the investigation for https://github.com/Shyp/bump_version/pull/1.\r\n\r\nFar more people run `go fmt` than write AST parsing/hacking functions, so it seems like the fix, if there is to be one, should be to have `printer.Fprintf` match the `go fmt` behavior.\r\n",
