	"body": "@kevinburke I agree there's a discrepancy.\r\n\r\nThe intention behind the printer's default settings was to produce tab-aligned output. gofmt's fine-tuning (using blanks for all alignment but indentation) came later. (There was a long period of trial and error with gofmt's settings before it eventually settled to what we have now).\r\n\r\nI'd be somewhat reluctant to change the settings here simply because I don't know how much code depends on what's here now.\r\n\r\nInstead, I'd recommend that you use go/format (format.Node) instead of printer.Fprint. It has the same signature and it supposed to produce gofmt-compliant output.\r\n\r\nIf you're ok with this answer I'll close this issue. Otherwise, please raise your objections. Thanks.",
