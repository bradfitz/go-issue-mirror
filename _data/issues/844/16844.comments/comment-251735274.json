I would typically see deprecation as frozen hoping for the ability to remove at some future time.\r\n\r\nThe complaint about https is only partly valid, I agree it is annoying to find the recipe but once found does not change much - this could be added to the examples.\r\n\r\nI agree with others that that net/rpc is lightweight fast simple and serves many scenarios well.\r\n\r\nI have not suffered from any of what @robpike refers to as \"outstanding bugs that are hard to fix,\" so would be happy for these to be migrated to documented known limitations, and avoid going to any great lengths to fix these bugs.\r\n\r\nfor the reasons @robmccoll mentions I think it would be wrong to encourage folk to use alternatives like GRPC in *place* of net/rpc and the word 'deprecate' would discourage the otherwise perfectly sensible use of this simple useful package.",
