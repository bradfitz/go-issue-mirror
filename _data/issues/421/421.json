	"body": "by **Ostsol**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003ecgo currently assumes that all binaries created through the code it \ngenerates will be in Go's package directory.  Specifically, the location \nof the .so (cbinding_cbinding.so, for example) is hard-coded into that \ndirectory.  What I propose is that cgo be given a command line option that \ndefines the installation directory for these binaries.\n\nIn cgo/ast.go, a new field should be added to type Prog named 'BinaryPath' \nor something like that.\n\ncgo/main.go should parse its arguments to determine whether a flag \ndefining the binary path has been set, and then set it to Prog's \nBinaryPath field.  By default, the field should point to Go's standard \npackage directory.\n\nThe third-last parameter of the Fprintf call on lines 65 and 135 of cgo/\nout.go should be changed to p.BinaryPath.\n\nAttached are the changed files based on the following Go revision (from \n'hg identify':\n\n683ed10f7832+ tip\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/421/0/cgo.tar.gz\"\u003ecgo.tar.gz\u003c/a\u003e (10079 bytes)",
