Please ask questions in  a forum instead; see https://golang.org/wiki/Questions .\r\n\r\nIn your first example `a.Fp1` works because the address of `a` is implicitly taken, making this identical to `(\u0026a).Fp1`.  See https://golang.org/ref/spec#Calls : \"If x is addressable and \u0026x's method set contains m, x.m() is shorthand for (\u0026x).m().\"  This does not help with your second example, because this shorthand does not apply when using reflection.\r\n\r\nClosing as this is not a bug.",
