	"body": "`isDomainName` also falsely rejects wildcard domains like `*.golang.org`, see results in #17549. The bottom line, as pointed out six years ago in #1168, is that the function is far too restrictive for DNS lookups (as opposed to hostname connections). It should accept all strings that are valid DNS names per RFC 1035, including those with non-LDH labels, and should probably also accept strings that are valid per RFC 6762 (which allows up to 256 wire-format octets for \".local\" domainsâ€”you might even opt to allow that many for _all_ domains, even though 255 is the interoperability limit for public DNS).",
