	"body": "Because,\r\n    \r\n* The CGI spec defines that incoming request header \"Foo: Bar\" maps to environment variable HTTP_FOO == \"Bar\". (see RFC 3875 4.1.18)\r\n                \r\n* The HTTP_PROXY environment variable is conventionally used to configure the HTTP proxy for HTTP clients (and is respected by default for Go's net/http.Client and Transport)\r\n        \r\nThat means Go programs running in a CGI environment (as a child process under a CGI host) are vulnerable to an incoming request containing \"Proxy: attacker.com:1234\", setting HTTP_PROXY, and changing where Go by default proxies all outbound HTTP requests.\r\n    \r\nThis is CVE-2016-5386, aka https://httpoxy.org/\r\n",
