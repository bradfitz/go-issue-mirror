The successful ones are on the order of two to ten samples, despite running for 5 seconds. There's some distribution around that, so sometimes it gets zero samples.\r\n\r\nThis failure requires all three of GOGC=1, TestStackBarrierProfiling, and arm. On arm, without GOGC=1 or with TestMathBigDivide, we get ~100 samples (which is still ~5x less than expected, but at least it isn't almost zero). On amd64, the test gets 600â€“700 samples.",
