It might also have been backported to the distribution/kernel you're using. One way to find out if your kernel supports this is to test for it (see below).\r\n\r\nA Go package for seccomp support was added recently to ChromiumOS tree: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/go-seccomp/\r\n\r\nThe package includes a CheckSupport() function to check for seccomp-tsync support in the kernel.\r\nSee the main package file for details: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/go-seccomp/+/master/src/chromiumos/seccomp/seccomp.go\r\n",
