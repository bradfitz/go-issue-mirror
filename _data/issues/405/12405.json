	"body": "liblink rewrites `MOV $0, r` to `XOR r, r`. MOV does not impact flags, but XOR does. As a result, this rewrite is not generally safe. This was the source of a bug in the SSA branch (see CL 14042 and 14043). It could also impact hand-written assembly. It is an accident of the current backend codegen that it doesn't cause bugs now.\r\n\r\nWe should remove the liblink rewrite and generate `XOR r, r` directly if/when that is desired. For example, for the existing backend, this could become part of the peephole optimizer; we can update the existing handwritten assembly.\r\n\r\ncc @bradfitz @tzneal @randall77 \r\n",
