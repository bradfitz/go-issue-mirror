In this case, the load instruction is labelled with the line number of the spill (unlike the general case where it is labelled with the line number of the use). Maybe we should assign the line number based on its use as well?\r\n\r\nHowever, the use information seems not carried to this step. I will see how simple to add it.\r\n ",
