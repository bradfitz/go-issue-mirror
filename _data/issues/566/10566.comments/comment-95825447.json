Secondly, should we differentiate openbsd in case that resolve.conf doesn't exist if we fix in dns_config?  If we don't, regular builds will behave because Brad's change detects this.  However people who build with netgo in openbsd would get the Linux behavior.  If nobody else is working on it already, I can shoot a fix over tomorrow pending thoughts on the above.",
