It is second program (that I know of) that behaves this way - first one is cmd.exe (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/twistylittlepassagesallalike/2011/04/23/everyone-quotes-command-line-arguments-the-wrong-way/).\r\n\r\nThe Go exec.Command escaping will work if child program reads its arguments with CommandLineToArgv. And most programs doo. But cmd.exe and msiexec.exe do not. So you have to use Cmd.SysProcAttr.CmdLine to build command line by hand. And you do that already. I don't see what else you could do.\r\n\r\nAlex",
