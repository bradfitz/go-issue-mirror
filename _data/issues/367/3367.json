	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eA client can use the server name indication TLS extension to specify the desired\nhostname of the server certificate used in the TLS handshake. Go supports this SNI\nextension in server connections with the tls.Config struct's NameToCertificate member\nand BuildNameToCertificate function. These are used in the server connection's handshake\nimplementation to lookup a certificate which may not be the default certificate used by\nthe server. In such case, the key exchange functionality will still use the default\ncertificate's private key.\n\nThe linked code sample demonstrates this problem when the client recieve a \u0026quot;remote\nerror: bad record MAC\u0026quot; error during handshake. The included patch fixes this error\nby keeping track of the non-default certificate's private key in the key exchange struct.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/2151037\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/2151037\u003c/a\u003e\n\ngo run sni_test.go\n\nWhat is the expected output?\n\nthe program should exit 0\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n\na \u0026quot;remote error: bad record MAC\u0026quot; panic\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n\nOSX\n\nWhich revision are you using?
