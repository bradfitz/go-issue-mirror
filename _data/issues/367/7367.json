	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. extract zip with freetype.syso and main.go into $GOPATH/src/cgofreetype\n2. $ go install cgofreetype\n3. cmd/ld won't link the executable successfully using tip (but does with Go 1.2).\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe program should successfully link (it does with Go 1.2 but not with tip).\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n$ go install cgofreetype\n\n# cgofreetype\n/usr/bin/ld: errno: TLS reference in /var/tmp/go-link-bBiYJF/000001.o mismatches non-TLS\nreference in /var/tmp/go-link-bBiYJF/go.o\n/var/tmp/go-link-bBiYJF/go.o: could not read symbols: Bad value\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n/home/stephen/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/6l: running gcc failed: unsuccessful exit status\n0x100\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6l\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\n$ uname -a\nLinux stephen-N5110 3.2.0-58-generic #88-Ubuntu SMP Tue Dec 3 17:37:58 UTC 2013 x86_64\nx86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nWhich version are you using?

There is NO\nwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\nUpon further inspection myself it seems that GCC's ld can't link because of the fact\nthat 000001.o (freetype.syso) contains errno which uses thread-local storage and go.o\nwhich doesn't use thread-local storage ? I can't dig up more than this through Google.\n\nI'm reporting this bug because the same program does link OK with Go 1.2, but I'm open\nto ideas and workarounds regarding this issue if anyone can offer them.\n\nI've attached a zip with all necessary files to reproduce the issue on linux/amd64.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/7367/0/cgofreetype.zip\"\u003ecgofreetype.zip\u003c/a\u003e (3996625 bytes)",
