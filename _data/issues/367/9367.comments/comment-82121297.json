If they guess wrong, they will realize much later that they have to go back and redo a lot of prior computation. That is very slow: something like 20 instructions wasted on a modern Intel CPU. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor\r\n\r\nFor speed, then, it would be better for the compilers to avoid conditional jumps for bool-to-int conversion.",
