In this\ncase, a struct is being sent and an interface is requested for the decode. This program\nis therefore incorrect and in general cannot easily be made to work since the sender has\nnot explained the required interface specification in the stream.\n\nOpen to suggestions:\n1) document this property better\n2) provide better error message (although all the information is in the existing\nmessage, it could always be clearer)\n3) possibly make it work in cases where it can, specifically an empty interface\nreceiver. I do not favor this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
