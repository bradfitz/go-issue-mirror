The\neffort spent improving tooling benefits users and developers and there is less tooling\nto maintain.  This is also true for data structures used by the runtime.\n\nI am not sure about needing to subset the language to implement the runtime.  While\nruntime code might be constrained in what features can be used, this is true whether it\nis written in a high- or low-level language.\u003c/pre\u003e",
