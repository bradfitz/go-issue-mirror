It's also different across languages.\r\n\r\nA Proto method to generate a proto might be okay, though that should be decided across languages too. There might be something suitable for gRPC traces, but note that x/net/trace isn't RPC-specific either.\r\n\r\nI didn't jump to a quick conclusion. I've been thinking about this code for several years. I just revised my previous thinking on the matter. I don't think there's much in the way of trace-specific information in the trace; all its content comes from outside the package, so those places can simply record the information in a different place too.",
