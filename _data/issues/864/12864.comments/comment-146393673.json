	"body": "Yes, all of the trace content comes from outside of the trace package, but `x/net/trace` is a synchronization point. Outputting the trace content to two (or more) systems seems wasteful and burdensome. Already grpc has to create a new context to store the trace in. If there is some other tracing mechanism for outputting to a log would grpc have to create another context (using `context.WithValue`) for that trace? And every grpc user would have to know to output their trace info to both places?\r\n\r\nHow do I (as a user of grpc and x/net/trace) get access to the trace content that grpc has stored in a trace? Punting the problem to grpc feels like a non-starter to me so I didn't even consider it. Do you think the Go grpc folks would be open to adding instrumentation points for gathering trace content?",
