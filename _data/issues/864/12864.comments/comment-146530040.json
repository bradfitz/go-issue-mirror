	"body": "grpc/grpc-go#240 is asking for instrumentation hooks in gRPC for metrics monitoring. That's not what I'm after. grpc/grpc-go#335 is asking for something akin to BINARY_INFO logs. Again, not what I'm after.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for something like BINARY_TRACE logs (though perhaps not binary). That is, output of RPC trace info and application-level annotations added to traces (created via `LazyLog` and `LazyPrintf`). A `Trace.String` method might not be the appropriate way to expose this data, but I think it deserves to be exposed. Along with whatever mechanism there is to serialize a trace, there would also need to be a hook or some mechanism to know when a trace is finished. Since I'm interested in traces finished by gRPC, that hook or mechanism potentially lives there, but I think the serialize of `Traces` has to live in `x/net/trace`.\r\n\r\nBtw, in case it isn't clear, I'm willing to implement this if you give guidance on what you find palatable.
