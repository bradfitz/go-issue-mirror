	"body": "When using `net/http/httputil` ReverseProxy where the upstream server is, for example, refusing connections the HTTP status code returned is `StatusInternalServerError`. It would be more appropriate (and helpful to the client) to return `StatusBadGateway`.\r\n\r\nLooking at the underlying code for http.Transport, it looks like there is no way to differentiate between the two classes of error at the moment.",
