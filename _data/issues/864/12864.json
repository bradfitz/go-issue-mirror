	"body": "Currently, the only way to view a trace is to visit the `/debug/requests` endpoint. This is nice, though impermanent. An application might want to log a trace for a slow request for a more permanent record. I'd like to add `Trace.String()` as a mechanism for doing this along with `Trace.SensitiveString()`. Alternately, a single `Trace.LogString(sensitive bool)` could suffice.",
