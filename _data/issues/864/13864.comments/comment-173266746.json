Unfortunately, the traceback on the system stack cut off at the morestack right at the top because that's *normally* the right thing to do, but it hid whatever was overflowing the system stack.\r\n\r\n@mikioh, are you able to reproduce this? If so, could you try https://go-review.googlesource.com/18761, which should fix #13363 (but I suspect won't fix this).",
