We have good reasons for requiring Gerrit, which have been hashed out a few times on the mailing list.  Given that we don't accept pull requests, it seems better to let people know that, rather than just ignore them.  If you have any suggestions for better phrasing for the automated message, I would very much appreciate it.  Thanks.",
