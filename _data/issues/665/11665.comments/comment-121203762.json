	"body": "No weird stuff (OS X firewall turned off, no VPN, no odd apps to track internet usage). However I do have a slightly unusual DNS setup; I have an `/etc/resolver/\u003cinternal-company-domain\u003e` with a search path and an internal DNS server in it, that is not reachable unless I'm on the required network. This does mean unqualified names that don't actually exist in any of the earlier search paths get tried in that direction, and that takes a long time since the DNS server in question is not reachable.\r\n\r\nI get a lot of this in tcpdump when running the test in question:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n13:08:33.797045 IP 172.16.32.169.65352 \u003e 192.168.6.1.53: 40700+ A? abc.\u003cinternal-company-domain\u003e. (34)\r\n13:08:33.797045 IP 172.16.32.169.56815 \u003e 192.168.6.1.53: 11779+ AAAA? abc.\u003cinternal-company-domain\u003e.

Perhaps timeout of resolving unqualified names should not really be a test failure? I get that my setup could be considered broken (although it works for me and does what I asked of it), but depending on the build hosts DNS setup seems a little fragile.\r\n",
