A very easy improvement would be to flush headers\nimmediately if expectsContinue during the initial write.\n\nOne question regarding brafitz's earlier comment, do we actually *need* to block sending\nthe body (seems ambiguous in the spec). I'd actually prefer the current behavior with\nthe added flush, as it would get a head start on sending data, and it looks like the\nclient still shuts down immediately upon a non 100-continue response.\u003c/pre\u003e",
