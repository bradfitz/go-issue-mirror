(I don't want to create a Gerrit account and learn how to use it just for this one thing not related to the project whatsoever. It seems a bit much of a requirement, but I know I'm not going to shift anyone's thinking on that issue. I just raise it, as the response to a PR outside of golang/go (where there is no standing notice that PRs are not accepted) fixing an HTML bug on *google's end* to 'piss off and go through Gerrit instead' can rub people the wrong way when they are just trying to help. It certainly did so to me. It doesn't seem like the ideal way of handling it. Remember, someone put the effort in to be *kind and helpful* – they should be treated in a befitting manner. The dismissive auto-response was very poorly received in the context.)",
