	"body": "After looking at this a little more, I am not sure that line folding is optional. You seem to think it is optional because of the use of \"may\" in the excerpt above. However, I believe that whenever they indicate requirement levels, they are capitalizing the keywords. If you notice in [RFC 2047](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2047.html), there are several instances where may is capitalized (along with other keywords). Also in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119#page-2) the keywords are capitalized (Event though it does say \"These words are often capitalized\"). So, it is suspect that it isn't capitalized in the referred to instance.",
