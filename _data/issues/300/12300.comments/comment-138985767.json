	"body": "I may be wrong, but I believe in English, while \"may\" is a \"soft\" qualifier, \"may not\" is a \"hard\" qualifier (similar as for \"can\" and \"can not\"). The RFC 2119 mentions MAY, but it doesn't mention MAY NOT, while it does mention both SHOULD and SHOULD NOT, etc. Also, in the specific RFC 2047 discussed here, there's (among others) [another fragment with \"may not\"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047#page-8), which I believe hints at the \"hard\"/\"can not\" meaning (**emphasis** added by me):\r\n\r\n\u003e Each 'encoded-word' MUST encode an integral number of octets.  The\r\n\u003e 'encoded-text' in each 'encoded-word' **must** be well-formed according\r\n\u003e to the encoding specified; the 'encoded-text' **may not** be continued in\r\n\u003e the next 'encoded-word'.  (For example, \"=?charset?Q?=?=\r\n\u003e =?charset?Q?AB?=\" would be illegal, because the two hex digits \"AB\"\r\n\u003e must follow the \"=\" in the same 'encoded-word'.)\r\n\r\nand another similar one just below it:\r\n\r\n\u003e Each 'encoded-word' **MUST** represent an integral number of characters.\r\n\u003e   A multi-octet character **may not** be split across adjacent 'encoded-\r\n\u003e   word's.",
