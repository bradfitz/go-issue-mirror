Two\nanonymous fields are considered to have the same name. Lower-case field names from\ndifferent packages are always different.\"\n\nStructs with different tags are therefore not identical and therefore not assignable.\nThis is intentional. The tags carry as much information as the field names, perhaps more.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
