I didn't read the type\ncomment closely enough to internalize that \"variable-sized\" meant \"variable-capacity\"\nnot \"variably slices a fixed-capacity buffer.\"\n\nThe following sentence in the docstring led me astray: \"If the buffer becomes too large,\nWrite will panic with ErrTooLarge.\" It is slightly unclear that the \"too large\" means\ngrowing past some undefined limit. From the (incorrect) frame of thought that Buffer is\nfixed-capacity, I read this as \"don't exceed the fixed capacity or it'll panic.\"\n\nYes, in hindsight this is a totally bogus way to interpret it. But I actually coded\naround this (perceived) limitation. So I filed this bug with the hope to improve the\ndocs so no one else makes the same mistake.\n\n\nMaybe a one-word change to the panic phrasing would improve it:\n\n\"If the buffer grows too large, Write will panic with ErrTooLarge.\"\n\n\nIn that wording at least \"grow\" is mentioned in the docstring of the function that most\noften grows the buffer.\u003c/pre\u003e",
