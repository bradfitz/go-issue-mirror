	"body": "reflect.Value already allows efficient emulation of range semantics for arrays, slices, strings, and channels, so a fully generic range-like operation is unnecessary.  It need only work for maps.\r\n\r\nThere's an argument for making it generic for consistency's sake, but I think it's pretty weak.  For arrays, slices, and channels, range is only syntactic sugar, which doesn't provide the same value in reflect.  Even if there were a generic range operation, I would still favor the existing Len/Index methods for ranging arrays and slices and the Recv method for ranging a channel.",
