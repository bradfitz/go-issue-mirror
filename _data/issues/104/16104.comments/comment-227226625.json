This is the way most other tools, including `git` work.\r\n\r\nHowever you could probably set the environment variable `GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -o ControlMaster=no'`.\r\nBut this seems like it might be a bit too specific of a fix. It's possible the user might have a git hook, or something else which also launches a background process with stderr still open. Though maybe this is rare enough that we just ignore the issue.",
