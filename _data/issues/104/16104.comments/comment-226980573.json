Just a guess.\r\n\r\nNot the case.\r\n1. When `go get` is hung, `ps` shows it has no child processes. \r\n2. I have the ssh fingerprint for github.\r\n3. It hangs after the repo is cloned as `$GOPATH/src/github.com/influxdata/telegraf` exists, with all the source files.\r\n\r\n*(and just for clarification, this happens with all repos, not just this one)*",
