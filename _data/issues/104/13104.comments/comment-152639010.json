But having\nOS-specific *APIs* is highly undesirable, and is devastating for\napplication portability.  (Indeed, this problem is exactly why things like\nPOSIX and the standard C APIs exist …)\n\nSo while the location is not terribly important to me — especially if it is\njust base functionality like termio handling, if the location means that\nits likely that the APIs will not be compatible across different ports, I\nconsider that a failure.\n\nOn Fri, Oct 30, 2015 at 12:50 PM, Jens Frederich \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e\nwrote:\n\n\u003e I quite agree like Brad x/os.\n\u003e\n\u003e —\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/13104#issuecomment-152635342\u003e.\n\u003e\n",
