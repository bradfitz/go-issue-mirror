GetConsoleMode() and SetConsoleMode() are the functions I'd\r\nprobably want to use when building this Windows analog.\r\n\r\nWinAPI contains stateless getch() and kbhit() functions that are more clean and I think more useful. See this implementation in Python\r\nhttps://bitbucket.org/techtonik/python-pager/src/2936adb19c9407b8e890949f9e88bf4f0461a524/pager.py?at=default\u0026fileviewer=file-view-default#pager.py-190\r\n\r\nStill there is a big problem how to get exact keycode indifferent of language layout and encoding. Something kind of readKey() function. For some reason I think it is impossible on Linux, but it would be nice if Go could provide an interface for that once kernel is patched to forward that information to active user space process.",
