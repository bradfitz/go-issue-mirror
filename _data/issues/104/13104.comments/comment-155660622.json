The idea of setting raw mode, disabling or enabling buffering and echo are pretty universal.  Windows consoles can offer some enhanced functionality as well but for something like the needs of ssh that is entirely unnecessary. (Extras like double buffering and mouse reporting.)\n\nI cannot think of any system which offers a prompt like interface for shell interpreters which cannot supply an implementation of these interfaces.\n\nI'd be equally happy if this were called termios and the interfaces built to emulate POSIX termios. I actually believe that for most consumers that will be the easiest and most natural API. \n\nBtw ssh does need escape sequences or anything like that.  Just low level termios support is sufficient. \n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n\u003e On Nov 10, 2015, at 5:02 PM, Rob Thornton \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e \n\u003e Naming has the feeling of long term consequences and misconstrued intent, which is the crux of this discussion.

Perhaps, like std/os, this is the right place for os specific terminal code and leave an os agnostic implementation for a separate, higher level tui package?\n\u003e \n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n\u003e \n",
