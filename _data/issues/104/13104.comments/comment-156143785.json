It's a bit of an odd mix, but it's certainly a common grouping historically. Is that list correct, @davecheney?\n\u003e \n\nNo.  Just 1 \u0026 3.  Item 2 really doesn't belong here IMHO.  It is something easily provided by a third party package like tcell.  I don't believe escape sequence handling is something the core ought to be concerning itself with.  \n\nThat said I would support the idea of *one* higher level interface being added because it's likely to be so widely used and useful as to warrant being here. That is something akin to getpassphrase() for password prompting.  Probably 90% of the most common uses for the lower stuff are based on a need to do just this.  Including btw the ssh use case. \n\n  - Garrett\n\u003e Based on the discussion here and the inability to find a better name, I think x/term is fine for this set of code. If you can confirm the scope, I'll throw my hat in with x/term and then I think there is sufficient agreement to approve the proposal. Thanks for bearing with us.\n\u003e \n\u003e â€”\n\u003e Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n\u003e \n",
