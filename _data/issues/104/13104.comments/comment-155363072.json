So that people can get the answer \"why it is not possible to get common interface\", which will lead to description of actual conflicts, which is a necessary step to rethink things, which is a source data for improving human experience with Operating Systems (http://www.worldusabilityday.org/ is in 2 days), which could explain what could be changed, which is a necessary step to design new generation of Operating Systems and a source data to implement new hardware, which can also be based on completely different principles (optics, neural networks, etc.). But somebody need to start gather a technical database of compatibility conflicts, so that every new language out there didn't waste time on the same cross-platform problems that are not related to the language itself.",
