(I also wander who uses serial ports these days). Serial port can be in a separate package, it does not need to be related to anything else.\r\n\r\nConsole input and output is something I have never done before. But I just googled and found this http://www.benryves.com/tutorials/winconsole/all - it is a start. I am not sure what you are trying to do, so take it with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nAs always I am happy to help any way I can.\r\n\r\nAlex",
