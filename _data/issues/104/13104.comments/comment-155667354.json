	"body": "I like x/console less, but can live with it.  console suggests (to anyone other than a Windows console user) a specific interface -- which can overlap with but is also orthogonal to tty handling.  (On UNIX the \"console\" is the primary login interface by default, and is also where kernel messages and high priority syslogs are usually directed; it has a specific interface /dev/console that is typically *not* interactive but just a sink for messages.)\r\n\r\nTo be honest, any of /x/tty, /x/console, /x/term, /x/termio[s] can work. I'm partial to /x/tty and /x/termio because I think those most accurately reflect the functionality we plan to put there, without suggesting that a lot of other quasi-related stuff (like ANSI escape sequences) wind up there.",
