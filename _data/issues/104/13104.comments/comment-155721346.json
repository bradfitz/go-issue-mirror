[Quote from golang-codereviews](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-codereviews/hq63SCACMJo/KL97UzWeEQAJ)\r\n\r\n\u003e This adds at one new syscall for every print to without a \r\nconsole and four new syscalls for every print to with an \r\nattached console. The Windows console is extreemly slow so \r\nthe extra syscalls won't be noticable.\r\n\r\nAlso, googling for \"windows console slow\" shows a different story wrt what @techtonik is telling us.",
