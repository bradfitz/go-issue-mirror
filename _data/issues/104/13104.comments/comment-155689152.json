The idea of setting raw mode, disabling or enabling buffering and echo are pretty universal.  Windows consoles can offer some enhanced functionality as well but for something like the needs of ssh that is entirely unnecessary. (Extras like double buffering and mouse reporting.)\r\n\r\nPlease don't use TTY for cross-platform stuff. It is overly complicated concept that may take up to 3 days to understand what is it about. The idea of setting raw mode, buffering and echo doesn't belong to the world of text mode user interfaces at all - all these hacks are made to make limited one-input-channel serial interface work for users, so maybe `x/serial` is what you need? My perception is that Linux terminal is slow and error-prone state machine - it is not nearly as fast as Windows console, and all this multiplexing/demultiplexing is the reason. Also think that clipboard copy/paste functions are also the things that are expected from the console, as well as multiple buffers that help to work with multiple outputs in parallel.",
