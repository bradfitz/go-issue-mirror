It could even be possible to express Windows console APIs in such terms.\r\n\r\nIn addition to just enabling / disabling raw \u0026 cooked mode (and echo/noecho), I see specific needs around:\r\n\r\n- baud rate determination (used for real serial lines, but even console programs need it -- for example curses type apps need to know \"baud\" rate when calculating padding character delays required in terminfo strings\r\n- tcflush \u0026 tcdrain\r\n- serial port manipulation (stop bits, parity, etc.)\r\n\r\nI'd far rather this all be expressed in terms of POSIX termios than some other way, at least to applications.  (Using ioctls or whatever under the hood is fine.)",
