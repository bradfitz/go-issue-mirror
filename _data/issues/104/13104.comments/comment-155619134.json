Despite feeling not feeling constructive there is value in it nonetheless.\r\n\r\nI feel that tui is misleading in that it invokes a higher level of abstraction than this package intends to offer. \"Term\" is common to Unix whereas \"console\" is common to Windows.\r\n\r\nI have to agree with Dave in that x/os makes the most sense but does feel like a dumping ground. Perhaps, like std/os, this is the right place for os specific terminal code and leave an os agnostic implementation for a separate, higher level tui package?",
