The termcap/terminfo parser alone would probably be a decent size, in addition to all the other things already mentioned. Plus all the os-specific versions of the interfaces for output (colours/styles/cursor positioning) and input (Ctrl-, Alt-, Fn-, Arrow-, etc keys) on non-Unix-like OSes.\r\n\r\nI looked at the links in the proposal, and (like my own [liner](https://github.com/peterh/liner)) none appear to support terminfo (or... is there a Plan 9 equivalent?). That's probably because everybody independently figured it wasn't worth the effort to write a terminfo parser for a single project. If the library and the effort are going to be shared, I'd be more likely to help.",
