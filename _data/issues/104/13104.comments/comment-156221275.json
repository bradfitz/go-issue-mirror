	"body": "I am not exactly sure what we have consensus on other than the repo name.  I do think we should factor out things like the Posix tc* routines into their own subdirectory/package. I agree that something like a full curses replacement is outside the scope of this repository.  I am not exactly sure where we should draw the line between these two extremes.  What I am hoping to see is that whatever we put into the packages inside this repo isolates me from needing cgo or needing os specific code.",
