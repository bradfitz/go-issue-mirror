	"body": "\u003e It sounds like this repository will contain code for (1) dealing with consoles/ttys/ptys, (2) termcap-style escape sequence generation and parsing, and (3) code for configuring serial ports. It's a bit of an odd mix, but it's certainly a common grouping historically. Is that list correct, @davecheney?\r\n\r\nI'd say 2 and 3. Because I believe that dealing with windows console is impossible in the same way as ttys and ptys.",
