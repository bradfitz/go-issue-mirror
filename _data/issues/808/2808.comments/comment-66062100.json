You should\ntell 'go get' what you want to install, and it will install it.\nIt will not install extra commands.  For example, if I run\n\n    go get code.google.com/p/codesearch/cmd/{cindex,csearch}\n\nit does not also install codesearch/cmd/cgrep.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
