Perhaps we should\nallow some kind of conventions for people who don't want it, like some build tag, a\nspecific directory hierarchy, or something else in that regard but I feel the current\nbehavior can be useful to many people. Think about forks or compatible reimplementations\nof things.\u003c/pre\u003e",
