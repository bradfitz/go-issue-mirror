In Go 1.5 the -a option to go build does rebuild everything, including the standard library, whether you are running a release build or not.\r\n\r\nI just tried running\r\n\r\nCGO_ENABLED=0 bash make.bash\r\n\r\non a clean checkout of Go tip.  It built a statically linked program version of ../bin/go.\r\n\r\nBut, you are correct: when, using that version of go, I run go env CGO_ENABLED, it prints 1, and it will link packages like os/user dynamically.  I did not expect that.  I'm not sure whether it is a bug or not.",
