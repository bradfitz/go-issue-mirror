As you can see from the initial issue I referenced (and others I can point to) usage of CGO_ENABLED vs. other methods of ensuring that a built binary is static (when not cross-compiling) has been a point of confusion, and I think a lot of that has been due to the changes to e.g. `-a` in 1.4 and more changes in 1.5.\r\n\r\nFeel free to close this, unless you want to keep it open as a documentation enhancement request.",
