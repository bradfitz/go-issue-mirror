Please ask questions on the golang-nuts mailing list or on https://forum.golangbridge.org/.  Thanks.\r\n\r\nI can't see what you are referring to in #9344.  In any case, when you check out go1.5.1, you are getting a released version of Go.  To get a non-released version of Go, you need to check out something that is not a release.  But of course those are not supported.\r\n\r\nIf you build your own version of Go with CGO_ENABLED=0 set in the environment, you should get a version of Go that builds statically by default.",
