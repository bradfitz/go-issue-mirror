I reported this bug to rsc directly by mail, so I'm changing the\nowner.\n\nHe fixed the ARM build but the similarity is too suspicious.  I believe there are\nfurther bugs in the area.\n\nSelect is the simplest way to tickle channel bugs, but it wasn't strictly required. \nHere's a simple case that crashed on ARM before the fix:\n\n\npackage main\n\nfunc main() {\n\tc := make(chan int, 1)\n\tselect {\n\tcase c \u0026lt;- 1:\n\t\tprintln(\"send\")\n\tcase \u0026lt;-c:\n\t\tprintln(\"recv\")\n\t}\n}\n\nNot sure if any of this helps. My main point is simply that the bugs reported here were\ntracked down to recent changes in the run time on another architecture.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._",
