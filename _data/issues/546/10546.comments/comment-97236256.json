The signal handler runs on the same M as the user code, so the user code can't make any forward progress.\r\n\r\nA simple fix to this problem is to print the stack if the G's M is identical to the caller's M.  The G can't be running, and crucially modifying its stack, if that is the case. (Unless of course the two Gs are identical, but we already skip printing in that case.)",
