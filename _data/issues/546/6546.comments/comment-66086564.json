Compatibility\npromise is not about \"if you know about code it can break\". It's about not changing\nbehavior of existing things that are not bugs (not broken), as one can never know where\na code, that would get broken, can exists and if it exists at all. But this is _not_ a\nbug. Not in the compiler, not in package testing.\n\nExample of panic(nil) being used to error-lessly return from an outer function from\nwithin a local function:\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/cznic/tmp/blob/7cdc7c6d85664e1fa120dde4a2b6c008a73a56f0/q/tests.go#L1401\"\u003ehttps://github.com/cznic/tmp/blob/7cdc7c6d85664e1fa120dde4a2b6c008a73a56f0/q/tests.go#L1401\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
