It's a correct and valid\nstatement and it is actually used by at least one  person on this planet. (Note: the\nprevious example if mine predates this issue.) The behavior of it is well defined. If\nsomeone somewhere wrote a function which exits, for whatever reason, in the non-error\ncase by panic(nil) (hopefully it's a non exported function in that case), then your\npatch would break the tests of that person's tests of that function.\n\nThe current behavior is not a bug, ie. that would clearly mean a clear breach of the\ncompatibility promise.\n\nPlease feel free to comment further, but I think I've said everything worth of it\nalready.
