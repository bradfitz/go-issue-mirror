IOW, the discussed example doesn't/cannot run into the\nsame problem as Elazar's code is.\n\nThe panic(nil) in the example is used like a fast-return-path from a recursive descent\nparser sometimes is. It can be done w/o panic (or exceptions in some other language),\nbut \"bubbling\" the stop message through all the levels up is a PITA.\n\nI've checked all my code, I have no other panic(nil) in any tested directly by package\ntesting, function, so no, I'm fortunately not relying on panic(nil) to exit a test\nsuccessfully ;-)\u003c/pre\u003e",
