I meant someone\ndoing something \nlike:\n\n    e, err := foo()\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(e) //oops\n    }\n\nIn application code.\n\nThen his tests pass by mistake, and it's tricky to understand what have happened.\n\nOf course, go vet cannot really find that.\n\nI really see no reason not safeguarding against this behavior. panic'ing on the wrong\nvalue is definitely possible, and I see no reason to assume it's not common enough to\nguard against.\n\nNote that this is a high cost mistake, as tests would silently pass.\u003c/pre\u003e",
