When we give memory back to the OS, that just reduces the RSS, not the virtual memory use.\r\n\r\nThe runtime will need some sort of fix to reuse the virtual address space for the second allocation.\r\n\r\nVirtual address size limits are in any case probably not what you want.  Virtual address space is essentially free on a 64-bit system.\r\n\r\nAlso, you've allocated an 85MB chunk and then freed it again.  There's no guarantee that the runtime (during runtime.GC or time.Sleep) doesn't allocate something small just after that 85MB chunk.  In that case, there's no way to reuse the 85MB of virtual address space for the 150MB allocation.\r\n",
