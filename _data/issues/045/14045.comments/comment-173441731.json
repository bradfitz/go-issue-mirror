	"body": "This seems like a different bug to me.\r\n\r\nSay the heap ends in 10 free pages.  We try to allocate something 20 pages in size.  Currently the code allocates 20 pages from the system to satisfy this request, because the request won't fit in 10 pages.  We really only should ask for 10 pages, as they will (probably) be coalesced with the 10 free pages at the end of the heap, resulting in 20 contiguous free pages.\r\n\r\nThe \"probably\" in there depends on what the OS decides to give us.  If it isn't coalesceable, then asking for only 10 pages doesn't help.  In fact it hurts.\r\n\r\nMaybe only if we would otherwise throw an out-of-memory error should we try and do this.\r\n",
