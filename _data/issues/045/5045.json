They should be as\nweak as possible, of course, but right now they are non-existence, which is a little too\nweak.\n\nWe might say, for example, that an atomic.Store writing a value to a memory location\nhappens before an atomic.Load that reads that value from the memory location. Is that\nsomething we want to say? If not, what do we want to say?\n\nWhat about Add?\n\nWhat about CompareAndSwap?\u003c/pre\u003e",
