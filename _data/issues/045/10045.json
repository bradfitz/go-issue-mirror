	"body": "**What version of Go are you using (go version)?**\r\n1.4\r\n**What operating system and processor architecture are you using?**\r\nLinux x64-64\r\n**What did you do?**\r\nI came across a question in [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28792884/go-generate-stringer-invalid-operation-has-no-field-or-method-string/) which described how the user was trying to use stringer to implement `String` function which he/she was trying to use in the code. Here follows the question:\r\n\u003e I'm trying to use the stringer cmd so that I can generate String() methods for some int types. Here is how the code looks like\r\n\r\n```\r\n//go:generate stringer -type=MyIntType\r\ntype MyIntType int\r\n\r\nconst (\r\n    resource MyIntType = iota\r\n)\r\nfunc myfunc(){\r\nprint(resource.String())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003e The error I'm getting on go generate command is invalid operation: resource (constant 0 of type MyIntType) has no field or method String which makes sense because there is no String method yet. How am I supposed to fix this error if stringer cmd is supposed to actually generate the String method? Should I use fmt.Sprintf(\"%s\", resource) all over the code ? it looks a bit ugly to me. At least not as nice as resource.String().\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to see?**\r\ngo generate should have worked.\r\n\r\n**What did you see instead?**\r\n`invalid operation: resource (constant 0 of type MyIntType) has no field or method String`\r\n",
