I just mean \"let's not guarantee more\nthan we need to guarantee to make things useful for people.\" That's a\ngeneral goal, not a concrete proposal.\n\nDmitriy, if you have time, could you please make a proposal about what you\nthink the atomics should guarantee? A few sentences here in the issue is\nfine.\n\nThanks.\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
