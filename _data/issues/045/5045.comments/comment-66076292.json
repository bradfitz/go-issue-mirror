These atomic\noperations never happen simultaneously. That is, for any two atomic operations e1 and\ne2, either e1 happens before e2 or e2 happens before e1, even if e1 and e2 operate on\ndifferent memory locations.\"\n\nIs that a good idea? Is it too strong? Is it more than we need, less than we need? Is it\ngoing to be too hard to guarantee on systems like Alpha? I don't know. But at least it\nis simple and I understand what it is saying. That's different than understanding all\nthe implications.\u003c/pre\u003e",
