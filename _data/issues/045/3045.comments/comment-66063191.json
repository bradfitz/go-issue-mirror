It looks like yandex.ru is not advertising the fact that it\nsupports ESMTP, so the mail client does not use EHLO, so it does not learn about all the\nextensions that are available, including AUTH.  The server is supposed to say \"ESMTP\" in\nthe 220 banner that it opens the connection with, but mx.yandex.ru does not:\n\n$ dial 'tcp!smtp.yandex.com!25'\n220 smtp18.mail.yandex.net (Want to use Yandex.Mail for your domain? Visit\n\u003ca href=\"http://pdd.yandex.ru)\"\u003ehttp://pdd.yandex.ru)\u003c/a\u003e\n^D\n$\n\n$ dial 'tcp!smtp.gmail.com!25'\n220 mx.google.com ESMTP o8sm58736941qan.11\n^D\n$ \n\nNotice the \"ESMTP\" in gmail.com's banner, as compared to yandex.com's.\n\nESMTP was introduced in 1995, and perhaps there are no servers left that don't support\nit.  Maybe we should change the net/smtp package to always say EHLO.  If you say EHLO to\nyandex, it does work and list AUTH as one of the supported extensions:\n\n$ dial 'tcp!smtp.yandex.com!25'\n220 smtp18.mail.yandex.net (Want to use Yandex.Mail for your domain? Visit\n\u003ca href=\"http://pdd.yandex.ru)\"\u003ehttp://pdd.yandex.ru)\u003c/a\u003e\nEHLO mit.edu\n250-smtp18.mail.yandex.net\n250-8BITMIME\n250-PIPELINING\n250-SIZE 42991616\n250-STARTTLS\n250-AUTH LOGIN PLAIN\n250 ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES\n^D\n$ \n\nI will try to find out whether it is a bad idea to say EHLO always.  Or maybe if auth !=\nnil SendMail should say EHLO always.  You might want to try to contact yandex's\ntechnical support and try to get them to fix their SMTP server greeting.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
