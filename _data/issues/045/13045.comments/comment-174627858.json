We haven't talked about variables or constants or functions yet, so I don't see where it would make sense to add any foos as constants or variables.\r\n\r\nI thought about using other constants in the math package to supplement the `math.pi` -\u003e `math.Pi` thing, but there are no useful acronyms that would give us an all caps one (`math.E` almost qualifies, but the lack of subsequent letters is ambiguous).\r\n\r\nThe time package has some, but they're a bit cryptic if you're not familiar with the whole standards thing (e.g. `time.RFC822`).\r\n\r\nThe only other acronym I can think of is `io.EOF`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think--abandon the foo, Foo, and FOO for some real constants, adding (somewhat spurious) lines to the code example and change the text to match?",
