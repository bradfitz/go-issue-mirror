	"body": "\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n`go version devel +fee02d2 Fri Jun 10 04:12:50 2016 +0000 linux/amd64`\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n`linux amd64`\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nRegister a CONNECT proxy handler to `http.ServeMux`:\r\n[https://play.golang.org/p/5rrDNhffaz](https://play.golang.org/p/5rrDNhffaz)\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nThe proxy handler was called for CONNECT requests.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n`http.ServeMux` can't find the registered handler. It uses `http.NotFoundHandler()` to handle the CONNECT request and `Client.Get` returns a `Not Found` error.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been reported in #9561 but it has been closed. I want to build a proxy using App Engine, but there is no way to register a proxy handler because only `http.Handle`(underly using `http.ServeMux.Handle`) is available for App Engine. Although it can be avoided by using `http.ListenAndServe` in a normal environment, I think small changes to `http.ServeMux.Handler` implementation can fix this problem.",
