Now I'm looking again and found this.\r\n\r\nDoes SSE work with http2? If not, why Firefox doesn't fall back to http1.1 for SSE too?\r\n\r\nAnyhow I think there is a problem with the documentation.\r\nI assumed a ResponseWriter always implements Hijacker unless otherwise noted but I was wrong, basically the documentation says: a ResponseWriter may or may not implement Hijacker, when and why we wont tell, you discover at runtime.\r\n\r\nYou say that it just works for every sensible use case so why bother, but you never know. It may save people time to document that http2responseWriter is not an Hijacker (and other possible cases?) so that if I need an Hijacker I can do everything in my power to have one.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events",
