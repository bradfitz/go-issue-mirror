	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?\r\n\r\n`go version go1.5beta2 darwin/amd64`\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?\r\n\r\n`OSX Yosemite 10.10.4`\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nThe problem can be reproduced by trying to cross compile the following code from darwin/amd64 to linux/amd64\r\n```\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n        \"fmt\"\r\n        \"os/user\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n        fmt.Println(user.Current())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn my OSX machine I ran:\r\n`env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build`\r\n\r\nThen I copied the binary to an Ubuntu machine and executed it:\r\n```\r\nubuntu@machine:~$ uname -a\r\nLinux machine 3.13.0-53-generic #89-Ubuntu SMP Wed May 20 10:34:39 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\nubuntu@machine:~$ ./golang_err\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n`\u0026{1000 1000 ubuntu Ubuntu /home/ubuntu} \u003cnil\u003e`\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n`\u003cnil\u003e user: Current not implemented on linux/amd64`\r\n\r\nIf I compile the code directly on the linux machine with the version `go version go1.5beta2 linux/amd64`, then it works correctly. This leads me to think that it is related to the cross compilation. \r\n\r\nIf the functionality is not to be implemented in 1.5 and it can be detected at compilation time, I would suggest that a warning/error is shown to the user in order to prevent deploying binaries that will break in production due to this issue.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that I may have missed any reference to it in the documentation, but if this is a know or \"works as designed\" behaviour, I'd recommend making it more visible.",
