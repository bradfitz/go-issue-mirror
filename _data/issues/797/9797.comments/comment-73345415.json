(We can always use 1.4.0, because we can't assume what\nversion the final user is using, so we should only the least version.)\n\nThe go15bootstrap document said we want to keep the compiler bootstrapable\nwith 1.4 for as long as possible, now this is one more reason to keep that\npromise.\n\nWhen building the base image we can use adg's gostrip tool to build a\nminimal Go 1.4 installation.\n",
