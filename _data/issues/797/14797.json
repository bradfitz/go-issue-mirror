	"body": "1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo version go1.6 freebsd/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\ngo version go1.6 freebsd/amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a bug report or a feature request, but the response writer used for HTTP2 doesn't support hijacking even though the HTTP/1.1 + TLS does.  \r\n\r\nExample code:\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/2o6LE5FHj3\r\n\r\nRun with:\r\n`$ GODEBUG=http2server=0 go run main.go`\r\n \r\nResponse says:\r\n```\r\n*http.response implements http.Hijack: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun with:\r\n`$ GODEBUG=http2server=1 go run main.go`\r\n\r\nResponse says:\r\n```\r\n*http.http2responseWriter implements http.Hijack: false\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI expected http.Handlers that Hijack connections with HTTP/1.x plaintext \u0026 TLS to work with HTTP/2 connections.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nCode failing because the response writer didn't support hijacking.\r\n\r\nCC @bradfitz ",
