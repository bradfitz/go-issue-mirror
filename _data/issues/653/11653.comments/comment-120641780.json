	"body": "It looks like this is happening really early in initialization.  I haven't looked at the test in particular, but the error message is informative.  It's trying to look up a PC at ...90d0 in StoreUintptr.  StoreUintptr starts at ...79e0, and StoreUintptr is only one instruction long.  So the mapping from pc to functions is broken somehow.  Given that StoreUintptr is the last function in its file (and its package?), we're probably not trying to look up that function at all, but some subsequent function that doesn't have a symtab entry.  Or we're getting the wrong module for it.\r\n",
