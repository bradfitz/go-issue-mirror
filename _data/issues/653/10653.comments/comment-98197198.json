	"body": "I admit the error message is poor but it is working as intended. You can't call something that doesn't have type func. If you look at case C, you'll see that it's missing one layer of \"func\" relative to cases A and B. Or, to put it another way, the evaluation of call's first argument must yield something of type 'func'. What it finds is a method, so it calls the method (without the tail of the action, which will become arguments to th function once it's evaluated). In cases A and B evaluating (calling) .Text yields _another_ function, which call will invoke. But in case C, evaluating .Test fails because it a method of type func(string)string and there is no argument available. (Compare to `{{call (.Test \"hi\") ''bye\"}}`.)\r\n\r\nI believe you are just misunderstanding the call operation. The template you want for case C is just \"{{.Test \\\"hi\\\"}}\". The template you have is correct for cases A and B because the first argument to call evaluates (in the sense of calling the corresponding method) to a function whose type is func(string)string.\r\n",
