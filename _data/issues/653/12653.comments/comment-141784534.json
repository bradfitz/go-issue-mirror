	"body": "goimports is automatically ran on every save of vim - a vim-go feature which has only this downside. \r\n\r\nThe problem mostly arises because I move a whole file (with not only one reference of the 'utils' package) and then I open it up in vim to change the package name - upon writing I would prefer if the current package is not imported - this will make all references to 'utils' inside the file be erroneous\r\n\r\nI think that is better, than the current situation where it will be imported and than vim will show the file to be fine, but there will be an import cycle.\r\n\r\nMy problem is mostly with vim-go and gorename(or another tool) not supporting moving between packages. \r\n\r\nBut I still think goimports  shouldn't import the current package. \r\n\r\nI also consider 'utils_test' to be different (and special) package altogether, I don't know how goimports handles that case though.",
