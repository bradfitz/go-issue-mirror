You want a warning because you don't want it disabled.\nBut when I cross-compile I am happy to have it disabled automatically,\nbecause otherwise my build would fail entirely. I don't want to see\na warning telling me about something that, if it weren't true, would cause\neven more problems.\n\nOne could imagine trying to second-guess a build failure and say well\nif cgo was implicitly disabled and there are cgo files then maybe we \ncould say (cgo is disabled) somewhere. But there's no guarantee that the\nproblem is cgo being disabled and not, say, a syntax error in the non-cgo\nversion of the code. It's very hard to be sure the added text is helping and\nnot confusing things more.\n\nI also don't see why cgo should be different from all the other possible build\nconstraints.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
