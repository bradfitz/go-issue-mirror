Otherwise you can't write your C code in a separate file.  And\nextending that to .s files is a very small step.\n\nSo I would say that you are after some mechanism that lets you control, in a package\nthat uses cgo, which compiler/assembler should be used to compile/assemble a specific\n.c/.s file.  We could abuse build tags to make this work, but otherwise I don't see how\nto get anything other than what you have.\u003c/pre\u003e",
