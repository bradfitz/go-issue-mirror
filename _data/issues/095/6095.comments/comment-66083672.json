There is no control over the\n    // order they appear (the order listed here) or the format they present (as\n    // described in the comments).  A colon appears after these items:\n    //\t2009/01/23 01:23:23.123123 /a/b/c/d.go:23: message\n\nConsidering that there aren't 23 months, it's obviously yyyy/mm/dd.  So it's ISO 8601,\nbut with slashes instead of hyphens.  Sorry, this is probably just \"Unfortunate\".  We\ncan't change it now.  But it's not a weird US or Europe time format with years at the\nend.  It sorts lexicographically.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
