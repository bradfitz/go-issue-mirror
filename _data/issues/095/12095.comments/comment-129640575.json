	"body": "@anlhord you are proposing a significant language change, yet this proposal is very light on detail, particularly in terms of motivation and rationale. \r\n\r\nThe Go project's development process is primarily design-driven. Right now, a lot of your proposal exists only inside your head. To have your proposal considered seriously, you must thoroughly explain its goals, rationale, spec, implementation plan, and tradeoffs. (Yes, this takes a lot of work. It's up to you whether you want to expend the effort.)\r\n\r\nHere are some resources that might help you better understand our development process:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/DesignDocuments\r\n- https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/TEMPLATE.md\r\n- http://talks.golang.org/2015/how-go-was-made.slide\r\n\r\nHowever,  I think it unlikely that this proposal would be accepted, as it seems (to me) at odds to Go's general design philosophy.",
