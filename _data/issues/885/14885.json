	"body": "There is no way to access the height and ascent metrics of a font with x/image/font. The per-glyph bounds are available, but the global height and ascent are needed to properly space lines.\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go version\r\ngo version go1.6 linux/amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go env\r\nGOARCH=\"amd64\"\r\nGOOS=\"linux\"\r\n[â€¦]\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nRead the godoc x/image/font.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nA way to access the font's height and ascent metrics.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nIt's possible to get the metrics for individual glyphs, but fonts typically have a global height and ascent that can be used for spacing lines. These aren't available.\r\n",
