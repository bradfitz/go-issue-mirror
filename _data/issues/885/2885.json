The metainformation contained\n   in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical\n   to the information sent in response to a GET request. This method can\n   be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied by the\n   request without transferring the entity-body itself. This method is\n   often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility,\n   and recent modification.\n\n14.17 Content-Type\n\n   The Content-Type entity-header field indicates the media type of the\n   entity-body sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method,\n   the media type that would have been sent had the request been a GET.\n\nSince it SHOULD be identical to the GET request, it is not mandatory--and it seems\nunnecessary to read the body to infer the content-type just for HEAD requests--but we\nshould not be returning an incorrect Content-Type (text/plain) for HEAD requests for\ne.g. mp3, html files.\u003c/pre\u003e",
