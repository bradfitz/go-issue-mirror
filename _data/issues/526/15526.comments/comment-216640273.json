If you try with tip, then your Extract could look a bit like:\r\n\r\n_ = slice[3]\r\na = slice[0]\r\nb = slice[1]\r\nc = slice[2]\r\nd = slice[3]\r\n\r\nI believe that should generate a single bounds check and indexed addressing. The cost is a single \"assertion\" at the top, but the savings are: no new intrinsics. :)\r\n",
