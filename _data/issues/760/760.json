	"title": "Go for windows - Incompatibility with Sophos: virus spyware message when executing the go .exe file",
	"body": "by **mehdi.khoury**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1.have sophos installed running on a windows XP computer\n2.8g HelloWorld.go\n3.8l -o HelloWorld.exe HelloWorld.8\n4.HelloWorld.exe \n5. gives output : access to file denied\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nit triggers an identification from sophos as the virus/spyware Mal/Krap-I \ntrying to execute a go .exe file (I tried with the HelloWorld.exe example)\nand sophos prevent the file from executing...\n\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\nGOOS is mingw\nGOARCH is 386\n\nWhich revision are you using?  (hg identify)\nMinGW-32 build of Go release 2010-04-27\t \nand\nMinGW-32 build of Go release 2010-04-13\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThe only way for me to execute the HelloWorld.exe is to desactivate Sophos \ncompletely ( unplug my internet cable and then Control+Alt+delete  and \ndesactivate any process that contains the name sav).\nProblem with that is it prevents any computer to run sophos and keep an \ninternet connection running while working on go programming at the same \ntime. Most of academic networks (in uk anyway) use sophos antivirus...\nIt would be nice to find a different trick that would allow to run go \nprograms while keeping sophos on.\n\nBest regards.\u003c/pre\u003e",
