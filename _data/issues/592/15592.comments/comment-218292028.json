I don't know the full design of the HTTP libraries, but the most straight-forward thing I can think of is `req.Header.AddWithOptions(\"apns-id\", \"abcdef123456\", http.HPACKIndexedFalse)`. (This would not have any effect on pre-HTTP/2 requests and may be incompatible with future HTTP versions.)\r\n\r\nOther than my above suggestion I'm unsure what the best plan would be to expose the indexing options, other than that it probably should not be a `bool` considering it's already a choice between three options, and more may be added in future versions of HTTP.",
