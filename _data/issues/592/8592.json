Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat does 'go version' print?\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\nIf possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/SQ2j7c2mpQ\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/SQ2j7c2mpQ\u003c/a\u003e\n2. There used to be a distinction between Marshal() and MarshalForHTML(), but that was\nremoved because it was deemed that HTMLEscaping \u0026lt; and \u0026gt; would always be better.\nFor my use-case, I want to keep those characters because:\n\na) It makes the resulting JSON file smaller\nb) It makes the raw JSON more readable\n\nWhat happened?\n\n\u0026quot;\\u003chtml\\u003e\u0026quot;\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\n\u0026quot;\u0026lt;html\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI know this issue has been discussed before\n(\u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/3127)\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/issue/3127)\u003c/a\u003e but I've been unable to find a way\nto disable the HTMLEscape() method. Is there any way to get around that? It makes\neverything much less readable and bigger (I transfer terabytes of JSON a month so these\nsmall changes add up). I think there would be value in offering a method for opting out\nof this automatic HTML escape feature.\u003c/pre\u003e",
