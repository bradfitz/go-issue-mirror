	"body": "As far as I know this doesn't affect cgo, unless GCC or LLVM start emitting vendor attributes with the debug flags cgo uses. It's a minor regression, but my concern is that a single attribute like this anywhere in an image prevents debug/dwarf from opening the entire image. I ran in to this when I tried to use my memory latency tool on a google3 binary. It doesn't care about any of these vendor attributes, but it couldn't open the image at all.",
