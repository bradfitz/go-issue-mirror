	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\n\r\ngo1.7beta1 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nUbuntu amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nWhile editing a (~larger) project using the LiteIDE editor, I noticed that the auto completion does not work anymore and \"jump to declaration\" and \"view expression information\" functionality is very slow (5-10 seconds delay) right after I updated from Go 1.6.2 to Go 1.7 beta 1 and the slowdown didn't go away after reboot.\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nAuto completion, \"jump to declaration\" and \"view expression information\" should be responsive (like when using Go 1.6.2)\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nAuto completion not working at all; \"jump to declaration\" and \"view expression information\" are very slow\r\n\r\n",
