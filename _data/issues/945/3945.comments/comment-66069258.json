Please tell us, how did you build the program, step by step? How do\nyou run it?\n\nAlso, when you see \"typical phone home for a solution\" dialogue, is there any useful for\nus information displayed? Just tell us everything you see there however insignificant.\nSometimes, Windows will create \"a crash error file\", if one is created, just open it\nwith your editor and send us the contents.\n\nAlso, there were some changes to cgo on windows that are not part of 1.0.2. Perhaps, you\ncan try latest version possible. Just follow \u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/install/source\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/install/source\u003c/a\u003e to get\nsource, but use \"tip\". Since you are building cgo program, I assume you already have gcc\ninstalled, so the rest should be easy enough.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
