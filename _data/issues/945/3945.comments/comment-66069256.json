After printing\nthe string to stdout, it \"stops responding\" (windows term). Windows then attempts its\ntypical phone home for a solution. Once that is finished or cancelled, the terminal\nprints a negative exit code. I don't recall if it is a different code each time or not.\nI'll comment when I can run it again.\u003c/pre\u003e",
