	"body": "I frequently have the need to add a custom CA cert to a go app (both my own apps, along with third party apps I run across). Currently you can create your own `*x509.CertPool` and add the CA cert to it, but now you can't verify using the system provided CAs.\r\nSince the code behind `systemRootsPool` has a lot of os/distro-specific logic, it would be good to use this logic instead of having to copy/implement it within the app.\r\n\r\nIf there is a concern about exposing this pool, and code being able to mutate it, then perhaps we could get something similar to `x509.initSystemRoots`, but which would return a new copy every time it's called.\r\n\r\nEdit: After some thought, returning a new CertPool is better. As there is no way to copy a CertPool, it would otherwise be impossible to add a CA cert to the pool without the cert shared everywhere.",
