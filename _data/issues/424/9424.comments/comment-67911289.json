Or to read the implementation of every package to figure out whether there are certain errors they should be on the lookout for?\r\n\r\nFor example: without knowing about url.Error, it's easy for one to see net.Error and try to use that for detecting temporary errors.  But _that doesn't work_ because url.Error doesn't implement net.Error.\r\n\r\nIn order to handle errors - and the existence of net.Error is a witness to the fact that there are useful properties of errors needed to handle them correctly! - the user must know that they exist in the first place.",
