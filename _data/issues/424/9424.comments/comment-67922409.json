Perhaps. Or maybe is useful. Or useful but not worth it. (putting all the various error logic into ShouldRetry, like `os.IsNotExist` etc, but with more logic)\r\n\r\nI don't have solid suggestions. If anything, I would file lots of separate concrete bugs and address them one at a time. Bugs like this risk getting depressing and non-actionable, which is further depressing in that I used \"actionable\".",
