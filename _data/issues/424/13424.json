	"body": "Within the `time` package, there are quite a few default time formats provided as constants. This includes an [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format string with and without nanosecond precision. There is also a \"handy\" timestamp format, which has a constant that includes millisecond precision.\r\n\r\nI can see there being value in the `RFC 3339` formatters also including one with millisecond precision. I personally have this format string copied amongst a few projects and would love to see it introduced in to the standard library.",
