Windows symlink support has changed significantly between 1.3 and 1.4. What does your \"go version\" command output?\r\n\r\n\u003e ... it seems to be some weird quirk on my machine and not reproducible.\r\n\r\nI don't believe in magic, there is always a reason. You should be able to work out what is going on. I would add new tmp test to path/filepath package that does something similar to your program above. Then add println or fmt.Printf statements in correspondent library code here and there (while running \"go test ...\" command) to see why your output is different from mine. You would obviously need Go source code for that.\r\n\r\nAlex",
