If I rebuild without rm-ing $GOPATH/pkg, I get the .a files from the previous\nbuild.\n\nI had hoped that I could use `go install -a` to recompile only those packages that that\nI depend on in my GOPATH, but my GOROOT is owned by root, not my current user, so I\ncan't rebuild standard library packages for each build (not that I'd want to).\n\nI can see how the current behavior could be desirable for someone working on the runtime\nand standard library, but I don't think it's generally useful, especially if go is\ninstalled via a package manager and owned by root.\u003c/pre\u003e",
