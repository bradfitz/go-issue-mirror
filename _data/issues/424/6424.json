	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the\nlatest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the\nlatest version of Go:\n\nRun \u0026quot;go version\u0026quot; and compare against\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html\u003c/a\u003e  If a newer version of Go exists,\ninstall it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\nI installed Go using the installer, which by default installs go to /usr/local/go . If I\ntry to use the -a build flag for go install, I get a permission denied error (because I\nas a user don't have permission to write to /usr/local). I'm not sure what the right\nsolution to this is, but it would be nice to have some kind of workaround where I can\nre-install all non std lib packages (or where I could re-install the standard library). \n\nWhat is the expected output?\nbrendan:~/Documents/mygo/bin$ go install -a github.com/gonum/floats\nshould work fine (or maybe with a different flag)\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nbrendan:~/Documents/mygo/bin$ go install -a github.com/gonum/floats\ngo install runtime: open /usr/local/go/pkg/darwin_amd64/runtime.a: permission denied\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\ngc\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\ndarwin\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.1.2 darwin/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#\"\u003ehttps://groups.google.com/forum/#\u003c/a\u003e!searchin/golang-nuts/runtime$20permission$20denied/golang-nuts/yniBC9gM9I0/6sqirDNIF08J\n\n\nAt the moment I can get around it by cleaning the contents of the package install\nfolder, but it would be nice to not have to do so.\u003c/pre\u003e",
