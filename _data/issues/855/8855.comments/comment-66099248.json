At that point it could be smart and re-parse a statement that started with\nsomething that might have been a keyword (by ignoring capitalization for a start, or by\nlooking at Hamming-distance, but where to stop?).\n\nOne could argue that in practice any identifier that is not a keyword, but that might be\na keyword if lower-cased is likely an error, but that's not true: For instance, Go code\nthat deals with Go code (such as the go/parser) is not unlikely to have identifiers such\nas Func, If, etc.\n\nBut even if one would go all the way and re-parse (or parse two separate paths), it\nwould require quite a bit of machinery to handle that special case reasonably well.\nDoesn't seem worth the effort.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @griesemer._\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
