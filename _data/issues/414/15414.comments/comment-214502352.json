I have been under the assumption that if I use ./all.bash when I build then it will build golang and run all the tests and that is the way I've been testing.  When I do that I see this in the list of packages:\r\n...\r\nok      net     1.365s     \r\n....\r\nALL TESTS PASSED\r\n\r\nBut then if I go back and build the test from the net directory after adding the latest go to my path this happens:\r\ngo test -c net\r\n./net.test\r\n--- FAIL: TestLookupGoogleSRV (0.00s)\r\n        lookup_test.go:73: lookup _xmpp-server._tcp.google.com on 9.8.234.129:53: no such host\r\n--- FAIL: TestLookupDotsWithRemoteSource (0.89s)\r\n        lookup_test.go:542: LookupSRV(xmpp-server, tcp, google.com): lookup _xmpp-server._tcp.google.com on 9.8.234.129:53: no such host (mode=go)\r\n        lookup_test.go:542: LookupSRV(xmpp-server, tcp, google.com): lookup _xmpp-server._tcp.google.com on 9.8.234.129:53: no such host (mode=cgo)\r\nFAIL\r\n\r\nShouldn't the same results occur no matter which way the net package test is run? \r\n\r\nThat was done on Ubuntu 16.04 ppc64le but I see the same thing on others.",
