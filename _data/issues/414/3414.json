	"body": "by **haavid@falch.net**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Create a new FileServer to serve from a directory containing an index.html file.\n2. Load the directory \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; or file \u0026quot;/index.html\u0026quot; in a browser.\n3. Make changes to index.html and reload it in the browser.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nThe new version of index.html.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nThe old version of index.html.\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nLinux x86_64\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\nweekly.2012-03-22\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nIf you also add or remove files in the same directory as index.html, or similar\noperations, the problem will not occur. The bug also depends on the browser having a\ncached version, and sending a \u0026quot;If-Modified-Since\u0026quot; header in the request.\nThis is happening because checkLastModified() is being called a few lines too early in\nserveFile(), causing it to check the modification time of the directory rather than the\nindex file.\nShort fix has been submitted for review, but will wait until after Go 1.\u003c/pre\u003e",
