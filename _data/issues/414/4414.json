	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. When moving code from file A to file B, I copy file A's imports as well.\n2. Run gofmt, which sorts the imports.\n3. Compile the code, which detects unused imports, which I can remove.\n4. I still need to remove duplicate unnamed imports manually.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\ngofmt could safely remove the duplicate unnamed imports.\n\nPlease use labels and text to provide additional information.\u003c/pre\u003e",
