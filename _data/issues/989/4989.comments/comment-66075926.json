It's ancient. If Go 1.0.3 is working for you, my suggestion\nis to keep using that.\n\nI believe that as of January 8, 2013, RHEL 5 has exited \"production 1\" and is now in\n\"production 2\" stage. That means that RedHat will stop releasing software updates for\nit. I hope that will cause many users to switch to a newer Linux distribution.\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/\"\u003ehttps://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
