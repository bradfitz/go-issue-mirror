The hard errors create different dialects of the language, and the ignorable warnings create noise.\r\n\r\nTwo simpler solutions:\r\n(1) don't make vet too clever.\r\n(2) if we really need dataflow analysis or SSA form, use the go.tools/x/go/ssa package, which is designed for source analysis tools that, like vet, want high fidelity to source and don't need to transform the IR.\r\n",
