What I imagine is that either go vet gains access to SSA-derived information, or else that we add a mode/flag to the compiler that would enable a bunch more warnings.\r\n\r\nI get the impression that we prefer doing this in vet.  How do we feel about the compiler gaining some flags putting it into \"vet-helper\" mode, if that turns out to save a lot on implementation effort or lets us add the analysis to vet a little earlier?\r\n\r\n",
