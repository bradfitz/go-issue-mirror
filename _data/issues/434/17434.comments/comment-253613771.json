It's not the *pauses* that are the problem, it's the CPU taken away from the compiler during the concurrent phase.\r\n\r\n\u003e Record allocation stats for each phase.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a good idea in general.\r\n\r\n\u003e Explicit GC cycle between FE and BE so we can measure how much live memory the FE has left for the BE to work with.\r\n\r\nAdding explicit GCs between phases seems necessary if you're going to isolate the performance of the different phases. I'm not sure what you mean by \"live memory the FE has left\" since live memory isn't something that's left, but I don't think this is about measurement anyway. Doing an explicit GC between phases resets the pacing so the scheduling of GCs during each phase is much closer to independent from the other phases (not exactly, since a change in the live memory remaining after an earlier phase can still affect the GC scheduling in a later phase, but you'll be much closer to independence).",
