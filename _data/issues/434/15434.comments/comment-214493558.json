	"body": "Thanks! Looking at the DNS response header from 10.155.248.190 in the cgo strace output, it's clear that the response *does* actually have `arcount==0`, which explains why libresolv proceeds to try the next name server.\r\n\r\nReplicating libresolv's behavior here seems easy, but feels kinda gross as it doesn't seem to be prescribed by the RFCs at all.\r\n\r\nFYI though, your netgo strace output looks incomplete though, like you're only tracing one of the OS threads.  In particular, it's missing the `write` call that actually produced the \"no such host\" output, and it's probably missing the `recvmsg` call that actually read the response DNS packet; the one in the output above failed with `EAGAIN`.\r\n\r\nI usually use `strace -f` to trace all children.",
