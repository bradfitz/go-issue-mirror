What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo 1.6.2\r\ngo version devel +093ac15 Mon Apr 25 06:00:15 2016 +0000 linux/amd64\r\n\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nlinux amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\n\r\nhttp://play.golang.org/p/O1SMk6JM1w\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nsuccess\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nGet http://registry-1.docker.io/v2: dial tcp: lookup registry-1.docker.io on 10.155.248.190:53: no such host\r\n\r\nWhen I set export GODEBUG=netdns=cgo+1, I do succeed but with the default or setting it to go, I always get the no such host.\r\nI have 3 DNS entries in my resolv.conf. The second and third entries can resolve the name.\r\nWith strace, I see that the cgo trace shows a request to each DNS resolver, however with Go, it only tries the first and fails.\r\n\r\n",
