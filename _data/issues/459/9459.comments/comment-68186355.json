Then it will work regardless of the line ending.\r\n\r\nFrom the fmt package documentation: *Scanf, Fscanf and Sscanf require newlines in the input to match newlines in the format*\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the documentation is misleading: *In all the scanning functions, a carriage return followed immediately by a newline is treated as a plain newline (\\r\\n means the same as \\n).*  \r\n\r\nAlways, and then there is a bug, or only when the formatting string has a \\n?
