I\ndon't think the compiler should handle this one case but not the others.\n\nHowever, handling the general problem is very hard because sometimes people\ndo write such tight loops to crunch data, for example, and the compiler\nshouldn't insert preemption points into such deliberate tight loops.\n\nI couldn't think of any valid use of for {} except toy examples, so I think\nthe status quo is fine.\n",
