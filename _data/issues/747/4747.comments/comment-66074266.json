The package\nis about turning data structures into JSON and back, and those two\noperations should be inverses of each other. I understand the situation\nyou've described, and I understand that it would be a little more\nconvenient to have encoding/json help a little. But there is more to\nvalidating user requests than omitting a field here or there. Next we will\nneed to add code to allow custom validator functions for specific fields.\nAnd so on. It seems better to me to let encoding/json be in charge of\nencoding/decoding, and do validation elsewhere. So decode into a separate\nHouse and copy just the fields you care about. Maybe even make a separate\ntype entirely so that user requests and actual data need not be so tightly\ncoupled.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WorkingAsIntended**._",
