	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eFrom an email:\n\n...\nruntime·notetsleepg in lock_sema.c calls\nruntime·semacreate in syscall context, so runtime·semacreate must\nnot split the stack. On Windows, runtime·semacreate is not marked as\nNOSPLIT. Perhaps it didn't have an issue because it was a trivial function\nand it got inlined? On Solaris, the function was also not inlined, but\nit was not trivial, it called another function that wasn't marked NOSPLIT.\n\nMaking runtime·semacreate and beneath NOSPLIT seems to have solved the\nissue on Solaris.\n...\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
