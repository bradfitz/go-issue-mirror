The problem is that there are conceptually two different scopes that users care about; call them the \"type checking scope\" and the \"pointer analysis scope\".\r\n\r\nMost users want the type checking scope, as used by \"referrers\" and \"implements\" queries, to be global, since it is relatively quick to find the set of packages that might need to be type checked, and both type checking and result reporting can occur in streaming fashion (although they don't yet).  But no user wants the pointer analysis scope to be global because it would make callers/callees/peers queries intolerably slow.  \r\n\r\nSome users, those with very large workspaces, might want the type checking scope to be less than global, perhaps the same as the pointer analysis scope, or perhaps some independent larger set of packages, but the idea of having not one but two scope parameters in the user interface seemed terribly confusing to me.  (One is already too many.)  I hope that we can make the referrers and implements queries both fast and streaming, so even users with large workspaces will find them acceptable---even if they sometimes interrupt the tool before it has finishing printing all references to, say, fmt.Println.",
