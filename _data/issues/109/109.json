	"body": "by **namegduf**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eBefore filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since\nthe latest release: run \u0026quot;hg pull -u\u0026quot; and retry what you did to\nreproduce the problem.  Thanks.\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Copy the original Hello World program, and add an infinite do-nothing \nloop at the end to keep it running.\n2. Compile and link to produce the output 6.out binary.\n3. Run the binary, and suspend it with Ctrl+Z quickly.\n4. Use ps aux/top/htop or similar to view its RSS.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\nI expect, according to Rob Pike on IRC, to see roughly ~1024KB RSS. Affected systems see\n~5600KB RSS.\n\nWhat is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?\n\nLinux/AMD64\n\nWhich revision are you sync'ed to?  (hg log -l 1)\n\n3975:b51fd2d6c16\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nNot all Linux/AMD64 systems trigger this, and I don't know what causes it. \nSystems observed to be affected are:\n\nDebian Squeeze, glibc 2.10.1-5, GCC 4.3.4\nUbuntu  9.04, glibc 2.9-4ubuntu6.1\n\nIf you want me to get any more information about the first system listed \n(the second was reported by someone else) I can do so.\n\nThe \u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot; program I used to reproduce this issue is:\n\npackage main\n\nimport \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\n\nfunc main() {\n  fmt.Printf(\u0026quot;Hello, \u0026amp;#19990;\u0026amp;#30028;\\n\u0026quot;);\n  for true {\n  }\n}\u003c/pre\u003e",
