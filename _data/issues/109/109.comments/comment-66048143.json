That's in the bss and mostly unreferenced.\nSimilarly there are two low-level allocators, and they each appear\nto have grabbed a 2MB chunk from the OS, but again hardly any\nhas been referenced.  The unreferenced parts should not be paged\nin and should not actually be using real memory, despite what \nprograms like top think.\n\nIt's possible that for some reason this intent is not happening,\nbut I think it's really a question of accounting more than anything else.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to **r...@golang.org**._\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
