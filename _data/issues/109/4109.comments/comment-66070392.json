In practice the only overlap then is \u0026lt;-\nand *. Cleaning up that bit in the spec should be easy.\n\nAs for func: yuck. Probably we should say all func conversion types\nmust be parenthesized, but gofmt should continue to accept the\nunparenthesized syntax where it does now and insert the parens.\n\nRuss\u003c/pre\u003e",
