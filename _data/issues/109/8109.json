Panicing in the calling goroutine / at defer\nstatement is failing early, might be useful for people.  Panicing late might be\nexpected, as the go/deferred routine doesn't actually use the nil value until then.\n\nPanicing late is what we do now.\n\nThe runtime meeting decided gri should figure this out, maybe update the spec.\n\nRelated to issues 8045 (go) and 8047 (defers).\u003c/pre\u003e",
