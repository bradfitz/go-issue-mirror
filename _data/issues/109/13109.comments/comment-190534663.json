	"body": "we could certainly do that. I took a naive approach of simply doing a `fmt.Sprintf(\"var arsc = %#v\", bin)` with a `go generate` cmd and produced a file 373KB in size which is what I mentioned above. This includes a bunch of extraneous `0x`s.\r\n\r\nI just simply don't know what is acceptable as @crawshaw initially expressed concern about the arsc file size of 5.6MB but didn't mention an ideal size. I stripped a bunch of unused portions from the table and gzip'd it bringing the size down to 63KB. I believe for the foreseeable future the parts stripped will not be required given the current goals.\r\n\r\nIf embedding the byte array in source is acceptable at that size (230KB with go-bindata) then I'd definitely prefer doing that.",
