	"body": "@dskinner what you're describing here sounds like reasonable improvements to the tool. Could you point me at some of your in-progress code so I could take a look?\r\n\r\nI would like, ideally for us to target just one version of the manifest. Maybe it should be a later version than the one we target now, so we can support some extra features? I believe our practical lower API bound is 15, not 9, already.\r\n\r\nIdeally users who want more sophisticated manifests can eventually do everything they need with ``gomobile bind```, and use the .aar files in Android Studio. That still needs some extra work: we haven't made x/mobile/app and x/mobile/gl work with the bind mode, but I believe it's much easier than trying to make gomobile build do all of the work of Android Studio.",
