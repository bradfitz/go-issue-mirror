(Perhaps other\nbenchmarks as well; I only happened to be looking for the regression in -test.bench=Map\nin runtime.)\n\n$ benchcmp e373697cd435.txt 884801fb67af.txt\nbenchmark                              old ns/op     new ns/op     delta\nBenchmarkSameLengthMap                 4.42          5.24          +18.55%\nBenchmarkMapStringKeysEight_1M         19.0          22.1          +16.32%\nBenchmarkMapStringKeysEight_64         19.0          22.1         +16.32%\nBenchmarkMapStringKeysEight_32         19.1          22.1      +15.71%\nBenchmarkMegMap                        20.3        18.2          -10.34%\nBenchmarkMapStringKeysEight_16         20.2          18.5          -8.42%\nBenchmarkMegEmptyMap                   3.58          3.30          -7.82%\nBenchmarkMapIter                       122           126           +3.28%\nBenchmarkMegOneMap                     12.7          13.1          +3.15%\n\n\nDave says:\n\n\u0026gt; Looks like code movement/alignment. The first has increased by .8 of ns, another\nbenchmark has decreased by 1.7ns. I think these numbers are low enough to be in the\nnoise, but it is concerning. Please consider raising an issue and cc'ing Dmitry to see\nif his performance dashboard can corroborate these numbers.\n\n\nThis (rough) delta is very consistent locally for me; I don't believe that it is noise.\nDmitry?\u003c/pre\u003e",
