That said, please consider whether doing a shallow clone fetches all the necessary tags for the go command to do its tag-based checkout selection. If a shallow clone does not fetch all the necessary tags, then a separate tag fetch would be needed, and if that's not possible then we can't do shallow clones at all.",
