As time goes on, a few little tweaks have been added to the clone model, and the result is more requests for more tweaks, more flags, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is natural and expected, go get is a simplified wrapper around a more complicated command so it is a logical conclusion that go get itself would have to become complex in turn.\r\n\r\nRather than this outcome, I suggest that we document the limitations of go get and recommend to people who need more that they simply skip go get, and use git clone; giving them the full power of the tool for their specific scenario without having to further complicate the simple model that go get provides.",
