	"body": "As mentioned in #15035,  Dialer.Cancel, which is introduced in Go 1.6,  can cancel any write operation on the established connection by closing the Dialer.Cancel channel. I don't believe that's intentional behavior. Dialer.Cancel must be applied to just the dial operation and must not carry any control knob to the following read/write operations.",
