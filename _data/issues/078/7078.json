	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eThe signature and docs are:\n\n// TryRecv attempts to receive a value from the channel v but will not block.\n// It panics if v's Kind is not Chan.\n// If the receive cannot finish without blocking, x is the zero Value.\n// The boolean ok is true if the value x corresponds to a send\n// on the channel, false if it is a zero value received because the channel is closed.\nfunc (v Value) TryRecv() (x Value, ok bool) {\n\nThe problem is that there are actually 3 possible outcomes:\n1. receive a sent value\n2. the chan is closed\n3. neither of above (nonblocking return)\n\nAt least we need to update docs to describe what is returned in case 3.\nA bigger issue is that the signature does not allow to distinguish between all 3 cases.\u003c/pre\u003e",
