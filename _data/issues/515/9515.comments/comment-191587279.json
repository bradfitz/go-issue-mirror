You can see it in the section:\r\n\r\n   Reverse pool summary:\r\n   ...\r\n   solaris-amd64-smartosbuildlet: 1/1 (1 + 0 other)\r\n\r\n(It also shows up at http://farmer.golang.org/builders)\r\n\r\nNow that I know one works, it'd be nice to have a dynamic number, so we can scale from 0 to dozens quickly, and have Solaris trybots and sharded tests.\r\n\r\nAnybody want to help make this better?\r\n\r\nI think it would involve making a custom image that runs the buildlet on boot as a service (SMF? some XML thing?), and then we'd need to do some Joyent API calls from farmer.golang.org to dynamically size the number of running images? I can do that part, if you write standalone Go code to resize the number of instances of an image. (or just stop/start them?)\r\n\r\n/cc @4ad @bsiegert ",
