I wrote a small program to read through the file (using Scanner) and the\nfile looks normal i.e., max line length is 1118 bytes (total lines = 3,834,974).\n\nIn any case, at the point it crashed, it has read approximately 1/7 of the file, i.e.,\nabout 370 MB. If the buffer is 272MB at that point, it very much looks like a problem in\nthe field buffer memory management.\n\nGiven the size of the file (it is a database export), I can't easily open it in an\neditor to take a look at it. Do you have any suggestions as to how I could check for\ndata corruption?\u003c/pre\u003e",
