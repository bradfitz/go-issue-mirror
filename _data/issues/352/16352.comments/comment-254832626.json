I'm not sure how you jumped to that conclusion from @quentinmit's reply.\r\n\r\nThere will be a Go 1.4.4 release to restore the ability to bootstrap on a Mac from C and Go source code only.\r\n\r\nBut nobody should be working that way day-to-day, so it's not super urgent priority. Even if you need to compile Go from source (which few people do), you can place the Go 1.7 binary download files at $HOME/go1.4 or to /any/path and set $GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP to /any/path and it'll work fine on Sierra.\r\n",
