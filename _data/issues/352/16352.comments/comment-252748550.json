I am trying to build fuchsia, specifically the mojom tool in fuchsia which is trying to generate bindings for a mojom file. This error occurs consistently and for different mojom files. The mojom binaries are built by Google and shipped along with the fuchsia source code.  Not sure what version of Go is being used to build it. I am on Go 1.7.1",
