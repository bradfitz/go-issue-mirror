And to follow up on the remainder of my comment, I didn't actually need to install from source, and had no reason to have to use brew, so I downloaded the pkg file for 1.7b5 from the main site.  \r\n\r\nIt seems to work fine, and based on the git history should contain the fixes for Sierra (for now at least üòÅ )\r\nNow to rebuild Hugo and hopefully stop the frequent, but intermittent, crashes.",
