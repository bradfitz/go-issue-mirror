The time system call interface is unchanged from Beta 4.\r\n\r\nI confirmed that `all.bash` passes on macOS 10.12 Sierra, using Go 1.7.1 as the GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP. It fails to bootstrap using Go 1.4.3.\r\n\r\nSo, should we cherry-pick the time fix back to Go 1.4.4 so there's a source-only way to bootstrap on macOS 10.12+?\r\n\r\nThe cherry picks would be:\r\n\r\nfad2bbdc6a686a20174d2e73cf78f1659722bb39 (the first change, for Sierra beta2)\r\n2da5633eb9091608047881953f75b489a3134cdc (the fix for Sierra beta4, and final)\r\nda070bed19fb23a8dd1b9f974c7fdf1f247fdba0 (the syscall package too)\r\n\r\n@ianlancetaylor, @rsc?\r\n\r\n",
