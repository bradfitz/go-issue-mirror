My company has a policy of using only fully repeatable builds of its entire dependency stack from source, including Go, and it also customizes some aspects like the default trusted SSL certificate authority search path. Mac OS X is not a core production platform for them, unlike Solaris, FreeBSD and Linux, but we use the same automated build process for our developers' Macs. For Go, the process builds 1.4.3 from source, then uses that to bootstrap 1.7.1. Things like OpenSSL security releases trigger full rebuilds of our /usr/local, a process that takes about 6.5 hours.",
