It is just a number. We try convert it into a string before we\nprint this error to the screen. Since we are asking specifically for English version of\nthat error message now, sometimes it does not work, because, it appears, not all\ncomputers have English error messages. We could use \"native\" error message in these\nsituations. Or we could just make error message ourselves, for example to be \"Windows\nretuned error #2\" or similar. Either is better the what is happening now: \"error 2\n(FormatMessage failed with err=15100)\".\n\nPlease, chose which one (\"native\" or \"made up English\") you want?\n\nAlex\u003c/pre\u003e",
