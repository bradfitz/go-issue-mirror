We are likely to discover several awkward corner cases as we implement this and use it across the tools, but the result will still be an improvement on the status quo.\r\n\r\nHaving ParseCgo as the default would be nice, but it's fiddly because you have to select the scanner disposition towards comments before you begin.  Two approaches to consider are:\r\n(i) restarting the scan from the beginning if you find an import \"C\".  This is possible because the input is a byte slice not an io.Reader, but it might be hard to avoid duplicate error reporting.\r\n(ii) using ad-hoc logic in the parser to find the comment preceding the import \"C\" when you encounter the import.  This is probably easier to implement.",
