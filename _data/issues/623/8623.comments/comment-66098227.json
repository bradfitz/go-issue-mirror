Are you saying that that callback does NOT exhibit\nthe problem?\nCan you print t, sin instead of just sin?\n\nI have no idea why being in the callback would matter. \nMaybe src/math/sincos_amd64.s uses uninitialized registers, but that seems unlikely.\nOr maybe PortAudio runs on a thread where an interrupt handler has been installed and an\ninterrupt arrives and smashes the floating point registers.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Accepted**._",
