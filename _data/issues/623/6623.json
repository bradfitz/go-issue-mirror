Please be aware that some people\nare not able to read comfortably it or read it at all for more than a brief time period\nwithout physical troubles. I suggest to never ever default to inverted colors anywhere\nwhatsoever.\n\n2. To make thing worse, the light gray text on black background has so low contrast that\nthe people having already trouble from the inversion scheme has now one more source of\npain. (Also a big sin of many Android UI screens.)\n\n3. People can select default fonts they're comfortable with in the browser. Please\nrespect that and do not force another font where it's completely unnecessary. It's a\ntooling report, not a design studio website front page or similar.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n- Select a font-family only, eg. 'monospace', not 'Menlo, monospace'.\n- Remove 'font-weight: bold;'\n- Support how many report styles you wish, but keep the default one which is plain black\ntext on white background by default (like this issues page.). The green/red emphasizes\non covered/not covered source lines is IMO ok.\n- If a B/W scheme is considered too \u0026quot;plain\u0026quot;, then I suggest to adopt the color\nscheme already used for source code by the the godoc tool. It has no accessibility\nproblems I'm aware of. The typographical consistency would be a nice bonus, I believe.\n\nMy apologies for I haven't followed the design of the cover tool before so I could\nprovide such feedback earlier.\u003c/pre\u003e",
