It's harder than you think.\"\n\nI was not aware you know what I think ;-) Anyway, in the OP above I've actually\nsuggested using two color schemes:\n\n1) Black text on white background without changing user-set or default monospace font.\n\n2) Adopt the style godoc uses when showing source code (after eg. clicking a function\nname).\n\nWrt 2, the approximative patch I use is at [0].\n\nI'm not pushing for a specific change, I'm happy with my patched version, it's an easy\nsolution for me.\n\nHowever, I believe that inverted color schema should never be used by default anywhere.\n\nGolang.org is not inverted. Godoc is not inverted. Go profiler tool SVG is not inverted.\nGo playground is not inverted. The Go project at code.google.com is not inverted. Go\nissues are not inverted. Go blog is not inverted. No Google search or other service I'm\naware of is inverted neither.\n\nBut suddenly, the Go cover tool is inverted colors. Surprising at minimum, isn't it? Is\nthere a good reason for it to be inverted? If so, why it seems to not apply to the\nexamples above?\n\n  [0]: \u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/cznic/7056369#file-gistfile1-diff\"\u003ehttps://gist.github.com/cznic/7056369#file-gistfile1-diff\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e",
