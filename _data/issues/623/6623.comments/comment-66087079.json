To print a book with white text on black background a white paper and black\n\"ink\" is used ;-)\n\nThere are magazines with light text on dark background. I think the point (nowadays) is\nthat books use to be read for much longer time spans than any graphically poor magazine\ncan ever hope for.\n\nCRTs: Well, one NOT or XOR gate is all what was needed. I seem to recall some trouble\nwith the early luminophores, aging proportionally to the current (lightened pixel ==\nmore current) integral dt.\u003c/pre\u003e",
