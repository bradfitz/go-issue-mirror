And for the -count cover mode, you need to see a distinction between\nthe various levels of coverage.\n\nWe found that colored text on a white background was very hard for people to read, while\na black background made it much more legible. We use very dark text to signify the code\nthat is not tracked by coverage, because that code is irrelevant in the context of the\ncoverage report.\n\nAgain, this scheme was the result of much experimentation with the input of many people\nwith various vision impairments. If someone wants to do the work to improve this (and do\nuser testing, like we did) then I'm happy to take a look at it, but I don't want to\nspend more time defending the current situation.\n\nI hope that clears up the reasons why we took this route.\u003c/pre\u003e",
