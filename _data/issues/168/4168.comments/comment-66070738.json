So it does omit individual empty strings from the slice:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/ZrcLRf86Vd\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/ZrcLRf86Vd\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nAt this point, I see this as something someone might have intended, and I'm reluctant to\nbreak their code to switch to this alternate meaning. So I think we have to live with\nthis for now. It is possible to work around by using an extra element in the data\nstructure (a pointer to a struct containing a []string, for example, or just a\n*[]string).\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **Unfortunate**._",
