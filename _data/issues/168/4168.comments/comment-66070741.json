I'm not sure why having an empty parent is useful at\nall. In my case it causes the API I'm working with to throw a fatal error. Doing the\nworkaround really defeats the purpose of \"omitempty\" + \"\u003e\".\n\nJust to make everyone happy, could we have tags like:\n\nomitempty\nomitempty-parent\nomitempty+parent\n\nWhere \"+parent\" would mean omit this AND the parents. \"-parent\" would mean don't omit\nthe parents. \"omitempty\" would use -parent by default, for now.\u003c/pre\u003e",
