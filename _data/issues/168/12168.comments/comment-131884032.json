	"body": "In contrast to some other (often dynamically typed) languages, Go explicitly distinguishes between functions returning a result and functions that are purely procedural. This is done by explicitly specifying a result (or results) and by requiring explicit returns.\r\n\r\nIt's tempting to not want the return, especially for smallish functions. But smallish functions are typically also the one returning only a single result and/or having unnamed results - so the benefit is not clear.\r\n\r\nFor larger functions, requiring the explicit return is a significant hint for readers and shouldn't be easily abandoned. Note that \"naked\" returns are a convenience that should be rarely used, not a major feature.\r\n\r\nIn short, I'm also strongly against this proposal.\r\n",
