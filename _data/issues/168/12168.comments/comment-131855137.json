	"body": "I agree with @davecheney. And three more reasons this is a bad idea:\r\n\r\n1) it would now be possible to start writing a function, get sidetracked, start working on another function, and accidentally produce code that compiles, forgetting to finish the function. The \"return\" is an explicit indication that the function should return. No magic.\r\n\r\n2) If this proposal were accepted, people would have style debates and vet/lint rules about whether or not to include the now-optional and redundant return statement. We don't want to see such style options and debates appear.\r\n\r\n3) You wrote:\r\n\r\n\u003e Go requires a return statement (with or without arguments) \r\n\r\nExactly. It's currently consistent. Your proposal would make it inconsistent: function would only sometimes require a return at the end.\r\n\r\nI propose declining this proposal for its benefits (less typing) not outweighing its disadvantages. But I leave that job to @adg.\r\n",
