	"body": "Quoting Alan's comment on the internal bug:\r\n\r\n\u003e We could \"fix\" this by changing the external tool, but that's unsatisfactory for two reasons. (1) External  users are very unlikely to encounter this problem because their GOROOT will be either unset or set to a valid directory.  Effectively we'd be adding a bizarre new invariant to the external code base, namely that the tool must work without access to the standard library.  (2) Even if we hand-code the Stringer type, the tool has dependencies on other standard types like fmt.Formatter that mention named types, and it may grow more in the future.  The same workaround won't work for them.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e So I think the right place for the fix is in [our internal tools, to set GOROOT correctly.]. \r\n\r\nClosing this.\r\n",
