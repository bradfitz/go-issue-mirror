(URLs use host names, for instance, but not all\nprotocols do. See RFC 2181, section 11, for a discussion of the difference) Legitimate\ndomain names like _jabber._tcp.gmail.com yield false.\n\nThis is related to bug #1167 but it seems there is no way in the bug tracker to reopen a\nclosed bug.\u003c/pre\u003e",
