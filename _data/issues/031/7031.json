Put: \n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/CIWWSEt6Gh\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/CIWWSEt6Gh\u003c/a\u003e as jira.go\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/7E4f8BBwUq\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/7E4f8BBwUq\u003c/a\u003e as jira_test.go\nin $GOPATH/github.com/grovespaz/gojira (Actually\n\u0026quot;D:\\go\\src\\github.com\\grovespaz\\gojira\\\u0026quot; in my case)\n2. Run 'go build'\n3. Run 'go test' \nNOTE: Running go build and go test seems to trigger the error more often than running go\ntest straight away.\nIf the error doesn't appear, running 'go build' and 'go test' a few more times\nafterwards makes it appear here.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nI expect the test to pass.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\n# github.com/grovespaz/gojira\npack: non-object file $WORK\\github.com\\grovespaz\\gojira\\_obj\\_go_.6\nFAIL    github.com/grovespaz/gojira [build failed]\n\n(go test -x output at \u003ca href=\"http://hastebin.com/kurevuxifi.md)\"\u003ehttp://hastebin.com/kurevuxifi.md)\u003c/a\u003e\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nWindows 7\n\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.2 windows/amd64\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nIf I remove the lines that reference http, the error doesn't seem to appear. (Like so:\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/OzbwLv2e7Z)\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/OzbwLv2e7Z)\u003c/a\u003e\nThe error appears intermittently, about half the time I run 'go build' and 'go test'.\nIf I have run go build and go test and no error occurs, I seem to be able to run go test\nas much as I want without errors, but this is not always the case.\nRunning go build and then go test nearly always gives me the error.\n\nI have randomly tried stripping as much as possible from the files while still making\nthe file build. While doing that, the following messages have appeared as well:\n'pack: bad package import section in $WORK\\github.com\\grovespaz\\gojira\\_obj\\_go_.6'\n\n'pack: non-object file $WORK\\github.com\\grovespaz\\gojira\\_obj\\_go_.6\npack: zero length file $WORK\\github.com\\grovespaz\\gojira\\_obj\\_go_.6\nFAIL    github.com/grovespaz/gojira [build failed]'\n\nRunning 'go test' again after receiving this different error message results in either\nthe 'regular' error message or the test succeeding.\n\nWhen stripping as much stuff as possible I noticed that even if the jira_test.go package\nshouldn't compile (because it's referencing a function or field that has been removed in\njira.go) it will still give the pack error most of the time. When it doesn't, it gives\nme the compiler error I'd expect.\n\nCopying the package to $GOPATH/github.com/grovespaz/bug doesn't stop the bug from\nappearing.\n\nI can try almost anything you want on my machine to further help you diagnose this issue.\u003c/pre\u003e",
