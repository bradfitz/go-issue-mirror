I have never seen occasional segmentation faults w/ gofmt, which\nmakes me think perhaps there is something else going on here.\n\n- Can you reproduce this sporadic behavior on any other machine?\n- What else are you running on your machine?\n- Is there enough memory?\n\nPlease provide as much detail as you can since I cannot reproduce this behavior at tip\nat the moment. Thanks.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n_Owner changed to @griesemer._\n\n_Status changed to **WaitingForReply**._",
