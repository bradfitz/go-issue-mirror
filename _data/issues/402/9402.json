	"body": "(I realize syscall has moved to its own repo as of 1.4, but that repo doesn't have a bug tracker so I assume this is still the right place to file such things, please correct me if I'm wrong.)\r\n\r\nThe unix `Sendmsg` and `SendmsgN` system calls permit passing in multiple buffers through the use of an io-vector structure, however the Go wrappers for these functions take only a single `[]byte` and hard-code the length of the io-vector to 1. It would be very useful for performance in some cases (such as https://github.com/Shopify/sarama/issues/238) if `Sendmsg` could be made to take a `[][]byte` and construct the equivalent io-vector.",
