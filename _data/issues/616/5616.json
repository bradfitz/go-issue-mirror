	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eSo far syscall package holds tons of constants, a bit abstracted and raw functions that\nwrap syscalls especially for networking stuff.\n\nE.g.,\nConstants assigned by IANA (IPPROTO, IFType,), other standard bodies (could be moved\ninto each specific package)\nSet/Getsockopt for Windows\nSet/GetsockoptInt,Facilites for Unix variants\nRouting sockets, constants for BSD variants\nNetlink sockets, constants for Linux\n\nWe can reconsider the package shape even under the Go 1 contract.\n(and make things easy for bridging btw Go1 and Go2.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
