	"body": "I originally wanted to use git config for the config files. There were two issues. (1) Russ wanted key: value instead. (2) There was no obvious way to check in repo-level git config in a way that git config would automatically respect, and there were objections to the filename I chose. Rather than squabble/bikeshed, I acceded, and I'm not sure that reopening that particular discussion has much value.\r\n\r\nAs for having hooks accept an argument to install just a subset of hooks that seems ok. What happens if hook A is installed and hook B is requested for installation? Does A stay or go?\r\n\r\nI'm not really the maintainer here, though, so this is just me kibitzing. ",
