	"body": "The idea of -trimpath is that you are building in /tmp/iant-12345/ and you want to strip that prefix because it's not useful.  The result is intended to be a relative path--it's relative to GOROOT or GOPATH, depending.\r\n\r\n\u003e I want to pre-build the supplementary packages provided with Go in a proto area, but later, install them from a package into the system root. So the recorded paths should be an absolute path referring to the system root, not relative to some other area if I understand correctly.\r\n\r\nThat sounds more like GOROOT_FINAL than -trimpath.  But GOROOT_FINAL is specific to GOROOT.  I don't think we have a feature like that in the toolchain.",
