Even though 'nil' is\nassignment compatible with []T, the '[]T(nil)' \"cast\" (actually a conversion) is not a\n\"type hint\". It's an expression of type '[]T' and only as such it can be passed legally\nto append().\n\nThe specs could be in theory changed so that 'append(nil, 3)' would infer type '[]int',\nbut Go designers prefer explicitness and I think they're pretty right in this.\u003c/pre\u003e",
