	"body": "by **john.berthels**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/hLyBQYF_W5\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/hLyBQYF_W5\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nerr1 \u0026lt;nil\u0026gt;\nerr2 \u0026lt;nil\u0026gt;\nCases handled the same\n\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nerr1 mime: no media type\nerr2 \u0026lt;nil\u0026gt;\nCases handled differently\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nubuntu linux 13.04\n\nWhich version are you using?  (run 'go version')\ngo version go1.1.2 linux/amd64\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nWe're in the process of replacing a production service with a re-implementation in\ngolang. This throws an error \u0026quot;mime: no media type\u0026quot; with POST requests from an\nexisting application. Investigation shows the POST lacks a content-type header, which\ncauses ParseForm to error.\n\nMy reading of RFC2616 section 7.2.1 suggests that a server should treat an absent\n'Content-type' as 'application/octet-stream'.\n\nParseForm is being called, even though the input content-type is not\nx-www-form-urlencoded, in wrapper code which wants to extract url parameters and/or form\nparameters.\n\nLooking at the code in net/http/request.go, I would think that parsePostForm should\nreturn err=nil in the case of an absent content type. i.e. change:\n\n   663\t\tct := r.Header.Get(\u0026quot;Content-Type\u0026quot;)\n   664\t\tct, _, err = mime.ParseMediaType(ct)\n\nto\n\n   663\t\tct := r.Header.Get(\u0026quot;Content-Type\u0026quot;)\n+               if ct == \u0026quot;\u0026quot; {\n+                       return\n+               }\n   664\t\tct, _, err = mime.ParseMediaType(ct)\n\n\nWe're working around the problem, but I thought I'd report the issue for your\nconsideration.\n\nregards,\n\njb\u003c/pre\u003e",
