The big button on the main page is fine, but it links to\n\u003ca href=\"http://golang.org/doc/install\"\u003ehttp://golang.org/doc/install\u003c/a\u003e .... which is a huge wall of text. \n\nI see a few problems with that page:\n1.) The download link is halfway down the page, so it's hard to find if you don't know\nwhere on the page it might be\n2.) It says download the \"Go tools\"... which to me is not obviously the same as\n\"download Go\".... so some might think there's something else they should be downloading\nfirst.\n3.) There's very little difference between H3 and H4 styling, so it's hard to tell\nwhat's a subcategory of what.\n\nPersonally, I'd put the download link right at the tippity top of the install page,\ndefaulting to the OS/arch of the user, with a \"other OS\" link to the download binaries\npage like mentioned above.\n\nI didn't have a problem identifying links, but it is good manners to underline links.\u003c/pre\u003e",
