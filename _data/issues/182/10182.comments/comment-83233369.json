	"body": "Since the addition of text has been rejected, an alternative would be to remove the regardless clause to become, \"The next Read should return 0, EOF.\"\r\n\r\nI take @robpike's point that the final paragraph allows returning 0, nil when len(p) == 0. However, given that the regardless is unnecessary and so easily read as an emphatic (I actually still find it hard to read otherwise even with the external commentaries), its presence muddies the clarity of the documentation by making the reading \"The next Read should return 0, EOF regardless [of all other conditions].\"",
