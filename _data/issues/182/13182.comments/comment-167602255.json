	"body": "Like @adg, I don't believe this proposal has enough benefit to warrant the complexity suggested for the API. The log package already has a way to divert output, namely `SetOutput`. Instead of adding a second, why not use the first?\r\n\r\nNote that the log package guarantees to deliver each message in a different Write call. So if you really need to tweak the format, it's possible to do today with no changes to the standard library: tweak the log message itself. Quoting the docs:\r\n\r\n    A Logger represents an active logging object that generates lines of output\r\n    to an io.Writer. Each logging operation makes a single call to the Writer's\r\n    Write method. A Logger can be used simultaneously from multiple goroutines;\r\n    it guarantees to serialize access to the Writer.\r\n\r\nThe only possible benefit I can see is that the current output writer doesn't know the call depth on each Write, so it can't reconstruct the file and line number for itself. But if that's really important, it's easy to pull them from the written data.",
