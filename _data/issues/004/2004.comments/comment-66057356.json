I don't have an alternative that would have made your life easier, but here are\nsome weak ideas that come to mind:\n  - a method on http.Request that tells you whether it's valid\n  - a method on http.Request that fills in its default values (but that's what http.NewRequest already does)\n  - log a message in ProtoAtLeast if it's 0,0\n\nI tend to look at the type definition if I'm writing out a composite literal, and make\nsure to fill in relevant fields in that order. Maybe this is one of those cases where\nprogrammer habit is better than programmatic enforcement.\u003c/pre\u003e",
