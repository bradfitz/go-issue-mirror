That handles the variant of this case called test2 in CL\n100470045's test program.\n\nThe handling of interfaces did not have the same conservative behavior; in CL 100470045\nit will match what we already did for concrete pointers.\n\nTo be clear, the 'conservative' here is not interpreting integers as pointers. It is\nmerely saying to the garbage collector 'I don't trust my static type information, look\nin your allocation records please'.\n\nI'm happy to explore what happens if we use the static type information for pointer\ntraversal in 1.4. Of course, if we move to pointer bitmaps for the whole heap as the\nprimary metadata used during collection, there would be no static type information to\nworry about and this would all be moot.\u003c/pre\u003e",
