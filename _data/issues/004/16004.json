	"body": "Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ngo1.7beta1\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nppc64 multiple OSes with instruction sets earlier than power8\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nIf possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.\r\nA complete runnable program is good.\r\nA link on play.golang.org is best.\r\nTry to build golang on ppc64 with an instruction set earlier than power8\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nSuccessful build.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nSIGILL during the build on a power7 ppc64 system.\r\n\r\nSome performance changes were added to go1.7 to improve performance for ppc64x, in some cases using instructions from power7 or power8 instruction sets.  For ppc64le we want to use the newest instructions and get the best performance, but for ppc64 BE there are legacy systems with earlier instruction sets that want to be able to continue to build golang.  \r\n\r\nThe two CLs that introduced newer instructions are 22772 and 22549.  Those changes will be modified to generate legacy instructions for ppc64 BE and keep the newer instructions on ppc64le.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
