The trick is that this value may be different on different\nmachines.  How old a linux do we claim to support?\n\n/proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr is the minimum the kernel will ever give you, even if you ask\nforcefully with MAP_FIXED.  I don't know if there is a separate minimum for\nnon-MAP_FIXED requests (if there was, we could possibly use that value).\u003c/pre\u003e",
