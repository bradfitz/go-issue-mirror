	"body": "It occurs to me that a feasible solution is to run the cover analysis on two files, the original and the cgo output. Rewrite the cgo output file as usual, but append the position data from the scan of the original. To work without bringing the diff algorithm in, which I would like to avoid, it would require that all cgo rewriting is within a line, that is, that it does not add or delete any lines. It does this today (otherwise coverage wouldn't work at all), but I am a little nervous to add this requirement.",
