This mattered in more before Go 1.2 when it would always try\nto advance to the next request if your handler didn't reach EOF on its own.  Nowadays\nMaxBytesReader is convenient but not really required for anything.  I don't think it's\nworth exporting more things in net/http or expanding any documentation for this case.\nNothing in the current code precludes people with special needs from doing what they\nneed.\n\nIf there are other unexported errors, please file separate bugs for them.\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n_Status changed to **WontFix**._",
