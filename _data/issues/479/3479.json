	"body": "\u003cpre\u003eAs a test I start 'cat \u0026gt; somefile' on the remote machine, then write 0's to its\nstdin, then Wait(). I've found that the writing succeeds and cat exits, but Wait() never\nreturns.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1.) Create a new directory to use as GOPATH:\n$ mkdir -p ~/ssh_test_issue/src/ssh\n2.) save the attached test file:\n~/ssh_test_issue/src/ssh/ssh_test.go\n3.) $ export GOPATH=$HOME/ssh_test_issue\n4.) $ cd $GOPATH\n5.) $ go test -v ssh\n6.) Repeat a couple of times and you'll notice that sometimes it succeeds, and on\noccasion it hangs inside session.Wait() when the number of bytes written was \u0026gt;655360.\n\n$ go version\ngo version weekly.2012-03-27 +95e67cc5fa08\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments:\n\n1. \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/go-attachment/3479/0/ssh_test.go\"\u003essh_test.go\u003c/a\u003e (2113 bytes)",
