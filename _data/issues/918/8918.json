	"body": "by **fuzxxl**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eRight now, the log package provides two ways to log:\n\nFirst, you can create a log.Logger and call various logging functions on it.\nSecond, you can directly call functions from the log package with the same API as in the\nfirst case.\n\nIt would be great if there was a way to retrieve and substitute the global default\nlogger, just like it is possible with os.Stdin, os.Stdout, and os.Stderr. This would\nmake it possible to have functions that operate on a Logger object log to the default\nlogger and to substitute something else for the default logger, such as a Logger\ngenerated by log.syslog.New().\n\nImplementing this might be as easy as making the already existing log.std variable\nvisible to the outside.\u003c/pre\u003e",
