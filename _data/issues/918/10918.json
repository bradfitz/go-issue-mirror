I tried asking several times on the gonuts forum as well as stackoverflow as to its intention, and how it should be used. With this change however, it now breaks some functionality I had in a previous version of Go.\r\n\r\nI unfortunately have to deal with SOAP APIs quite frequently. So I use a custom RoundTripper that parses the response body for the fault and returns a new error type specific to a soap fault. While I know this goes against what was then slightly documented (http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#RoundTripper), I'm note sure I'm sold that this restriction of resp == nil when error != should be enforced, as it was not before.",
