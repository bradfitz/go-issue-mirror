On screen will be displayed what is expected to appear in the\nresultant hello.go file made by bug.go.\n4. hello.go is uncompilable due to a comment having been placed\nin the middle of a Printf call by either go's parser or printer library.\n\nWhat is the expected output?\nhello.go (that is produced by bug.go) should be nearly the same\nas the screen output of bug.go. At the very least hello.go should\nbe compilable.\n\nWhat do you see instead?\nhello.go can not be compiled\n\nWhich compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?\n6g version release.2011-02-01.1 7434\n\nWhich operating system are you using?\nUbuntu 10.10 64 bit (linux kernel: 2.6.35-25-generic)\n\nWhich revision are you using?
