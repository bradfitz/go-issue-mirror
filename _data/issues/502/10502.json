	"body": "This is a follow-up for issue #2445.\r\n\r\nIf there ever was a note in the `elliptic` library warning programmers to check if adversarially-chosen points are on the right curve or in the right subgroup, it's no longer there.  Implementers often forget or assume that `Unmarshal` or `ScalarMult` does the checks for them, so stating that they don't somewhere conspicuous should help avoid lots of stupid vulnerabilities in production code.",
