	"title": "proposal: A security response policy for Go",
	"body": "As the use of Go in security-sensitive applications grows, I believe it is time that Go had a more formal policy on how security problems are handled.\r\n\r\nWe could start with the creation of a 'security@golang.org' email address that would be used to report suspected security issues. Those messages would be reviewed by a small group (\"Go security review team\") with a commitment to a 24-hour initial triage and review.\r\n\r\nBased on the assessed severity of the report, the security review team would assign it to one of these categories:\r\n\r\n* Not a security problem, and the reporter will be asked to submit a regular bug report instead.\r\n* A security problem that should be fixed, but is not being actively exploited.\r\n* A security problem that is being actively exploited and must be addressed immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe standard Google policy, which Go would be minimally obligated to adhere to is:\r\n\r\n* 90-days to fix regular security issues before the details can be made public\r\n* 7-days to fix actively exploits before details can be made public\r\n\r\n",
