This, together with mocking regLoadMUIString for testing e.g. error values, panics and the buffer growing would allow for better testing of this function.\r\n\r\nHowever, all of the above could still be way to much effort for testing something that seems relatively stable and does not involve much code and is also somewhat tested indirectly through TestToEnglishName...",
