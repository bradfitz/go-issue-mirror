The WebKit policy  - https://www.webkit.org/security/ - includes a process for becoming a member of the security review team, which is interesting, but probably too much for our needs (IMO).\r\n\r\nThe Xen Project - http://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html - also contains an official embargo process, which I would prefer to avoid.\r\n\r\nAre there others that we should be evaluating? I'm inclined to start with the Rust policy as a template, and customize slightly for Go.",
