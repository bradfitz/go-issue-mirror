Short embargoes are generally unproblematic. Notifying the private `distros` list on the same day as the commit does not make sense, you can just wait for the commit and notify the public `oss-security` list.\r\n\r\nYou really should add security-related regression tests to the public test suite, which means you have to reveal details about exploitation.  This also helps those (like Debian) who have to keep alive older branches much longer than you do.\r\n\r\nThe bigger challenge is to consistently identify fixes as security-relevant if they stem from a non-security bug report. (This is what large projects like Linux, LibreOffice, and smaller ones such as GNU libc are struggling with.) Maybe the policy could say something about that.",
