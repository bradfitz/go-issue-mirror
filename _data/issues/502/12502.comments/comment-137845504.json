Given those reasons, how about this change: Only allow relative imports of internal packages.\r\n\r\nIn other words, this would be allowed:\r\n\r\n    $GOROOT/src/example/example.go (Imports \"./internal/other\")\r\n    $GOROOT/src/example/internal/other/other.go\r\n\r\nSince internal packages only make sense in the context of packages that import them, I don't think this change would be a problem.",
