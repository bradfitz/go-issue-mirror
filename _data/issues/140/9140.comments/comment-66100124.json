Sharing the same name doesn’t\nintrinsically mean they take the same arguments. Plus, how should I know I need to look\nat net.Dial when all I wanted to do was use smtp.Dial to send a mail?\n\nBtw, some Dial-methods already reference to net.Dial\n\nI think it’s only sensible to add that information because it’s not obvious what\naddr wants/accepts (e.g. named ports possible).\n\n\u003e we're in 1.4 release freeze\n\nWill 1.5 use Github? It was quite interesting getting this to work.\u003c/pre\u003e",
