	"body": "Yes, I see how that's been helpful for the net/rpc package: knowing the size means that you can multiplex RPCs over a single connection. But there are plenty of situations in which the receiver doesn't care how big the message will be. It's even more the case with the current version of the language since there is no reliable way to know if an allocation will fail, so a receiver can't make an informed decision on whether to accept or drop that 1 GiB incoming transmission.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting changing the current properties. I'm suggesting an extension that makes the package useful for large data structures. It could just as well be new packages like \"sgob\" and \"sjson\" but that would result in a lot of duplicate code.",
