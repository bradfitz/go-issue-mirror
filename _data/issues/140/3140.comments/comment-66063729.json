The issue is that the parser is treating\n\n{{.F.key}}\n\nas\n\n{{.F .key}}\n\nIt stopped parsing the chain once it had seen the F (F=mapNiladicFunc here).\n\nI don't understand how your mapVariadicFunc example is supposed to work,\nand that is what I primarily based my reply on.  Did you mean s/.key// in that\ntest case?\u003c/pre\u003e",
