According to the docs, niladic methods can be part of a chain (e.g.\nMethod.Field.Key.Method), but the last one in the chain is able to accept arguments.  \n\nThe particular use case in my application is for a func that returns\nmap[string]func(...interface{}) , so it can be invoked as Func.Key (optional args to the\nfunc referenced by Key)\u003c/pre\u003e",
