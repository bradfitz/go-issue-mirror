I doubt it, and it does not seem to work for me.\n\nFirst, I think someone meant\n  make install clean\nrather than\n  make clean install\n\nSecond, even that could fail with\n  make --jobs=2 install clean\n(One can set #jobs via the shell environment, so this matters.)\n\nI think what was really meant is\n  make install.clean\nwhich comes from Make.common, which also has test.clean and testshort.clean rules.\n\nBut that could be complicated. Why not just offer the simple\n  goinstall foo/bar\n  goinstall -clean-only foo/bar\nas a one-two punch?\u003c/pre\u003e",
