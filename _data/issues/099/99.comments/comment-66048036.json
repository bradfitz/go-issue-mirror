People have different ways of thinking and I don't\nsee what is the big \ndeal to let people format their own code the way they want.\nI too would enjoy being able to solve any problem I have by telling people \"hey, let's\njust do it my way - \nproblem solved\" but it cannot work in practice.\n\nPeople will just end up maintaining a separate version of gofmt that allows more\nflexible configuration. I \nknow that if no one else do this, I will. Being able to have good readability in my own\ncode is more \nimportant to me than other people's desire for uniformity.\u003c/pre\u003e",
