	"body": "In a recent update to either the OS or the dev-tools clang on OSX will refuse to run (with error code 69) until it is run as root, and the license is accepted.\r\n\r\nThe output from ./all.bash when compiling from source is:\r\n```\r\ngo tool dist: cannot invoke C compiler \"clang\": exit status 69\r\n\r\nGo needs a system C compiler for use with cgo.\r\nTo set a C compiler, export CC=the-compiler.\r\nTo disable cgo, export CGO_ENABLED=0.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is a little of a head scratcher. I think the error message could elaborate on a possible cause, so that the users don't think the only solution is to disable cgo.",
