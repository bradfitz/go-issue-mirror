	"body": "A disclaimer first: this is an experiment.\r\n\r\nWe have little changes of unloading OpenAL without crashing the process. My justification for this experiment is the lifecycle of the native code in an Android app. Android never destroys the running apps unless it requires more resources (CPU, memory, etc). It has a lightweight footprint if your application doesn't contain any external native dependencies. \r\n\r\nThe case for native code is different. It's been loaded once on launch and unloaded iff Android destroys the app. We need to measure OpenAL's impact on the battery life before devoting any time to this issue.",
