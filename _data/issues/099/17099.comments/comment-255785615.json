	"body": "\u003e Looking back over the recent failures, there's a very interesting pattern: the indexes printed by the panic are all off by the same amount (that is, the goroutine at rescan index N was supposed to be at index N+M, for a fixed M). Even weirder, M is specifically 33 in most of the failures.\r\n\r\nIn all but [one of the logs](https://build.golang.org/log/2fe597deb692316d5bf7b07bcb0a787e94a8c185), M is one more than the number of background mark workers. Rescanning of mark workers is funny, so there may well be a bug around this.",
