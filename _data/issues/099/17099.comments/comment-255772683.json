So, gcRescan shouldn't be changing underfoot in queueRescan, even if it blocks on the lock. Of course, it's possible we got *that* wrong, but I suspect we didn't: if there were two concurrent calls to queueRescan, I would expect it to fail at least sometimes with \"g already on rescan list\", but that's never happened on the build bots.\r\n\r\nLooking back over the recent failures, there's a very interesting pattern: the indexes printed by the panic are all off by the same amount (that is, the goroutine at rescan index N was supposed to be at index N+M, for a fixed M). Even weirder, M is specifically 33 in most of the failures.",
