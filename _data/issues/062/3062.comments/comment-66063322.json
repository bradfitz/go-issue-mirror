It appears to be a more common style to put a comment\nafter a list entry than before; the new heuristic takes that into account. The existing\ncode base supports this assumptions and the fix improved comment placement for several\npackages with such comments.\n\nOne could selectively store comma position information where needed, but that effort\n(code and space consumption) seems not justified given that the new heuristic appears to\nwork reasonably well (and the case of comments in comma-separated lists is rare, anyway).\u003c/pre\u003e",
