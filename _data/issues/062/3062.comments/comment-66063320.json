I think the proper fix should be: don't move comments to the other\nside of commas.\n\nMy examples:\n        var _ = []int{/* 1 */ x, /* 2 */ y}   /* comments in front of list elements */\n        var _ = []int{x /* 1 */, y /* 2 */ }  /* comments after list elements */\n\nRunning through gofmt produces:\n        var _ = []int{ /* 1 */ x /* 2 */, y}  /* comments in front of list elements */\n        var _ = []int{x /* 1 */, y /* 2 */}   /* comments after list elements */\n\nPreviously, the second line was broken as the /* 1 */ comment would be moved to the\nright of the comma next to the y, so the 'y' had two comments associated with it.\n\nWith the new code, we've instead broken the first case where the comments precede the\nlist elements.  The /* 2 */ on the first line has now moved to the left of the comma so\nnow the 'x' has two comments associated with it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
