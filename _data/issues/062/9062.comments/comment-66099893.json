Right now it's not\nmentioned at all, and is a big departure from the way the previous go tool/gccgo\ninteractions worked (where the go tool was basically backwards compatible).  Plus, when\nyou try this combination (which, btw, is the only possible combination right now w/\n1.4), the errors that you get are really really obscure (missing a function signature\nduring tests).  If go 1.4 does not support gccgo 4.9, there should be a better error\nmessage about the incompatibility when you try it.\u003c/pre\u003e",
