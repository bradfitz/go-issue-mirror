	"body": "My use case is the `syscall` package in std and maybe `x/sys/unix`. Both for the s390x port. We need to add some new struct types to types_linux.go and I haven't thought of a clean way to do it without either adding to the APIs on other platforms or adding a new autogenerated (z*.go) file. It probably isn't worth adding this feature just for this use case, but I thought I'd create an issue in case there was any other interest.\r\n",
