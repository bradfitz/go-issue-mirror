	"body": "by **salvor.public**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eIt would be helpful to know the specific compiler version and settings used to build the\nofficial Go binaries.\n\nFor Mac, FreeBSD and Ubuntu, it is simple to use the default compiler. And there's a\ngood chance someone else is using it with Go.\n\nBut on Windows, it is possible to use a compiler that nobody else on the planet has used\nwith Go. As \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/issue/6833\"\u003eissue #6833\u003c/a\u003e shows, even the same MinGW distro (TDM) can encounter problems\nwhen using a different version. And there are various flavors of MinGW distros and each\nbundled version of gcc within them can have multiple versions (SEH vs SJLC, etc.)\n\nPlease help users avoid needless uncertainty and pitfalls by mentioning the compiler\nversion and settings in the Release notes or FAQ. If that isn't the ideal place, the\nplease consider updating wiki page such as:\n\n \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/WindowsBuild\"\u003ehttps://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/WindowsBuild\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThanks.\u003c/pre\u003e",
