The error you are seeing comes form bzr, not from the go command.\nYour http_proxy really should be a URL.  We have allowed plain host:port in the \ngo command and Go http libraries, but not all tools accept that.  In particular, bzr\ndoes not:\n\n$ http_proxy=127.0.0.1:8000 bzr branch \u003ca href=\"https://launchpad.net/gocheck\"\u003ehttps://launchpad.net/gocheck\u003c/a\u003e /tmp/gocheck\nbzr: ERROR: Invalid url supplied to transport: \"127.0.0.1:8000\": No host component\n$ \n\nThis has nothing to do with the go command.  If you think this behavior is wrong,\nplease file a bug with the bzr authors.\u003c/pre\u003e",
