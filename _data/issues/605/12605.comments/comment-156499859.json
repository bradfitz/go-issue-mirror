	"body": "I might be the exception here, but if I'm building a reverse proxy I will always want to handle the error with a custom function rather than a blank response and a 500. For me it's less of a \"tuning knob\" and more of something that I will always have to implement as a custom transport.\r\n\r\nBut if I'm the exception then I agree, it's definitely an unnecessary addition to the API.\r\n\r\n@bmizerany Thoughts? If we don't want to change ReverseProxy I think your example code would still be a nice addition to the documentation as @nightlyone suggested",
