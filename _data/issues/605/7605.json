	"body": "by **ilarkin@crystalnix.com**:\n\n\u003cpre\u003eWhat does 'go version' print?\n\n  go version go1.2 linux/amd64\n\n\nWhat steps reproduce the problem?\n\n  Code: \u003ca href=\"http://play.golang.org/p/TasQabnlRu\"\u003ehttp://play.golang.org/p/TasQabnlRu\u003c/a\u003e\n\n    1. Create a new *net.TCPConn (using net.Accept)\n    2. Call File()\n    3. Close new file\n    4. Set Read Deadline to 5 seconds\n    5. Start reading\n\n\nWhat happened?\n\n  The reading is never finishes. As the result i see the following output:\n\n    \u0026gt; New Connection: 127.0.0.1:33079\n    \u0026gt; Fd: 7\n    \u0026gt; \n\n\nWhat should have happened instead?\n\n    \u0026gt; New Connection: 127.0.0.1:33079\n    \u0026gt; Fd: 7\n    \u0026gt; Error: read tcp 127.0.0.1:33079: i/o timeout\n\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\nI'm trying to understand why this code sample doesn't work. As i understand, File()\ncreates a copy of the underlying fd. And the new fd has no effect to the original.\n\nOne more thing... If i use only the SetReadDeadline function - timeout doesn't work. But\nif i use it in couple with the syscall.SetsockoptTimeval function - it works.\u003c/pre\u003e",
