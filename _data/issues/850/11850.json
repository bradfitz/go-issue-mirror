	"body": "When a Go program panics, it dumps information on running goroutines, stack trace, error etc. But it's hard for humans to parse. In a terminal, which is where you're most likely to see panics as you're testing your program, the error message is the first line and you have to scroll to see it.\r\n\r\nPython does this really well, as they should, since everything is a runtime \"panic\". The last line is the error message. Then there's a blank line, and then the stack trace in reverse order, so that the frame that had the error is the next line reading up. 95% of the time those last two lines are all you need to see to understand what's going wrong.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see Go lay things out similarly, with the most important information at the bottom, and the least important at the top. It would make debugging Go programs in the terminal a little bit more pleasant. Again that would be the most common case for seeing a panic by far. Production panics are hopefully few and far between.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
