There is\nabsolutely no reason to reject legitimate URLs.  Especially when using ssh since that\nrequires keys.\n\nResult is that I now have to update all dependencies by hand.  This is essentially kills\ngo get for anyone who is a developer.  Sure if I just want run someone else's code I\nlike some protection, but cutting out the guys that generate said code is honestly a\nterrible idea.  Go 1.3 forever I guess :(\n\nAlternatively one can patch go forever more to remove these restrictions but I am pretty\nsure we can all agree that is a pretty terrible idea as well.\n\nPlease fix go 1.4 :(\u003c/pre\u003e",
