Thus, we\nuse Github as a public mirror while maintaining complete administrative control over our\ngit repos.  With the `go get` change, the only method I've found to reliably work is to\nchange every repo to use an alternative push url for the origin remote (and we have a\nlot of repos!) as well as add another internal remote so we can push and pull to\nbranches on our own git server.\n\nThis change has also made it more difficult to fork a git repository, keeping the same\nGOPATH src path (so that import paths do not need to be rewritten) while modifying the\ngit remote so that changes can be pushed and pulled from a public repo (like a forked\nproject on Github).\n\nI also see this change as a security loss.  Besides not recognizing git@github.com URLs\n(which would allow SSH with RSA keys -- currently it can only pull from HTTPS), Github\nSSH only supports RSA, whereas we would prefer to use ECDSA.  This is not an issue when\nwe maintain the git repo ourselves, but that isn't possible if `go get` refuses to fetch\nfrom any place other than Github for github.com/ import paths.\u003c/pre\u003e",
