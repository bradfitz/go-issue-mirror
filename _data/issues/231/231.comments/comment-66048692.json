However now \nyou've also introduced another \"URL matching language\" instead of perhaps using one \nalready familiar.\n\nI would suggest:\n\nhttp.Handle(string, SomeHandler) to be the exact string only (or if you must the \"URL \npattern language\" which is currently used, though I do think the common case is for \nexact string) and:\n\nhttp.HandleRegexp(SomeRegexp, SomeHandler) when something else is required.\n\n(Apologies for silly suggestion of method overloading, I had not fully read the Go \nspecification to understand that this is not done in Go at the time of the issue \nbeing opened.)\u003c/pre\u003e",
