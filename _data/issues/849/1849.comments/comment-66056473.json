Therefore I cannot write an example program without extending\nthe API or it would break valid programs...\n\nAll I can say is : there is currently no way to execute the following command :\n cmd.exe /s /c \"cd \"C:\\Program Files\" \u0026\u0026 dir\"\n\n(I should also mention that the python subprocess.Popen function allows to pass a string\ninstead of a command line on windows (\u003ca href=\"http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html\"\u003ehttp://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html\u003c/a\u003e,\n17.1.1) and does not suffer from this restriction.)\n\nA possible alternative that would fix all my cases would be to not apply any escaping\nfor an argument if it is already enclosed with quotes. I believe this would then\nautomatically handle both the cmd.exe and Delphi program cases without any API\nchanges... \nPrograms needing explicit escaping then can do the escaping before passing the argument\ndown to os.StartProces \u0026 co. Any opinion ?\n\nVincent\u003c/pre\u003e",
