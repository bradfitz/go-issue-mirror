	"body": "I'm looking for a way to limit the max memory consumption of a Go program, say the memory doesn't exceed X. Further discussion is [here](https://plus.google.com/+OwenOu/posts/B8WqDGvR1cf).\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense to make [`runtime.MaxMem`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.4/src/runtime/malloc.h#L152) configurable?\r\n\r\n1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?\r\n1.4.1.\r\n2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?\r\n64 bit Linux.\r\n3. What did you do?\r\nI tried to limit the memory usage of my Go program. The server only has 1GB. The Go process was killed by the monitor process and the server was restarted.\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI expect there's a variable in Go runtime to set this limit, e.g., `runtime.MaxMem = x`.\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\nI couldn't find a way to limit memory usage in Go. `ulimit` may be one option but it's not cross platform. Also `ulimit` requires root access and I don't have it since the server is hosted on Heroku.\r\n\r\n/cc @davecheney ",
