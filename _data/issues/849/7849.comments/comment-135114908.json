	"body": "A C preprocessor conditional would not be a good idea.\r\n\r\nI don't understand how the change in the if_data8 struct is causing trouble.  As far as I can see, if_data8 is used in exactly one place: a field in if_msghdr8.  And as far as I can see, if_msghdr8 is not used at all.  I don't know why those types are defined.\r\n\r\nI think the real problem is the type IfData in ztypes_freebsd_\\*.go, and its effect on IfMsghdr, and its use in route_freebsd_\\*.go.  The code in route_freebsd_32bit.go already does crazy stuff based on the kernel version.  We would just have to do more of it there and in route_freebsd_64bit.go.  Probably we would have to change IfMsghdr to the FreeBSD11 version, which would break compatibility slightly but that's OK since this is the syscall package.",
