	"body": "FreeBSD ports issue for `if_data8`: https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=202504\r\n\r\nRight now, there is a conditionally applied patch that changes the syscall module on FreeBSD-11. I'm not sure what would be a proper approach to get this solved properly in Go source itself without losing compatibility with FreeBSD 10 and earlier. Would a C preprocessor conditional in `types_freebsd.go` be a good idea? In that case, what about the generated `ztypes` files that are checked into the repository?\r\n\r\nLooking at the source, it seems like `golang.org/x/sys/unix` is also affected; not sure how to proceed on that front either.",
