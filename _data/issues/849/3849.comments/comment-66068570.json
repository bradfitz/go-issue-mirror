I looked into xnu and I think there\nmight be a race condition there somewhere. Basically, during accept it takes a malloc'ed\nsockaddr, which could be NULL, and there might be a chance (haven't checked if locking\nis correct) for socket accept to succeed, but sockaddr_in generation to fail (result of\nin_setpeeraddr is not checked for errors) due to a connection being reset in the mean\ntime (another possibility of malloc failing is too unlikely).\n\nIn short, it may be that on Mac OS X accept() may succeed but not fill sockaddr address\nparameter, leaving it with garbage. :(\u003c/pre\u003e",
