Namely: \n\n1. There are two concerns with the way the spec is written. In subsequent discussion,\nthe intent of the spec has been clarified, even if the spec could be phrased better.\n(And I agree, the intent could be made clearer, even if only by giving that how that\nspecific example done in the discussion above.)\n\n2. But given that, as best as I can now tell, there is a bug the way the types have been\nassigned in this particular case. \n\n3. Perhaps there is a weirdness or inelegance in the way constants are handled with\n\"untyped integer\". \n\n4. And finally you mention the weirdness with the multiple sets of conversions on\nint-\u003eunit-\u003euint64 in this specific case.  \n\nI'm probably the wrong person to split this issue up as I really don't understand things\nas well as the others.\u003c/pre\u003e",
