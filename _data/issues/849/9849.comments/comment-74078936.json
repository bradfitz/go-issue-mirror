	"body": "Adding knobs like this can certainly seem attractive but they come with costs in the development cycle. A simple binary knob doubles the number of tests that the Go runtime team has to run. We run those tests a dozen times a day and leave them running every night when we go home. Each CL runs them across more than a dozen HW/OS configurations. This request suggests a non-binary knob where reasonable testing will require more than two values which is even worse. The bar to adding knobs in Go is, and should be, very high.\r\nIt's worse for the application programmer who now turns knobs all day instead of dealing with reducing the amount of live data which in turn will reduce the size of the heap. The GC will try to keep total heap size at about 2X live heap which is what the runtime team is tuning for.",
