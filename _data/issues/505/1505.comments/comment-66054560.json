Consequently the implementation does not try to ensure that no line\nbreaks are inserted where they may cause extra semicolons; instead it now relies\ncritically on correct line information.\n\nThis makes go/printer less useful for printing generated ASTs where there is no line\ninformation (or where it is at least difficult to compute \"reasonable\" line information).\u003c/pre\u003e",
