	"body": "As a counter-proposal to #17503, we could improve STW times by performing stack re-scanning concurrently. I'm not actually proposing this, but I wrote a whole design doc before realizing a simpler approach would let us completely eliminate stack re-scanning. This issue is a place to put that design doc.",
