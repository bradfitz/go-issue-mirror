It turns out it\ndoesn't distinguish between type[] and type[0] when printed out.  The following change\nworks for cgo:\n\ndiff -r 734071724054 src/pkg/debug/dwarf/type.go\n--- a/src/pkg/debug/dwarf/type.go       Sat Apr 07 17:02:44 2012 +0400\n+++ b/src/pkg/debug/dwarf/type.go       Tue Apr 10 22:27:09 2012 -0700\n@@ -332,7 +332,7 @@\n                        switch kid.Tag {\n                        case TagSubrangeType:\n                                max, ok := kid.Val(AttrUpperBound).(int64)\n-                               if !ok {\n+                               if !ok || max == 0 {\n                                        max = -2 // Count == -1, as in x[].\n                                }\n                                if ndim == 0 {\n\nbut appears to break the my_struct1 test.  I have a test in misc/cgo/tests that tests\nboth [] and [#] cases, which appears to work correctly, so I'm at a loss as to why\nanything here changed.\u003c/pre\u003e",
