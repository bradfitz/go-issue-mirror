What I'm looking\nfor is a test case where you use the same regexp for Compile and CompilePOSIX, but get\ndifferent results.\n\nWhat your test case appears to demonstrate is that [:xdigit:] is not equivalent to\n[0-9A-Fa-f], which may be a bug but is not the same as the bug you are reporting.\u003c/pre\u003e",
