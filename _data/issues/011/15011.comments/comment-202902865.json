I found the issue because I was parsing the duration as I got it from somewhere else and this string came.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that this case also fails, but it is a valid time inside precision (59 seconds and one nanosecond, expressed in hours): http://play.golang.org/p/xCp_XyTxXC. If you start removing the last digits, you get 59s, not 59s1ns. You can get 59s1ns if you round it by hand (http://play.golang.org/p/kD8r2ShnNB). I don't know if these cases should be managed by ParseDuration (and Parse may have the same issue).\r\n\r\n",
