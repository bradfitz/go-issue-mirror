Specifically:\r\n\r\nCtrl-A should have Rune == -1.\r\n\r\nCodeReturnEnter has Rune == '\\n', especially as you can't set Rune == \"\\r\\n\" (a string) on Darwin.\r\n\r\nCodeTab should have Rune == '\\t'.\r\n\r\nCodeDeleteBackspace (and CodeEscape) should have Rune == -1. I wouldn't expect a text editor to want '\\x08' or '\\x1b' runes inserted into the text.\r\n\r\nWDYT? I'm happy to do the Linux and Mac changes if there's consensus.",
