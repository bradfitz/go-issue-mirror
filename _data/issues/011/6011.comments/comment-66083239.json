The package uses unsafe\nanyway so it should be easy to achieve optimal speed without demanding much from the\ncompiler. \"Kronecker delta\" comes to mind as possible name or just Bool2XXX\n\nOther than that: I'm in favor of allowing conversion to integer types in the language\n(and maybe floats if it is actually faster than just doing \"float(int(true))\"). Its\nobvious what it does and really nice to have, especially for people who aren't aware\nwhich optimizations the compiler does atm. The other direction (\"bool(1)\") doesn't make\nmuch sense to me because it is not obvious (to me) how to map every value and it is easy\nand fast to do a normal comparison as pointed out earlier.\u003c/pre\u003e",
