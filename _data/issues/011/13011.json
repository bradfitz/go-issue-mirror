	"body": "The documentation for the [encoding/base64](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/base64) package is difficult to follow because some bits are not documented or in a wrong order:\r\n- constants `encodeStd` and `encodeURL` are [not documented](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/base64/#pkg-constants). But they are referenced in the documentation for variables `StdEncoding` and `URLEncoding`...\r\n- `RawStdEncoding` and `RawURLEncoding` variables are documented before `StdEncoding` and `URLEncoding` while the former are defined using the later.\r\n- functions `NewEncoder` and `NewDecoder` are documented before the `Encoding` type and its methods.",
