	"body": "\u003e Another consideration for this proposal is that it will theoretically break anyone that already has packages whose import paths have a src path component.\r\n\r\nA solution could be to say that the GOPATH is the parent of the top (instead of the bottom) src directory in the current directory. So, for example, when running go install from /home/user/src/github.com/project/src/package1, GOPATH would be set to /home/user.\r\n\r\nI think it is more unlikely to break something this way and with the right wording it is not more complicated (I am assuming the fraction of users with GOPATHs inside src directories is neglegible). For new users, I think the most important point is showing a sensible error message when trying to build a package outside of a GOPATH (or with this proposal, outside of a src directory).",
