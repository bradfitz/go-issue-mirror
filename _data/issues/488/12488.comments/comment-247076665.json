They are buildable. And the negative side-effects are mostly independent of whether or not they intend you to set GOPATH to a subdir of the repo.\r\n\r\nAnyway. I just wanted to provide some actual quantitative perspective on this. And state my technical objections to this proposal (namely that it makes it somewhat unpredictable what'll happen if GOPATH in some session isn't set, accidentally). I just don't think this heuristic is very good, is all.",
