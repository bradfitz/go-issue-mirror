	"body": "My concern wasn't so much that the code of other languages would be an issue; only that `src` is a common directory name and I figured there would be some potential conflicts in just assuming that you were working with a Go package's `src` directory when in fact it could be something entirely different. You gave a good example, @mortdeus -- /usr/src could be a conflicting directory if they happened to be working out of it. It's not likely but it could happen.",
