We can use this to synthesize a GOPATH, and to import subdirectories or nearby directories without relative imports.\r\n\r\nConsider\r\n```\r\ndirectory $HOME/foo/bar\r\n    package bar // import \"github.com/broady/bar\"\r\n    import \"github.com/broady/bar/baz\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe expect \"baz\" to be a subdirectory of `$HOME/foo/bar`.\r\nWe can contract `github.com/broady/bar` to `.` and treat it like `import \"./baz\"`.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a prototype and will write up a proposal in more detail. Evidently it has similar drawbacks to relative imports (nowhere to put object files), but has the advantage of retaining explicitness and not conflicting with how `go get` works.\r\n\r\n(and while I was writing this, @MikaelCluseau replied. This proposal addresses his second point)",
