But I must say, it feels rather like 199x if I have to set an environment variable from my shell just to run my compiler or install a package. I get packages, I like them, but I also happen to like having reasonable defaults for tools and having those things in places like /etc/profile.d/ which a lot of Linux distributions use to setup the system wide default environment for a user. Why doesn't Go just use /etc/profile.d/ and set stuff there?  More advanced users can always override those values for whatever they want to do. I'm not sure remaking the wheel, in this situation, is entirely necessary.",
