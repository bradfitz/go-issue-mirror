	"body": "Another idea:\r\n- Add the option to mark gopath by a special file in the directory (.gopath for example)\r\n- Create a go path tool that checks if gopath is set, if not use said heuristics to find the probable directory and ask if this should be your gopath, if so, set the .gopath marker. After running always return/set correct gopath.\r\n- When running a tool that needs gopath, use go path tool to get gopath if it's missing.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n- Existing config doesn't change\r\n- New users will have a gopath setup, but can refuse\r\n- Heuristics can be applied\r\n- Systems without working environment variables for any reason can configure a persistent gopath\r\n- Git style did you mean education which can be improved on\r\n\r\nDisadvantages:\r\n- Heuristics may take time... (possible solution: if this happens, strongly suggest setting $GOPATH, also globally set $GOPATH at first run of tool)",
