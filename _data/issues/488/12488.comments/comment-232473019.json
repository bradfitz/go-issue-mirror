	"body": "I have a counterproposal:\r\n\r\nWhen $GOPATH is unset, behave like \"git clone\" or \"svn checkout\" - place the requested package in the current directory. Place the dependencies in a \"vendor/\" subdirectory under the newly-created directory.\r\n\r\nThus, each invocation of \"go get\" yields a self-contained directory which can be used to build and develop the go-gotten package.\r\n\r\nDownsides:\r\n- \"vendor\" doesn't currently work without $GOPATH (#14566); arguably this is just a bug\r\n- This would leave you with an unclean working copy, or alternately, \"go get\" could exclude the vendor directory it creates, but this gets confusing if the repo already contains some checked-in vendored packages.\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n- Most users who \"go get\" do not care about seeing or modifying the dependencies; they just want to build or edit the package they directly reference.\r\n- This more closely matches the behavior of ~other languages' dependency tools, such as easy_install, cpan, gem, etc.",
