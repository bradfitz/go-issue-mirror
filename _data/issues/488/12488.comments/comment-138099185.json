	"body": "What about `go init [-path]` where `path` defaults to `$HOME/gopath` and be done with it?\r\n\r\nThat could initialize the path, create an directory `example` too with a minimal main + package and fill this with some dummy content working on all major systems. It then also shows what it did (e.g. `go get -v -x example/...`), where it puts the stuff and what it actually is (e.g. a minimal binary, an example package, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhen the `$GOPATH` is missing, suggest setting `$GOPATH`  or calling `go init` to the user, if he doesn't know what we are talking about.\r\n\r\n(Linux- )Distributions could then also easily integrate `go init`, if their policy needs defaults.\r\n\r\n(Appropriate defaults for e.g. Windows are left out for the moment but can be easily added)",
