	"body": "How about a new `go` command, say `go new`. It would create a new project and could serve as a introduction to new users. On first run it may look like:\r\n```\r\n~ $ go new\r\nEnter a project name. This typically looks like: github.com/user/project\r\n\u003e user/entered/name\r\nYou do not seem to have a $GOPATH set. This is required for go to manage dependencies.\r\n$GOPATH location [/home/username/go]:\r\n\u003e \r\n```\r\nThe tool would then create the $GOPATH structure, and add it to wherever you add $GOPATH on your os. It might also copy the default go playground example, or similar, to the new project directory and `cd` there. It could also, optionally, add `$GOPATH/bin` to your $PATH, or at least give guidance on how `go install` works.\r\n\r\nI think this would help new users understand the gopath structure hands-on, without having to change other tools.",
