	"body": "If the original proposal gets adopted it might also make sense to make any `vendor` dir auto set as the gopath rather then continuing to walk up the file tree to a `src`. That way you could `cd` into the vendor directory and have the normal go tools work on just the vendored code but also allow `go get` to work as vendoring tool. \r\n\r\nThe vendoring stuff would need to be figured out more before the `go get` stuff would be useful inside the vendor dir. However, making the auto-detect work in the meantime for vendor as well might still be desirable. It might even affect plans around standardizing the location of the manifest file and how many vendor dirs can exist per project and where they should be.",
