When I ran that by hand, the error message was a little more clear:\r\n\r\n```\r\n=== BUILD TARGET main OF PROJECT main WITH CONFIGURATION Release ===\r\n\r\nCheck dependencies\r\nCode Sign error: No matching provisioning profiles found: No provisioning profiles matching the bundle identifier “org.golang.todo.main” were found.\r\nCodeSign error: code signing is required for product type 'Application' in SDK 'iOS 8.3'\r\n\r\n** BUILD FAILED **\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following build commands failed:\r\n\tCheck dependencies\r\n(1 failure)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be good if the output from `gomobile build` included the full output from `xcrun xcodebuild`.",
