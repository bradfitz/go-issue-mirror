I don't believe there are any examples of external APIs that demonstrate this problem, so we're not likely to make changes for a single non-public (and therefore not widely used) server.\r\n\r\nWhat about `http://server.com/api/item.json?aegjadrlfgdks=` or `http://server/api/item.json?1` ? Does the server ignore unexpected variables, or is that yet another page?\r\n\r\nIt is still possible to create an HTTP request explicitly and then modify its URL to set the Opaque field to \"/api/item.json?\", if you must make calls to the server this way.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should take any steps to help the situation unless there is evidence that it's a common problem for Go users. It seems like an isolated incident.\r\n",
