The Hub runs an HTTP server on port 80 speaking unauthenticated, unencrypted JSON.\r\n\r\nBut .... if you leave off the trailing question mark in certain queries, the hub crashes.\r\n\r\nAnother person who hit this: http://forum.universal-devices.com/topic/16538-hunter-douglas-powerview-control-with-isy/ who says:\r\n\r\n\u003e 3 - Whew, now time to get the SceneID's, open a browser, I used Chrome, enter http://(Your Hub IP)/api/scenes? (note: the ? is required or the hub will hang)  If all goes well, you should get a JSON result like this: (Mine of course, yours will vary)\r\n\r\nI'm reopening this bug, not because we'll necessarily change anything, but because it was closed for lack for external examples.",
