Thanks!\r\n\r\n### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\r\ntip\r\n\r\n### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\nUbuntu 16.04\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\nBroke the ppc64le builder with my change to improve the bytes.Compare function. This was tested and working fine but in the latest update to add tabs instead of spaces a register was incorrectly changed from R14 to R4 causing byteCompares to fail for those \u003e= 32 bytes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
