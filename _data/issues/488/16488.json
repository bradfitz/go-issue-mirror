What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?\r\n\r\nOSX amd64\r\n\r\n3. What did you do?\r\n\r\nI am using net/http to request a URL. This URL is streaming data back and I can see the data when I use `curl`. I can also see the data, when I read from the raw tcp connection provdided through `net/http/httputil`. But I do not see the data when I read `response.Body`. This is however not always the case, when I try other URLs I can read the data. There seems to something special about mine. These are the response headers: \r\n\r\n```\r\n\u003c HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\u003c Cache-Control: private\r\n\u003c Transfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\u003c Content-Type: application/json;odata.metadata=minimal;IEEE754Compatible=false;charset=utf-8\r\n\u003c Server: Microsoft-IIS/8.0\r\n\u003c X-BackEndHttpStatus: 200\r\n\u003c Set-Cookie: fubarcookie=a5771fb58997980808080980039a32af2; expires=Tue, 25-Jul-2017 09:58:21 GMT; path=/; HttpOnly\r\n\u003c OData-Version: 4.0\r\n\u003c X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319\r\n\u003c X-Powered-By: ASP.NET\r\n\u003c Date: Mon, 25 Jul 2016 09:58:21 GMT\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nI expect to be able to read the data from `response.Body`.\r\n\r\n5. What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nNo data when reading from `response.Body`.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
