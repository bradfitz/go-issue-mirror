# Go Issue Tracker Mirror

This repo is a mirror of the
[Go Issue Tracker](https://github.com/golang/go/issues).

The goal is to permit offline access and more powerful searches. It
also doesn't take any quota to query this way.

This repo is entirely data, not code. The tools for updating it and
reading will live elsewhere. They will be linked from here when ready.
